Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, what does that reaction typically do?

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, right? It's often used for dehydrohalogenation, like elimination reactions. But wait, in aromatic substitution reactions, maybe it's involved in deprotonation or something else. Oh wait, wait a second. 1-bromobenzene-2-d—so the d is probably a deuterium, meaning it's a bromobenzene derivative with a deuterium substituent in the ortho position. But wait, wait, no—1-bromo means the bromine is on carbon 1, and the deuterium is on carbon 2. Or is it that the molecule is 1-bromo and 2-deutero benzene? So the structure has a Br at position 1 and a D (deuterium) at position 2.

So the question is about what happens when this is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, used in dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes from vicinal dihalides, but wait, this is an aromatic compound. Oh, right, in the aromatic context, NaNH2 is often used for elimination reactions to form rings with more unsaturation, like forming rings with double bonds, but benzene is already aromatic. Or wait, maybe it's about deprotonation.

Wait, benzene is generally pretty stable, but if there are substituents that make certain protons acidic, perhaps NaNH2 can abstract a proton. But in bromobenzene, the presence of the electron-withdrawing bromine might make the adjacent protons more acidic. But if the bromine is in position 1, and the deuterium is in position 2, then perhaps the hydrogen in position 3 or 4 is more acidic.

Wait, but the molecule given is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the structure is bromine on C1, deuterium on C2, and others are hydrogens. So in this case, with NaNH2, which is a strong base, would it abstract a proton adjacent to the bromine?

Wait, but wait another thing: when you have a benzene ring with a strong electron-withdrawing group like bromine, the adjacent hydrogens (ortho and para to the Br) become more acidic because the EWG stabilizes the negative charge when a proton is removed. So for 1-bromobenzene, the ortho (C2) and para (C4) positions are more acidic.

But wait, in the given compound, position 2 already has a deuterium. So the more acidic protons would be at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6. But wait, position 3 is meta to the Br, position 4 is para, position 5 is meta again, position 6 is ortho to Br but that's where the D is. Hmm.

Wait, but if the deuterium is at C2, then the adjacent positions are C1 (Br), C3, and C6. So under basic conditions, which protons are more likely to be abstracted? The ortho and para to the Br, which are adjacent to the deprotonated site.

Wait, but C2 is already D, so perhaps the adjacent H are at C3 and C6.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. So, elimination. But in aromatic compounds, elimination would typically form a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not sure that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that usually requires activating groups and a good leaving group. The Br is a leaving group, but in this case, we're using a strong base, not a nucleophile. So maybe it's more about deprotonation and elimination.

Wait, when you have a dihalobenzene, like 1,2-dibromobenzene, treating with a strong base can cause elimination to form a benzene ring with a double bond, like styrene or something. But in this case, we only have a bromine and a deuterium.

Wait, but wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the Br is replaced by something. But with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps the solvent is aprotic? Wait, but ammonia is a weak base, but when condensed, NaNH2 is a strong base in it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a triple bond? But again, in an aromatic system, perhaps the ring becomes more unsaturated.

Wait, perhaps the deuterium is a problem. So, the molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So when treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it might abstract a proton adjacent to the Br. Let's think about which positions are available.

So the molecule is:

Positions:
1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So the base will abstract a proton that is adjacent to Br. That would be positions 2, 3, or 6. But position 2 is already D. So the possible positions are 3 and 6.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, that's adjacent to C2 (D) and C4. Wait, but in the benzene ring, each C is connected to two adjacent Cs. So if the base abstracts a proton from C3, then the C3 becomes a carbanion, right? But with Br on C1, which is adjacent to C2 (D) and C6.

Wait, once the proton is abstracted, perhaps a double bond forms between C1 and C2? Or wait, wait, no. Let me think again. If the base abstracts a proton from a position adjacent to Br, say position 3, which is adjacent to C2 and C4. Wait, no, actually, C3 is adjacent to C2 and C4. Hmm, no, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C1 and C3. So if the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is adjacent to C2 (D) and C4.

Wait, but the Br is on C1. If the base abstracts a proton from C2, but that's already D. So the next possible is C3 and C6.

Wait, perhaps I should draw this out mentally. So, let's number the benzene ring. Position 1 is Br, position 2 is D, position 3 is H, position 4 is H, position 5 is H, position 6 is H. The base (NaNH2) is a strong base that can deprotonate acidic hydrogens.

In bromobenzene, the para position (C4) and ortho positions (C2 and C6) have more acidic hydrogens. But C2 is D, so the next possible is C3 and C6. Wait, wait, C6 is adjacent to C1 (Br) and C5. So, H on C6 is ortho to Br, correct? So the H on C6 is ortho to the Br. So that's a more acidic position.

So the base could abstract a proton from C6, which is ortho to Br, making a carbanion at C6. Then, perhaps, the Br leaves as Br-, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, that's a possibility. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is meta to Br, but I'm not sure if that's as acidic.

Wait, but the positions adjacent to Br (ortho) are C2 and C6. Since C2 is D, the only possible ortho H is C6. So the base will abstract the H from C6, making a carbanion at C6. Then, the Br is a leaving group, so perhaps elimination occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C6, which are adjacent. Then, the structure would become a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, but that's part of the ring, so perhaps it's just a benzene ring. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, wait, no. Benzene is already a six-membered ring with three double bonds. If a double bond forms between C1 and C6, but that's already part of the aromatic structure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the elimination leads to the formation of a ring contraction or expansion, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps after deprotonation, the Br leaves, and a triple bond is formed. Wait, that seems unlikely because benzene rings don't typically form triple bonds in such reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, and the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but that's not how rings work. Wait, benzene has delocalized electrons, so adding a double bond elsewhere might not change the ring's aromaticity but could lead to a different structure.

Wait, maybe I should think about this differently. If the base abstracts a proton from C6, which is ortho to Br, then the adjacent C1 (Br) and C6 become a deprotonated site. Then, the Br- leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6. But wait, in benzene, that's already part of the ring. So maybe the product is a ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, which is part of the ring, so the structure remains benzene but with a missing H from C6.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C6, but that's already part of the structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C6, leading to the formation of a carbanion at C6. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C6, but that doesn't change the ring's structure. Wait, perhaps this is a ring contraction where the benzene becomes a cyclopentadienyl ion or something else, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves the formation of a benzyn intermediate. Benzynes are aryne intermediates, which are highly strained but can form through dehydrohalogenation. So, if the base abstracts a proton from C6, and the Br leaves, we could form a triple bond between C1 and C6, making a benzyne. But wait, benzyne is a diradical, and it's formed through elimination of HBr from 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene, for example. Wait, but in this case, with a deuterium, would that affect the reaction?

Wait, if the base abstracts a proton from C6, the Br on C1 leaves, and we get a triple bond between C1 and C6, forming a benzyne. But wait, benzyne is a very reactive species. But how does the deuterium affect this?

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium is in the ortho position, so when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the Br leaves, and the resulting structure is a triple bond between 1 and 6, creating a benzyne intermediate. But wait, benzyne is a high-energy molecule, and reactions can occur quickly.

But the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if the reaction forms a benzyne, what would happen? Benzyne can dimerize or undergo other reactions, but in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is aprotic. So maybe the benzyne doesn't dimerize but instead acts as a dienophile or something else.

Wait, but if the benzyne forms, perhaps it can undergo [2+4] cycloaddition reactions, but without any dienes present, maybe it's not relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne rearranges.

Wait, but perhaps the base is used in such a way that it promotes a different kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the Br is replaced by a strong base, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from C3, which is meta to Br, but I'm not sure if that's as acidic. Wait, but the acidity order in bromobenzene is ortho > para > meta. So C6 (ortho) is more acidic than C4 (para), which is more than C3 (meta). So the base would preferentially abstract the proton from C6, which is ortho to Br.

So, abstracting H from C6, adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion, and then the Br leaves, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6, creating a benzyne (aryne) intermediate.

But wait, if benzyne forms, perhaps it can undergo some reaction. But in the presence of a base, maybe it doesn't do much else. Alternatively, maybe the benzyne is unstable and would immediately undergo some ring-opening or other reactions.

Wait, but considering the reaction conditions, it's in condensed ammonia with NaNH2. So perhaps the benzyne isn't isolable and instead undergoes further reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo some kind of addition, but without any dienophile or other reactants, maybe it doesn't. So perhaps the main product is the benzyne, but maybe it can rearrange.

Wait, but wait, in the benzyne structure, the triple bond between C1 and C6 would be highly strained. So perhaps it'somerizes to a different position. But in benzene, any triple bond would still be part of the ring, so maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as an elimination but instead as a substitution. But with NaNH2, which is a strong base, substitution would require a good leaving group, which Br is. But in aromatic substitution, you usually need a strong activating group for nucleophilic attack, which Br is a deactivating group. So nucleophilic aromatic substitution is less likely.

Wait, but in some cases, a strong base can cause elimination rather than substitution. So perhaps the main product is the benzyne, but how many products does that form?

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When the base abstracts a proton from C6, we eliminate HBr and form a triple bond between C1 and C6. Then, the molecule becomes a benzyne, which can tautomerize or have some ring changes. But in benzene, the triple bond would be between C1 and C6, but that's part of the ring. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ring with a triple bond, like a cycloheptatriene or something, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, the possible reactions are dehydrohalogenation, possibly forming a triple bond (benzyne), or perhaps deprotonation leading to a rearrangement.

Wait, but if the benzyne forms, that's a possible product. But benzyne is a diradical and might not be a stable product under these conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne undergoes further reactions. But without any other reactants, perhaps the product is just the benzyne, which is an intermediate.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible organic products. So if the reaction leads to only one product, the answer would be 1, but perhaps there are multiple possibilities.

Wait, but in the starting material, there's a deuterium at position 2. So when the base abstracts a proton from position 6, the H removed is from C6, which is ortho to Br. So the structure becomes a triple bond between C1 and C6. But wait, in the starting material, the D is on C2. So the benzyne would have the triple bond between C1 and C6, and the D is on C2. So the product would have the same positions except for the Br and H/D arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the reaction could result in more than one product depending on where the elimination occurs. But in this case, the H can only be abstracted from C6, because the other ortho position (C2) is D and can't be abstracted (since D is less acidic than H, but I'm not sure if that's the case. Wait, actually, deuterium is slightly less acidic than H, but under strong basic conditions, maybe the base can abstract D as well, but in this case, the D is on C2, and the H on C6 is the only possible one.

Wait, no, wait, the base is NaNH2, which is a strong base, so it can abstract protons but not deuterium. Because deuterium is less acidic than H; the pKa of D is about 35-40, while H has a pKa around 15-20 (in different solvents). So NaNH2, which is a strong base (pKa of NH2^- is around 38?), might not abstract deuterium. So in this case, the H on C6 is the only one that can be abstracted.

So the elimination would occur at C6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6, making benzyne.

But then, how many products would that be? If only one product is formed, the answer would be B) 1.

Wait, but wait another angle: perhaps the reaction could result in multiple isomers. But in this case, the starting material is symmetric in some way. Let me think about the structure. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the positions are Br on C1, D on C2, and H on C3, C4, C5, C6.

If the base abstracts the H from C6, then elimination occurs, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. But considering the positions, is there any possibility of forming another product? For example, if the base abstracts a different H, but in this case, the only possible ortho H is C6, as C2 is D.

Alternatively, could the base abstract a para H, like C4? The para position to Br is C4. So H on C4 is more acidic than meta positions but less than ortho. So perhaps the base could abstract H from C4 as well. But would that lead to a different product?

Let me think: abstracting H from C4 would lead to elimination of Br from C1, forming a double bond between C1 and C4. But wait, in benzene, that's not possible because the ring is already conjugated. Wait, no, benzene has alternating single and double bonds. So, forming a double bond between C1 and C4 would actually create a longer conjugated system.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. If a double bond forms between C1 and C4, that's three carbons apart. Wait, but in benzene, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons. So the positions are as follows: C1 is connected to C2 and C6. C4 is connected to C3 and C5. So, if H is abstracted from C4, adjacent to C3 and C5, and the Br is on C1. So if the base abstracts H from C4, that's para to Br. Then, elimination would occur between C1 and C4, forming a double bond between them. But that's a distance of three carbons, which is impossible in a six-membered ring. So that can't happen.

Wait, that can't form a double bond because C1 and C4 are not adjacent. So that would lead to a diradical or some other structure, but perhaps it's not feasible. So the only possible H to abstract is from C6, leading to a benzyne.

Wait, but benzyne is a very strained and reactive intermediate. So, in the reaction conditions, perhaps it doesn't form a stable product but instead reacts further. But without any other reactants, perhaps the main product is the benzyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne can undergo some kind of ring-opening or other rearrangement. But without more details, it's hard to say.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base deprotonates C6, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge at C6 and Br leaving. But that would form a benzyne, which could then tautomerize or rearrange.

But regardless, the question is about how many possible products are formed. If the only product is the benzyne, then the answer is 1. But sometimes, in such reactions, multiple products can form based on the pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but instead leads to a di-substituted benzene through some other mechanism. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. So, the Br is replaced by something else. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile, so substitution via SN2 is unlikely. Unless it's a meta-directing group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products. If the reaction leads to the formation of benzyne, which is a reactive intermediate, then it might not be a stable product. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as expected, and no product forms. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not likely because NaNH2 is a strong base and would deprotonate the ortho H.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the structure again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So, the positions are Br at C1, D at C2, and H at C3, C4, C5, C6.

When NaNH2 is added, it will abstract an acidic proton. The most acidic is the H ortho to Br, which is at C6. So the base abstracts H from C6, leading to the formation of a carbanion at C6. Then, the Br leaves as Br-, and a triple bond forms between C1 and C6, creating a benzyne.

But benzyne is an aryne, which is a very reactive intermediate. In the presence of a base like NaNH2, perhaps it can undergo some addition reactions. But without any other reactants, maybe it just remains as benzyne. So, the product would be a benzyne, which is a single product. So the number of possible organic products is 1, making the answer B) 1.

Wait, but wait another possibility. If the benzyne can undergo some ring-opening or rearrangement, perhaps it forms a different structure. But in the absence of other reagents, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzyne could dimerize to form biphenylene or something else, but that's probably not the case in this reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should recall some similar reactions. For example, treating bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia leads to the formation of benzyne. Then, benzyne can react in various ways, but if no other reagents are present, it might just form and be unstable, but perhaps the question is considering the benzyne as the product.

But the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, if the benzyne is the only product, then the answer is 1. But sometimes, elimination can lead to different products based on where the H is abstracted.

Wait, but in this case, the H can only be abstracted from C6, because the other ortho position is D. So, only one product is formed.

Wait, unless the deprotonation occurs at a different position. For example, could the base abstract a proton from the para position (C4) instead? The H on C4 is para to Br, which is more acidic than meta but less than ortho. But since the base is strong (NaNH2), maybe it can abstract from the para position as well.

If that's the case, then two different elimination products could form: one from C6 and another from C4. But wait, can you form a triple bond between C1 and C4? That would be a distance of three carbons apart, which isn't possible in a six-membered ring.

So, abstracting a proton from C4 (para to Br) would not lead to a feasible elimination product. So, the only possible elimination is from C6, leading to benzyne.

Thus, only one product is formed, so the answer is B) 1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base that typically promotes deprotonation and elimination. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, has a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. The hydrogens at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 are acidic due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the bromine atom, with the ortho and para positions being the most acidic.

In this case, the ortho position to bromine at position 2 is occupied by a deuterium, which is less acidic than a hydrogen and cannot be abstracted by the base. Therefore, the base will abstract the hydrogen at position 6, which is ortho to bromine. This leads to the formation of a carbanion at position 6, followed by the elimination of bromide (Br⁻), resulting in the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This creates a benzyne intermediate, which is a highly strained and reactive species.

Given the reaction conditions, no other elimination or substitution pathways are feasible. The para position (C4) is less acidic than the ortho position (C6), and abstracting a proton from the meta position (C3 or C5) would not lead to a stable product. Thus, the only possible product is the benzyne intermediate formed by elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between C1 and C6.

Since only one product is formed in this reaction, the number of possible organic products is **1**.
