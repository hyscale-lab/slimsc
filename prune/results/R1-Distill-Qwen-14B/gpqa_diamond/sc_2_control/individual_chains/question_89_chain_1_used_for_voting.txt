Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem that I'm trying to work through. It's about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane has this unique structure, kind of like a diamondoid, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons, right?

The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. Wait, KOH is a strong base. I think when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalo) react with KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction to form an alkene. But here it's 1,3-dibromo, which isn't vicinal. Oh wait, maybe it's more like a dehydrohalogenation but for non-adjacent bromines. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, maybe it's a double elimination. Or perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think when 1,3-dihalides are treated with strong bases, they can undergo a double dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Because each bromide leaves, and two hydroxide ions take protons, leading to the formation of a triple bond. Oh right! So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr to form an alkyne. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantane diamine... wait, no. Wait, when you eliminate two HBr from 1,3-dibromo, you form a triple bond. So the product would be 1,3-didehydrogenated adamantane, which is an alkyne. I think the product would be an adamantane with a triple bond between C1 and C3. So the product is called 1,3-didehydroadamatane, or maybe 1,3-adamantane diyne? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure of adamantane is such that the two carbons are across from each other, so elimination would form a triple bond. So the product is an alkyne, making it a diyne? Wait, no, because they are removing two Br atoms and adding a triple bond, so it's a single triple bond. So the compound becomes decahedrane or something similar? Hmm, maybe I should think about the IR data given.

The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a strong carbonyl peak. So maybe it's not an alkyne. Oh wait, maybe I got it wrong. If two bromides are eliminated, but maybe it's a substitution? Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in that sense. Wait, but when you have a dihalide and a strong base, maybe the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination. So for 1,3-dibromide, perhaps it forms an epoxide? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination forming a diene, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong reaction. Another possibility is that the 1,3-dibromide reacts with KOH to form a gem-diolate, but that's more for epoxide ring opening. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction, but with KOH, more elimination is expected.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe the product has a ketone. Oh! Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. But how?

Wait, another thought: when two adjacent CH2Br groups undergo elimination, perhaps they form a carbonyl. Wait, if the structure is such that eliminating two HBr's would form a carbonyl group. Let me imagine the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. So if each bridgehead has a Br, and the adjacent carbons have H's, perhaps eliminating both Br's would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, for example, if you have two adjacent CH2Br groups, eliminating both would form a double bond, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ketone. Wait, that doesn't quite fit. Oh, wait, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, where each elimination forms a double bond, but in a way that creates a conjugated system leading to a carbonyl. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an E2 elimination, but for each Br, but since they're 1,3 apart, maybe it's a conjugated elimination. Let me think, if each Br is on a bridgehead, maybe the structure has two Brs on opposite ends. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves as Br- and H is abstracted, leading to a triple bond. But earlier I thought that would form a carbon-carbon triple bond.

Wait, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is usually a ketone. So maybe the product is a ketone. How could that happen? If the two bridgehead carbons lose Br and form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't give a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the right structure. Let me think: The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The structure of adamantane is such that each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on each of two bridgeheads, each connected via CH2 groups.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated via an E2 mechanism, abstracting a β-hydrogen. But since the Brs are on opposite bridgeheads, elimination would form a triple bond.

Wait, but if the product is an alkyne, the IR shouldn't show a carbonyl. So that's conflicting. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the product isn't an alkyne but a diketone. How?

Another approach: looking at the 1H NMR of product 1.

The NMR has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

4.79 ppm is around where an alcohol or an ether would be, but more likely an alcohol. But wait, the reaction is with KOH, which is a strong base, so perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide? No, wait, no, that would require a different setup.

Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) suggests two equivalent protons in a deshielded environment. Maybe it's an alcohol group, but in a strong base, that would have been deprotonated. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or an aldehyde, but then the H would be a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, but again, the coupling might be different.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but under basic conditions, it would form a carboxylate. Hmm.

Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be from an epoxide. Epoxide protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, so that could fit. But if it's an epoxide, the IR would show a peak around 1250 cm-1, which is for the C-O-C stretch. But the given IR is at 1720, so that's more likely a carbonyl.

So perhaps the product is a ketone.

Wait, but how does elimination of two Br atoms lead to a ketone?

Maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when two HBr are eliminated, a carbonyl group forms. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, but that's not the case here since it's 1,3.

Wait, maybe each elimination forms a double bond, and the combination creates a conjugated diene. But that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring opening or something else.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so each bridgehead is connected to two CH2 groups. So the 1 and 3 positions are across from each other. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two opposite bridgeheads.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, forming a triple bond between the two bridgeheads. So the product would be 1,3-didehydroadamatane, an alkyne. But the IR should show a peak around 2100 cm-1 for the triple bond. However, the IR given is 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe my initial assumption about the reaction is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base induces a substitution reaction, not elimination. But KOH is a base, more likely to cause elimination. But maybe in this case, it's a substitution because of the structure of adamantane.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromide is symmetric. So perhaps it's a double substitution, forming a carbonyl group. Wait, substitution of Br with OH? But that would give a diol, but the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution forming a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which upon treatment with KOH undergoes a double elimination to form a diketone. How?

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe an ether, but more likely an alcohol or a carbonyl. Wait, if it's a carbonyl, that would be a ketone, but then the H would be more upfield. Wait, no, the 4.79 is a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, for example, if it's a ketone, maybe the CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl. So like (CH2)2CO. Then the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would appear around 2.3 ppm, but in the NMR, 2.41-2.23 is 10H. Wait, 10H in that region suggests maybe five sets of CH2 groups. Hmm.

Wait, the 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But then the IR would show the epoxide C-O-C peak, not a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. For example, a cyclic ketone. Alternatively, maybe the product is a gem-dimethyl ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could lead to the formation of a diol, but that would be substitution, not elimination. But I thought KOH would cause elimination, not substitution. Wait, but if it's a strong base, perhaps it's more likely to eliminate.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a double elimination, each Br is removed, and two hydroxide ions take protons, leading to formation of a triple bond. So the product is an alkyne. But then what about the IR peak?

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So maybe the initial product isn't an alkyne. Maybe the reaction is different. Perhaps it's a substitution reaction but involving two hydroxide ions replacing the bromines.

Wait, substitution of Br with OH would form 1,3-diol, but that would not give a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's some kind of oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of the product again. Let's imagine that 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH, forms a carbonyl. How?

Wait, maybe it's a case of benzilic acid rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a ketone via elimination of HBr from a vicinal dihalide, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again. The product 1 has H's at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let's count the hydrogens. 2 +10 +2=14 H. Adamantane has 12 H, but the product would have more because of the elimination. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has 12 - 2 (each Br replaces an H) = 10 H. Wait, no, each Br is on a CH2 group. So each Br replaces a H on a CH2, so 1,3-dibromo would have 12 - 2 = 10 H. So product 1 has 14 H. Wait, that doesn't add up. Oh wait, wait, no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is C10H14Br2. Because adamantane is C10H16, so substitution of two H's with Br would make C10H14Br2.

When treated with KOH, if it undergoes elimination of two HBr, each elimination removes H and Br, so each elimination reduces H by 1 and Br by 1. So two eliminations would remove 2 H and 2 Br, so the product would be C10H12. But product 1's NMR has 14 H. Wait, that's more than the starting material. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which would have 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens. Because adamantane is C10H16, removing two H (adding two Br) would leave 14 H. So product 1, which is formed by eliminating two HBr, would lose two H and two Br, so would have 14-2=12 H. But the NMR of product 1 has 14 H. Hmm, that doesn't add up. So perhaps my initial assumption about the reaction is incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. If each Br is replaced by an OH, then product would be a diol. The formula would be C10H14(OH)2. That would have 14-2 + 2 = 14 H. Which matches the NMR. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanediol. Then, the IR would show O-H stretches, but the given IR is 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe it's not the diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's think: How could 1,3-dibromoadamantane form a ketone upon reaction with KOH.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. But KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in that sense. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a pinacol-like rearrangement. Pinacol rearrangement occurs when a vicinal diol loses water to form a carbonyl. But that's under acidic conditions, not basic. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a different mechanism. If each Br is on a bridgehead, perhaps upon treatment with KOH, each Br leaves as Br-, and the adjacent C-H bonds break, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. How?

Wait, imagine each Br is on a CH2 group. If KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming a carbonyl. But since the two Brs are on opposite bridgeheads, each elimination would form a carbonyl on each bridgehead. So two ketone groups would form. But that would require each elimination to form a ketone, leading to a diketone.

Wait, if the product is 1,3-adamantanedicarbaldehyde or something, but the IR peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is more in line with a ketone than an aldehyde. So maybe it's a diketone.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 has 14 H. Let's see: if the product is a diketone, each ketone is a (C=O) group. The rest would be CH2 groups. Let me imagine the structure. Suppose the product is 1,3-diketoadamantane. So each bridgehead has a C=O group.

How many H's would that have? Each bridgehead would have a carbonyl, and the adjacent CH2 groups. Let's see: the adamantane structure has four rings. If two of the bridgeheads have ketones, each connected to a CH2 group. So the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. Each CH2 would have protons around 2.3 ppm, maybe as a multiplet.

But the NMR given for product 1 has 4.79 (2H), which doesn't fit with CH2 next to a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe each elimination forms a ketone, but the two ketones are conjugated. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol that's then oxidized, but I don't think KOH would oxidize. Hmm.

I think I'm stuck on the first step. Maybe I should try to think about the next steps and see if that helps.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, the product after product 1 is an alkyne or a ketone. If product 1 is an alkyne, then treating it with Al isopropoxide might lead to some cyclization or addition. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it undergoes a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but ketones aren't usually activated for that.

Wait, but product 1's IR is at 1720, so it's a carbonyl. Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Let's say it's a cyclohexanone ring. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's under heat and requires a diene and a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a Grignard reagent, but I don't think so because Al isopropoxide is more about Lewis catalysis.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, it might facilitate some kind of enol formation or enolate formation, leading to addition or condensation reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al isopropoxide catalyzes a Diels-Alder reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should try to think about the ozonolysis step. Ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups.

So product 3 is formed after ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Let me backtrack. If product 1 is a ketone, then product 2 is formed by heating with Al isopropoxide. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or something with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, a base, it forms an enolate, which could react further. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an alkyne, then product 2 could be an alkene, perhaps via a hydration reaction. Wait, but what's the role of Al isopropoxide in that case?

Another angle: the IR of product 1 is at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. Let's say product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedicarboxylic acid, but no, that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone. Let's imagine that the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH forms a ketone via elimination. So the product is a diketone.

Wait, but the NMR has 2H at 4.79. Hmm, maybe it's an epoxide, but I'm not getting the right IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-diketone, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone. Alternatively, maybe the structure has a carbonyl group with adjacent CH2 groups, which would explain the multiplet in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 ppm (2H) corresponds to a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether. But then why the IR at 1720? Maybe it's a carbonyl elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, but the IR doesn't show the O-H stretch.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that product 1 is a diester. But that would require more oxygen.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the IR. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. Maybe it's an ester or a ketone. If it's an ester, then the NMR might show an OCH2 group, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic carbonate or something else, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 (2H), which is a singlet perhaps. Singlet because the two H are equivalent and have no neighboring H. So maybe it's a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen, in a symmetrical environment.

So perhaps the structure is something like (CH2)2O, but in a larger molecule.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Then the 4.79 ppm would be the two equivalent H on the epoxide. But then the IR should show the epoxide C-O-C peak around 1250 cm-1. The given IR peak is 1720, which is more of a ketone or ester.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, in a structure like R-CO-CH2-CH2-R. Then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be around 2.3 ppm, but the 4.79 is higher. So perhaps it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diepoxide, but I don't see how that would form from the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 ppm is from an alkene. But alkenes typically have protons around 5-6 ppm. So 4.79 is a bit lower, perhaps for an allylic position.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is a diol, then the 4.79 could be the OCH2 group. But as I thought earlier, the IR wouldn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl with adjacent CH2 groups. For example, R-CO-CH2-CH2-R. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would typically be around 2.3-2.5 ppm, which matches the 2.41-2.23 (10H) region. Then the 4.79 could be from another group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.79 is from a methylene adjacent to an oxygen. Like an ether or an ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an adjacent CH2O group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there's a ketone and an epoxide. But I'm not making progress here.

Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider the overall sequence. The first reaction forms product 1, which is then treated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis to form product 3.

So product 3 is after ozonolysis of product 2, which suggests that product 2 has a double bond. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

So the structure of product 2 must have a double bond.

Let me think about the steps again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (IR 1720, NMR as given)
2. product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2 (which has a double bond)
3. product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3

So, product 2 has a double bond, product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

So, product 1 must have a group that, when treated with Al isopropoxide, forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and under Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination to form an alkene.

Alternatively, if product 1 is an alcohol, perhaps it undergoes elimination to form an alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Al isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid and can catalyze Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But for that, the substrate would need to be an aromatic ring, which adamantane derivatives are not.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl compound that undergoes a [2,3]-Witting rearrangement or similar, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with Al isopropoxide, it undergoes a pinacol-like rearrangement to form a diene.

Wait, the pinacol rearrangement involves a 1,2-diol losing water to form a carbonyl. But product 1 isn't a diol; it's a ketone or similar.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and under Al isopropoxide, it loses water to form a carbonyl. But that doesn't fit with the IR at 1720.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, which when heated with Al isopropoxide, undergoes elimination to form a diene. Then product 2 would have two double bonds or a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis would cleave into smaller fragments.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 has 2H at 4.79 ppm. Let me think: that could be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom or in an environment that deshields the protons. If it's a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, like in a ketone, then the protons would be more upfield, maybe around 2.3 ppm, which is the region where the 10H multiplet is.

So 4.79 must be something else. How about an epoxide? The epoxide's CH2 would have H around 3-4.5 ppm, depending on substitution. So 4.79 is a bit high for an epoxide, but maybe it's a transannular epoxide or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is from an acetal or ketal group.

Wait, but product 1 is formed from KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane. KOH isn't typically used to form acetals; that's more for acid-catalyzed reactions.

Another approach: think about the number of signals in the NMR. Product 1 has three signals: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). So three sets of H. The 10H multiplet suggests multiple equivalent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that there are two equivalent CH2 groups at 2.41-2.23 and another at 1.94. The 4.79 could be a single CH2 group.

But I'm not getting much further. Maybe I should try to think about the ozonolysis part.

Assuming product 2 has a double bond, after ozonolysis, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3.

The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

So the most deshielded H would be near a carbonyl group. Maybe it's adjacent to a carbonyl, leading to a coupling with neighboring Hs.

Wait, in ozonolysis, if the double bond was between two identical groups, the resulting carbonyl groups would be symmetrical, and the Hs adjacent would have specific coupling patterns.

Alternatively, if the double bond was between two different groups, the ozonolysis would yield two different carbonyl compounds.

But perhaps the structure is such that the ozonolysis product has a conjugated diene, leading to a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, for example, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break each double bond into two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a monoene, which upon ozonolysis gives a diepoxide or similar. No, ozonolysis gives carbonyls.

Another thought: ozonolysis of a simple alkene (like RCH2CH2R') would give two carbonyl compounds, each with their own H environments.

Wait, but product 3's NMR is the focus. The most deshielded H would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group, so possibly in an alpha position.

In the ozonolysis product, the carbonyl group would cause deshielding for the adjacent Hs.

So, the most deshielded H is probably next to a carbonyl, perhaps in a CH2 group. The coupling pattern depends on neighboring Hs.

If the CH2 is next to a carbonyl, and adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, for example, if the structure is O=CH2-CH2-CO, then each H on the central CH2 would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded H is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group.

If the CH2 is next to a carbonyl and attached to another CH2, then each H on the central CH2 would couple with two sets of Hs: the ones on the same CH2 (if any, but they're equivalent) and the ones on the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R', then the central CH2 groups would each have Hs that are split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

But in reality, the ozonolysis of a single double bond would give two carbonyl groups connected via the broken double bond. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 is a monoene, perhaps a simple alkene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each with adjacent Hs.

For example, if product 2 is R-CH2-CH2-R', ozonolysis would yield R-CO and R'-CO. But that's for a single double bond. Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic compound with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into a diketone or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, and ozonolysis yields multiple carbonyl groups.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the coupling pattern in product 3 is due to vicinal coupling (J coupling between adjacent Hs) and perhaps geminal coupling (though geminal coupling is usually not observed because the Hs are equivalent and split into a singlet).

Alternatively, the most deshielded H might be part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and coupled with two neighboring CH2 groups on either side. So each H would be split by the neighboring Hs.

For example, let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-O. Then, the central CH2 would have Hs that are next to two other CH2 groups. Each H on the central CH2 would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups. If each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, then the central Hs would be a triplet for each neighbor, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the central CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, each with two Hs, the coupling would be more complex.

Wait, let's imagine the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. The central CH2 would be in the middle, with two adjacent CH2 groups. Each H on the central CH2 would couple with the Hs on each adjacent CH2. Each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, so each coupling would be a triplet. But since there are two adjacent sets, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, leading to a quintet? Or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, no. Let me think: each H on the central CH2 is next to two CH2 groups on either side. Each of those CH2 groups has two Hs. So the central H would be split by the Hs on the left and the Hs on the right.

Each side contributes a triplet. So for each side, the central H is a triplet. But since both sides are present, the splitting becomes a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of n+1 rule.

If a proton is split by two neighboring groups, each with n and m protons respectively, the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1) peaks.

In this case, if each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, n = 2 and m=2. So (2+1)*(2+1) =9 peaks. But that's a nonet, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and next to a CH group.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the products are typically carbonyls. So perhaps the structure is something like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, so the central CH2 is between two carbonyls. The Hs on the central CH2 would each be split by the adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but wait, in that case, the central CH2 would be between two carbonyls, like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. So each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group on each side. So each H is coupled with the two Hs on the left and the two Hs on the right.

But the left and right are symmetrical, so each H on the central CH2 would be split by four Hs in total, but since they're in two groups of two, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps each H is split by two neighboring Hs on either side. Each side contributes a triplet, so the overall splitting is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, if the H is coupled with two adjacent Hs on each side, but they're equivalent, perhaps it's a triplet.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH group, leading to coupling with both.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, which is next to another CH2 group. So the H would have two neighboring groups, each contributing two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets, but I'm not certain.

Looking at the options, the most plausible is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with KOH at 240°C.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The ¹H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41–2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 ppm peak suggests a CH₂ group in a deshielded environment, possibly adjacent to a carbonyl.  
   - Based on the IR and NMR data, product 1 is likely a diketone, where two ketone groups have formed due to elimination of two HBr molecules.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, a Lewis acid.  
   - This step likely facilitates the formation of a double bond (product 2), as product 2 undergoes ozonolysis in the next step.  
   - Product 2 is inferred to be an alkene, as ozonolysis targets double bonds.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing fragments (product 3).  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This hydrogen would couple with neighboring hydrogens, leading to a specific splitting pattern.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and coupled with hydrogens on neighboring groups.  
   - Each neighboring group contributes splitting, resulting in a triplet of triplets as the coupling pattern.

**Conclusion**: The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a triplet of triplets.
