Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, okay, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The goal is to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the precision of energy measurements to the time over which the measurement is made. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But sometimes it's approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt when considering the natural linewidth or the energy uncertainty due to the lifetime of the state.

So each energy level has a certain uncertainty in its energy measurement. The lifetime here is the time during which the state exists before it decays. So a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy, right? Because if the state doesn't last very long, we can't measure its energy very precisely. So the energy uncertainty ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime Δt.

The energy difference between the two levels needs to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly distinguishable. Otherwise, the energy levels might overlap, making it hard to tell them apart.

So let's compute the uncertainties for each state. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, maybe I should convert that into eV.

Wait, I think 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So let's see. The uncertainty principle equation is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

For state 1 with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 = ħ / (1e-9 s)
= (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s)
= 1.0545718e-25 J

Convert J to eV: 1 J = 1 / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.
So ΔE1 ≈ 1.0545718e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ (1.05e-25 * 6.24e18) eV
Calculating that: 1.05e-25 * 6.24e18 = (1.05 *6.24) * 1e-7 ≈ 6.55e-7 eV. Wait, wait, no, let's calculate exponents correctly.

1e-25 * 1e18 is 1e-7. So 1.05e-34 J·s divided by 1e-9 s gives 1.05e-25 J. Then converting to eV:

1.05e-25 J * (1 eV)/(1.602e-19 J) = (1.05e-25) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ approximately (1.05 / 1.602) * 1e-6 eV. 1.05 /1.602 is about 0.655, so 0.655e-6 eV which is 6.55e-7 eV.

Similarly for state 2 with Δt2=1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / (1e-8 s) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 J * (1 eV)/(1.602e-19 J) = (1.05e-26) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 0.655e-7 eV = 6.55e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 6.55e-7 eV and 6.55e-8 eV for the two states.

The energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties for them to be distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the sum, the lines might overlap and you can't tell them apart.

So the sum ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 = 6.55e-7 + 6.55e-8 = 6.55e-7 + 0.655e-7 = 7.205e-7 eV.

So the actual energy difference should be greater than about 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV, which is way less than 7e-7. So no.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller, no.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → that's 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way larger than 7e-7 eV. So this would be resolvable.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. That's 1e-8 eV, which is smaller than 7e-7 eV. So not enough.

So the only option that works is C) 1e-4 eV.

To determine the energy difference required for two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) to be clearly distinguishable, we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the energy uncertainty \( \Delta E \) to the lifetime \( \Delta t \) of the state as:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)), and the lifetimes of the two states are \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \). The energy uncertainties for each state are calculated as:

1. For \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. For \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.55 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

The total energy uncertainty is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.55 \times 10^{-7} + 6.55 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.205 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.205 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.205 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — This is \( 0.1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.205 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

The only option that satisfies the condition is **C**.
