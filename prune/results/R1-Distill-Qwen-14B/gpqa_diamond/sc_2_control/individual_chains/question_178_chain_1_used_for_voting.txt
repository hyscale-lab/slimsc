Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν]. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, mass dimension calculations. Right, in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 (since the Lagrangian density has dimensions of mass^4 in 4 spacetime dimensions). So, I need to find the dimensions of each part of the term and then solve for κ.

Let me break down each part. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{μν}.

First, I should recall the dimensions of the fields and the coupling constants. Fermions, like ψ, have a mass dimension of 3/2. Because for the Dirac equation, the term i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must have the same dimension as the mass term m ψ. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so ∂_μ acting on ψ gives dimension 1 + 3/2 = 5/2. The mass term m ψ must have dimension 3/2 + 0 (since m is dimension 1), wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, in general, fields have dimensions based on the equations of motion. For a fermion, the kinetic term is something like ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4 (since Lagrangian is dimension 4). So each part of that term must be dimension 4.

So ψ̄ has dimension (3/2) because ψ is (3/2) and ψ̄ is the same. Then, i γ^μ ∂_μ has dimension 1 (since ∂ has dimension 1). So the product ψ̄ (∂) ψ must be 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4, which is correct. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, the field F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, right? Because F is antisymmetric and has derivatives of A. The photon field A_mu has dimension 1. Because the Maxwell term is F^2, which is (∂ A)^2. So ∂ A has dimension 1 +1=2, so F has dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. The Maxwell Lagrangian is (F_{μν})^2. F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each F has dimension (∂ A) which is (1 + 1) = 2. So F itself has dimension 2.

So the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, so each part:

- ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.
- σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless because gamma matrices are just constants (they don't carry dimensions).
Wait, but σ is made of gamma matrices; since γ matrices are dimensionless, σ is also dimensionless.

So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) * (dimensionless) * (3/2) = 3/2 +3/2 = 3.

Then F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by (3) multiplied by (2). So κ * 3*2 must have dimension 4, because the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4.

Wait, no. The entire term is a product of these terms. So let me sum their dimensions. So each part's dimensions are:

κ: let's call this [κ]_M = x (unknown, what we're solving for).

ψ̄: 3/2.

σ_{mu nu}: 0, because it's made of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless.

ψ: 3/2.

F: 2.

Multiply all together: x (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) = 4.

So x + (3/2 + 3/2 + 2) =4.

Wait, no. Because each field contributes their dimension. So the term is:

κ * ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ̄ is 3/2, each ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product of the fields is (3/2)^2 * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2.

Wait, more precisely, the product is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4)*2 = 9/2.

So the term κ multiplied by (9/2) must have dimension 4, because the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So:

[κ]_M + 9/2 =4 → [κ]_M =4 -9/2 = (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2?

Wait, wait, that can't be right because the options don't have -1/2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the F term. Let me double-check.

Wait, the term is F^{mu nu}, which is a field strength tensor. The field strength tensor F is made from two derivatives, right? Because F_{mu nu} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. So each F has dimension [∂][A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{mu nu} is dimension 2.

So in the term, the F has dimension 2. So in the term ψ̄ σ ψ F, the total is 3/2 * 3/2 * 2 = (9/4)*2= 9/2.

So the term is κ multiplied by (9/2). The dimension of the entire term must be 4.

So [κ] + 9/2 =4 → [κ] = 4 - 9/2= (8/2 -9/2)= -1/2. Wait, but that's -0.5, but the options are in integers. So this can't be right. Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the F term is dimension 1? No, that doesn't make sense. Because F is made of derivatives of A. A has dimension 1, so F would have dimension 2.

Wait, maybe the sigma term is contributing something else? But σ is made of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So the σ doesn't add any dimensions. Hmm.

Wait, let me recalculate. The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2 and ψ is 3/2. So together, ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2 +3/2) =3. Then F is 2, so ψ̄ σ ψ F is 3 +2 =5? Or am I adding them?

Wait, no, the dimensions are multiplicative, not additive. So each field contributes by multiplication. So:

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4, because σ is dimensionless. Then F is 2, so the term is 9/4 * 2 = 9/2.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by (9/2), and the dimension of the term must be 4. So [κ] + 9/2 =4 → [κ] =4 -9/2 = (8/2 -9/2) = -1/2. So [κ] is -1/2.

But wait, the options given are -1 and 1. Hmm, so none of the options match this. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the F dimension. Let me think again.

Wait, the field strength tensor F in non-Abelian theories might have a different dimension, but here it's an Abelian case (like electromagnetism), so F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the term is F^{mu nu}, which is a field strength, and in 4D spacetime, the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must be dimension 4.

Another approach: each term in the Lagrangian L is dimension 4. The given term is an interaction term, so it's part of the Lagrangian, so its dimension is 4.

So, L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu} must have dimension 4.

So let's compute the dimension of each part:

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2.

ψ has dimension 3/2.

σ_{mu nu} is made of gammas, so dimensionless.

F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

So putting it all together:

κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) = κ * (9/4 * 2) = κ * (9/2).

Wait, but wait, sigma_{mu nu} is dimensionless, so it doesn't contribute. So the term is κ times (ψ̄ σ ψ) times F.

The dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + (3/2) + (3/2) + 2.

So that adds up to [κ] + (3 + 2) = [κ] +5 =4. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1.

Ah, wait, I think I was mixing additive and multiplicative approaches earlier. Let me clarify.

Each term in the Lagrangian has to have the same dimension as the Lagrangian, which is 4 (in 4D spacetime). Each part contributes their dimension, which are additive because the terms are multiplied together in the Lagrangian. So for the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, the dimensions would be:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] because σ is dimensionless.

Wait, but wait, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So it's ψ̄ (3/2), ψ (3/2), and F (2). So the sum is 3/2 + 3/2 +2 = 3 + 2 =5. So 5 + [κ] must equal 4, so [κ] = -1.

Oh, that makes sense! So [κ] is -1.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on the coupling's dimension. Couplings with positive mass dimension (or zero) are renormalizable, while negative dimensions imply non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait, the rule is that the coupling must have a dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). For a term to be renormalizable, the dimension of the coupling must be ≥ 0.

So for the interaction term, κ has dimension [κ] = -1. Which is negative. Therefore, the interaction is non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait, another way: in general, an interaction term L_int = g φ_1 φ_2 ... φ_n, the dimension of the coupling g is [g] = 4 - (d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_n), where d_i are the dimensions of each field.

In this case, the term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the number of fields: ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So total fields' dimensions: 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 5. So [κ] =4 -5 = -1, which is what we have.

Now, for renormalizability, the coupling must have mass dimension ≥ 0. Because in a renormalizable theory, the coupling's dimension is zero or positive.

Since [κ] is -1, which is negative, the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

Option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. So option C is correct.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has a mass dimension of $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ (e.g., for electromagnetism) has a mass dimension of $2$, as it is constructed from derivatives of the gauge field $A_\mu$ ($A_\mu$ has dimension $1$).
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is constructed from $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless, so $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is also dimensionless.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density must have a total mass dimension of $4$ in four spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes the following:
- $\bar{\psi}$ has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\psi$ has dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ has dimension $2$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

The total dimension of the fields is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Let the mass dimension of $\kappa$ be $[\kappa]_M$. Since the entire term must have dimension $4$, we solve:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability
A theory is renormalizable if the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative, the interaction term is non-renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. 

**Option C** matches these conclusions.
