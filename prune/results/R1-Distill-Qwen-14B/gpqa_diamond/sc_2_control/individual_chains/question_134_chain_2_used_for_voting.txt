Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. The solutions given are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic, which means the answer should be negative, probably in kilojoules or kilocalories.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out the moles of each acid and base because the reaction will depend on their mole ratios. I've heard that HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. 

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, meaning it can donate two protons. So each mole of H2SO4 would contribute 2 moles of H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and each mole gives 2 OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So the reactions would be between the acids and the base. Let's break it down.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each substance.

For HCl:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M.
Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives 1 H+.

For H2SO4:
Volume 300 mL = 0.3 L, Molarity 0.3 M.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. As diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+, so that's 0.18 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Volume 200 mL = 0.2 L, Molarity 0.5 M.
Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Since each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, that's 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. Oh, no. The OH- is from the base, and the H+ comes from both acids. So the total H+ is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles of H+.

The OH- is 0.2 moles. So when they react, H+ and OH- will neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So the reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the limiting reagent here is the OH- because 0.28 H+ vs 0.2 OH-. Oh wait, no. Wait, if H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2, then the OH- will be the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+ to form water. Then, there will be 0.08 moles of H+ left over.

Wait, but wait again. Because H2SO4 is diprotic, but in the initial step, do both protons react? Or do I consider the neutralization step by step? I think in this scenario, the first H+ from H2SO4 would react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and then perhaps any remaining H+ would come from both HCl and the second H+ of H2SO4.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess. Let me think.

Total H+ available: 0.1 (HCl) + 0.09 * 2 (H2SO4) = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- available: 0.1 * 2 (Ba(OH)2) = 0.2 moles.

So the reaction between H+ and OH- will use up all the OH- (0.2 moles) and 0.2 moles of H+. So the remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

Wait, but that's not considering where the H+ comes from. So the first 0.2 moles of H+ would come from HCl and H2SO4. Let me think: HCl is 0.1 H+, and H2SO4 is 0.18 H+. So if I take 0.2 moles H+ from the total 0.28, that would use up all of the HCl (0.1) and 0.09 from H2SO4 (since 0.1 + 0.09 = 0.19, which is less than 0.2), but wait, I'm not sure if that's the right way. Maybe I should just go with the total H+ and OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2 moles. It will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So the total enthalpy change is based on the moles of H+ neutralized. Each mole of H+ neutralized releases about 57 kJ (since the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is around 57 kJ per mole, but I think the value might vary, but the problem might consider it as 57 kJ/mol).

Wait, but wait. The options are in kcal and kJ. I need to be consistent with units. Oh, wait the options have A, B, C in kcal and D in kJ. So perhaps the question expects me to use a specific value for enthalpy per mole.

Alternatively, I've heard that the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since it's exothermic). But sometimes, it's given as -57.3 kJ/mol for H+.

But the problem gives the options in kcal and kJ. Let me think: 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. But not exactly, so perhaps the question uses a rounded value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to calculate using the exact moles and a given enthalpy per mole.

So, back to the neutralization. The OH- is 0.2 moles, so it will neutralize 0.2 moles of H+.

So the total enthalpy released would be 0.2 moles * 57 kJ/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. Since it's exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative, so ΔH = -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not close. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Wait, maybe I got the approach wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the moles of each acid and base and see which is in excess.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach it as a titration problem, considering each acid's ability to donate H+ and the base's ability to donate OH-.

So, let me break it down:

Moles of HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol. HCl → H+ + Cl-.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ available: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- available: 0.2 mol.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the limiting reagent is OH-, which is 0.2 mol. So all OH- will react, neutralizing 0.2 mol of H+.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 mol * enthalpy per mole.

Assuming the standard enthalpy of neutralization is -57 kJ/mol (for H+), then 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options: option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but -11.4 kJ is about -2.7 kJ when converted to kcal (since 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ). Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting the units mixed up. Wait a second, 1 kJ is 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is approximately 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that would be the answer if I'm correct.

Wait, but why is option D -16.0 kJ? That would be if more moles were involved. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me double-check the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L, 0.2 M → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L, 0.3 M → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L, 0.5 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-. Correct.

So moles of OH- is 0.2, and moles of H+ is 0.28. So 0.2 mol OH- neutralizes 0.2 mol H+.

So the enthalpy is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Since it's exothermic, it's -11.4 kJ. But that's not one of the options except for option D which is -16 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I got the H+ from H2SO4 wrong. Wait, wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in solution, the first H+ is completely ionized, and the second one is only partially ionized, but in the case of a strong acid, it would be fully ionized. So in this problem, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so both H+ would dissociate. So the 0.09 mol H2SO4 would give 0.18 mol H+.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. So for HCl, which is monoprotic, each mole produces 1 H+. For H2SO4, each mole produces 2 H+, so for neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 would require 2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but in that case, maybe I should look at the stoichiometry in terms of the acid and base neutralizing each other.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider each acid separately.

Let me think: first, the HCl reacts with OH-.

Moles of HCl: 0.1 mol.

Moles of OH-: 0.2 mol.

HCl is a strong acid, so it donates 0.1 mol H+.

OH- is 0.2 mol, which can neutralize 0.1 mol H+ from HCl, leaving 0.1 mol OH-.

Then, the H2SO4 donates 0.18 mol H+. These would react with the remaining 0.1 mol OH-.

So after HCl reacts, 0.1 mol OH- remains, which will neutralize 0.1 mol of H+ from H2SO4.

So that uses up 0.1 mol of H+ from H2SO4, leaving 0.08 mol H+ unreacted.

Wait, but then the total moles neutralized would be 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2 mol H+.

Which brings us back to the same total of 0.2 mol H+ neutralized.

So whether I do it step by step or overall, the result is the same.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong enthalpy value. Maybe the enthalpy per mole is different. Or perhaps I should calculate it as 57.3 kcal/mol instead of kJ. Let me check.

Wait, 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4184 J, which is 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is about 13.68 kcal.

Wait, but earlier I thought 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. So 0.2 moles would give 2.72 kcal (0.2 * 13.68 ≈ 2.736). So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

But wait, why is option D -16 kJ? That would be if 0.28 moles were neutralized. But that can't be because OH- is only 0.2 moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Oh! Because Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- per formula unit, but perhaps the enthalpy calculation is per mole of Ba(OH)2, not per mole of OH-.

Wait, no, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting, not per mole of acid or base.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the neutralization is considered per mole of base, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of H+ is 57 kcal. Let me think: 57 kcal per mole is about 238 kJ, which is way too high. So that's probably not it.

Wait, wait, perhaps the problem is in the units of the options. Let me look at them again.

Options:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, so option D is in kJ, others in kcal. So perhaps the problem expects me to compute in kcal.

Wait, another approach: 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized, each at 57.3 kcal/mol.

So 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -11.46 kcal, which is approximately option B (-11.42 kcal). But earlier, when I computed 0.2 moles of H+ at 57 kJ, that was 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

Wait, this is confusing. Now I'm getting conflicting results based on whether I use kJ or kcal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value. Let me think: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is 57.3 kJ/mol (about 13.68 kcal). So per mole of H+, it's 57.3 kJ.

So 0.2 moles would give 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ.

So if the problem expects the answer in kJ, then 11.46 kJ is about 11.5, but none of the options match exactly except option B is in kcal: -11.42 kcal. That's very close to 11.46 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, let me compute 11.4 kJ → kcal. 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal. So 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So -11.4 kJ is approximately -2.72 kcal. So that matches option A.

Hmm, but why does option B present the same number in kcal? Wait, -11.42 kcal would correspond to 11.42 kcal, which is approximately 49.1 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 47.77 kJ). Which doesn't match our 11.4 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe the problem is not about H+ but about the acid-base reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is different. Let me think about the reaction:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for the acid and base, but considering the H+ and OH-.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is:

H2SO4 (strong acid) + Ba(OH)2 (strong base) → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O.

The reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + SO4^2- + 2 H2O.

In terms of H+ and OH-:

H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-
Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-

So the reaction would combine the H+ and OH-:

H+ + OH- → H2O (times 2 for H2SO4).

So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles of H+ are neutralized by 2 moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the moles of H+ from H2SO4 (0.09 mol) → 0.18 mol H+.

The moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ and OH- would react in a 1:1 ratio.

So the OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28, so OH- is the limiting reagent, as before.

So the total H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → which is about 2.72 kcal.

So the answer would be option A) -2.72 kcal.

But why is there an option D) -16.0 kJ? That's four times bigger. Maybe I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2 mol, H+ is 0.28 mol.

So 0.2 mol H+ neutralized → 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

But in the options, the closest is option D at -16 kJ. Hmm, that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total enthalpy considering all possible reactions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the enthalpy change for each acid-base pair and sum them.

So, for HCl reacting with Ba(OH)2:

Each mole of HCl gives 1 H+, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

But perhaps each mole of HCl would neutralize 1 mole of Ba(OH)2's OH-.

Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, think about each acid (HCl and H2SO4) reacting with the base (Ba(OH)2).

The neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So regardless of the source, each H+ reacts with an OH-.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts, and 0.08 H+ remains.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

So option A is the correct answer.

But why is option D there? Did I miss something in the stoichiometry?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the reaction in terms of the acid and base, not just the H+ and OH-.

Wait, another approach: calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ total: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28.

OH- total: 0.2.

So the reaction will use 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

The excess H+ is 0.08, so the solution will be acidic, but that's not directly relevant.

The enthalpy released is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

But looking back at the options, the closest is option D: -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the problem expects to use 57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed, which is the same as per mole of H+.

Wait, 0.2 moles of H2O would be 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

But the option that's close in kcal is option A: -2.72 kcal, which is approximately 11.46 kJ.

Alternatively, the question is in kcal. 11.46 kJ is about 2.74 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option A, -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of each substance:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles.  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, it contributes 0.1 moles of H⁺.
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles.  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, it contributes 0.18 moles of H⁺.
   - **Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles.  
     Since each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, it contributes 0.2 moles of OH⁻.

2. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - Total H⁺ available = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H₂SO₄) = 0.28 moles.  
   - Total OH⁻ available = 0.2 moles.  
   - The reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻ occurs in a 1:1 molar ratio. Since OH⁻ is present in fewer moles (0.2 moles), it is the limiting reagent. Thus, 0.2 moles of H⁺ will react with 0.2 moles of OH⁻ to form water.

3. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids is approximately **-57.3 kJ/mol** (or **-13.68 kcal/mol**) per mole of H⁺ neutralized.  
   - Since 0.2 moles of H⁺ are neutralized, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]  
     Converting to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times \frac{1 \, \text{kcal}}{4.184 \, \text{kJ}} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

4. **Match the result with the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change of **-2.72 kcal** matches **option A**.  
   - Other options, such as **-16.0 kJ** (option D), do not align with the calculated value.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
