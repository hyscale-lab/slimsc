Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration and pH calculations can be tricky. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So the problem: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when we titrate them, they'll neutralize each other to form acetate ions and water.

First, I think I need to find the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. Oh wait, yes, because diluting with water reduces the concentration.

So the initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, which is 0.020 L. The molarity is 0.05 M. So moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume in liters. That's 0.05 mol/L * 0.020 L = 0.001 mol.

Then, we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.040 L. So the new concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.040 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's right. Wait, 20 cm³ + 20 cm³ is 40 cm³, yes. So 0.020 L each. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So let's compute the moles at equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol because the reaction is 1:1 (CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O).

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.010 L, which is 10 cm³. Oh, wait, but the question is asking about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, for the pH at 25% titration, we can't just rely on the initial calculation. We need to find out how much of the acetic acid has reacted and how much is left, plus the amount of acetate ion formed.

Alternatively, maybe using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be easier. Because for a buffer solution, which is what we have before the equivalence point, the pH can be calculated using pKa and the ratio of concentrations.

Wait, let's think about the equivalence point first. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate (a salt of a weak acid, so the solution will be basic). The pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

So, for the equivalence point:

The acetate ion, CH3COO⁻, is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So in solution, it will react with water:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let's compute it accurately: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence point: Well, the total volume is the initial volume plus the volume of NaOH added. So initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.040 L). The equivalence volume is 10 cm³ (0.010 L). So total volume is 50 cm³ (0.050 L). Moles of acetate is 0.001 mol. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M.

So [CH3COO⁻] = 0.02 M.

Now, using Kb: Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH⁻ produced:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since x will be very small.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

Taking square root: x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH⁻] ≈ 3.29e-6 M. So pOH is -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.49.

Then pH = 14 - 5.49 ≈ 8.51. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A says 4.26;8.52. So perhaps the equivalence pH is 8.52, but let's see.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recheck:

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/1.85e-5) = 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, and 1.85 is a bit higher, so pKa is about 4.73, which is correct). So alternatively, the pH at equivalence point for a weak acid titrated with strong base is determined by the Kb of the conjugate base. So the calculation I did should be correct.

So equivalence pH is approx 8.51, which is close to option A's 8.52. But let me check the other part— the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, which is 0.0025 L.

The moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So, since the reaction is 1:1, moles of acetic acid reacted is 0.00025 mol. So initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol, so remaining is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

The total volume now is original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Using Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

pKa is 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → what's the ratio?

0.005882/0.017647 ≈ 0.3333 (since 5.882 is 1/3 of 17.646 approximately). So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So about 4.25. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 and 8.52. That would match.

Wait, but option D has pH 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculations. Let's double-check the concentrations.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH added are 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So the acid reacts with this, so:

moles CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

moles CH3COO⁻ = 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Ratio [A⁻]/[HA] = (0.005882) / (0.017647) ≈ 0.333 → same as before.

So pH = 4.73 + log(0.333) = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Rounded to 4.25, but option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is 8.51, which is close to 8.52. So option A's pH at equivalence is 8.52, and 25% is 4.26.

But wait, what about other options? Let's see. Option D has pH 4.57 and 6.92, but I don't think that would fit. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the solution after dilution but before titration.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the initial pH after dilution.

Wait, the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid. So the pH can be approximated, but perhaps it's not needed here because the question is about during titration.

Wait, but the 25% titration isn't the same as 25% of the initial solution. Let me think again about the 25% titration.

Wait, 25% of the equivalence point volume. So the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using exact concentrations considering the dilution and titration.

Wait, another thing to consider: after adding NaOH, the solution has both acetic acid and acetate ions. So it's a buffer solution. Thus, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is appropriate.

But let me think if I did the calculations correctly. So I think I did it correctly.

Wait, but wait, at equivalence point, the solution is 0.02 M acetate. Kb is 5.405e-10, so the calculation for [OH-] is √(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6. So pOH is log(3.29e-6)=5.49, so pH is 8.51. So the option A's 8.52 is close.

So the 25% titration pH is approx 4.25, which is option A's 4.26. So the correct answer would be A.

But looking at the options, option D says 4.57; 6.92. Could I have made a mistake in the ratio?

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the exact concentrations.

Wait, initial volume after dilution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). Adding 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of NaOH, so total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

Moles of CH3COOH = initial moles - moles reacted, which is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO⁻ = 0.00025 mol.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO⁻] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

The ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333.

So pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → pKa is 4.73.

Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 → pH ≈4.25.

Which is close to option A's 4.26.

At equivalence point, pH is about 8.51, which is about 8.52 in option A.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the equivalence point calculation. Because sometimes, the acetate concentration might not just be moles/volume, but wait, no, that's correct. Because all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so moles of acetate is same as moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001. Then, the total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's correct.

Wait, but wait, another approach: maybe using the exact method for the equivalence point solution.

So for the acetate ion:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

Initial concentration: 0.02 M.

Change: -x , +x, +x.

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 → [OH⁻] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = 5.49 → pH = 8.51. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that at 25% titration, the amount of base added is 25% of the required volume, thus the same as the 25% in moles.

Hmm, but I think I did all steps correctly. So the pH at 25% is approx 4.25 and at equivalence it's 8.51. So the correct option is A: 4.26;8.52.

But looking at the options, option D has pH 4.57 and 6.92, which doesn't fit. So I think option A is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, giving moles of acetic acid as:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.020 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L) of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetic acid}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.040} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At the Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to form acetate ions. The moles of NaOH required to reach the equivalence point are equal to the moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. The volume of 0.1 M NaOH needed is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, the total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetate} = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), which is related to the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \) by:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \), we solve for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(3.29 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.49.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.49 = 8.51.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH added} = 0.25 \times 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0025 \, \text{L}.
\]

The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of acetic acid remaining are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.0059 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log{\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right)},
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.73 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log{\left(\frac{0.0059}{0.0176}\right)} = 4.73 + \log{(0.333)}.
\]

\[
\log{(0.333)} \approx -0.477.
\]

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
