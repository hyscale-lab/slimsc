Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? Its radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So, the spots are at 5000 K?

The scenario is that because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view as it spins. This would cause periodic changes in brightness when observed from Earth. But the interesting part is that this situation can look similar to the presence of an exoplanet causing a dip in brightness when it transits the star. So the question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as this spotted star, if the star didn't have any spots.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says, if the star was not covered by spots, what radius exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star does. So the problem is about comparing the photometric variations caused by the star's spots to those caused by a planet.

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's effect on the star's light is the same as the spots' effect.

I remember that the dip in brightness when a planet transits a star is calculated by the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the brightness change is the area blocked.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the brightness changes because the spots are darker than the surrounding. So when the spots are on the visible side, the star appears a bit dimmer.

So the star's brightness variation due to the spots is due to the spots being cooler. So the question is: what's the change in brightness when the spots rotate in and out of view, and how does that compare to the change caused by a planet blocking the star's light.

Let me break it down.

First, the star's light without spots: the flux is uniform. But when the spots are visible, their lower flux causes a dip in the total observed flux.

The star has a radius Rstar = Sun's radius. Let's say Rstar = R_sun for simplicity.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So, let's think about the area. A hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's surface. Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the hemisphere is 2π R², the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

But wait, the star is a sphere. So when we look at the star, the hemisphere that's facing us is half of the star's surface. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 0.2 of that, so 0.4π R² total.

Each spot has a temperature of 5000 K, and the rest of the star is at 6000 K. So the flux from the spots is lower. When the star rotates and the spots come into view, the total flux we receive will decrease because that area is emitting less.

The total flux from the star when the spots are facing us would be the sum of the flux from the non-spots and the spots.

The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4.

So normally, the star emits F0 = σ (6000)^4 per unit area.

The spots emit Fs = σ (5000)^4 per unit area.

The area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

The area of the star's disk as seen from Earth is π R² (since we see a hemisphere, but wait, no. The area is π R² because when you observe a sphere, the area is π R² (like a circle with radius R). Wait, no: the area of a spherical cap is 2π R h, but for a full hemisphere, h = R, so area is 2π R². But when you are looking at the star, the area you see is π R², not 2π R² because the star is a sphere, so the projected area is π R². Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The star's surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². But when you're observing the star, you see a disk of area π R². So the hemisphere that is facing us is π R², not 2π R². Wait, no. The surface area of the star is 4π R². The area that is facing us is a hemisphere, which is 2π R². But when we observe the star, we see a circle with radius R, so the area is π R²? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the star's disk as seen from Earth. The area is π R². So when a spot is on the star's surface, it covers a fraction of that area.

Wait, but in the problem, it says that one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the area of the spots as seen from Earth is 20% of a hemisphere.

Wait, the hemisphere that is facing us. So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R², right? Because the entire surface area is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But when the star rotates, the spots that are on the other hemisphere will come into view. Wait, no. The problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. So as the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, and then the other hemisphere, which may not have spots.

Wait, no. No, the description says the star has one hemisphere covered in spots. So imagine the star is like a sphere, and one half (hemisphere) has spots covering 20% of that. So when the star is viewed, the spots are in the visible hemisphere, and as the star rotates, the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, perhaps the star is rotating such that the spots come into and out of the field of view. So the maximum effect would be when the spots are fully visible, and the minimum when the other hemisphere (with no spots) is visible.

Wait, but the star's brightness when the spots are visible would be lower than when the spots are on the far side. So the total flux when the spots are visible would be F = F0*(1 - f) + Fs*f, where f is the filling factor.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the change in flux when the spots are visible.

The star's total flux without spots: F0 = σ T^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ), but wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the area.

Wait, the star has a surface area of 4π R². The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere, which is 0.2*(2π R²) = 0.4π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4π R².

Wait, no, because each spot is a certain size on the surface. But the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, so 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered.

So the area of the hemisphere is 2π R², so the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux from the star is:

F = (Area without spots) * F_normal + (Area with spots) * F_spots.

Where F_normal is σ (6000)^4, and F_spots is σ (5000)^4.

So the area without spots is (2π R² - 0.4π R²) = 1.6π R².

The area with spots is 0.4π R².

So the total flux when the spots are visible is:

F_visible = (1.6π R² * σ 6000^4) + (0.4π R² * σ 5000^4).

The total flux when the spots are not visible (other hemisphere) is F0 = 2π R² * σ 6000^4.

Wait, no. Because when the spotty hemisphere is not visible, the other hemisphere is all normal. The other hemisphere has no spots, so F0 is 2π R² * σ 6000^4.

So the change in flux when the star is in the spotty position is ΔF = F_visible - F0.

Wait, no: when the spots are visible, the flux is F_visible. When the spots are on the far side, the flux is F0. So the observed flux varies between F_visible and F0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation would be (F0 - F_visible) / F0.

Wait, because F_visible is lower than F0.

So let me compute F_visible.

F_visible = (1.6π R² * 6000^4 σ) + (0.4π R² * 5000^4 σ)

Factor out π R² σ:

F_visible = π R² σ [1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 ]

F0 (when spots are not visible) is:

F0 = 2π R² σ (6000^4 )

So the ratio F_visible / F0 is [1.6*6000^4 +0.4*5000^4 ] / (2 * 6000^4 )

Let me compute the numerator:

1.6 * 6000^4 = 1.6 * (6^4) * 1e9 (since 1e3)^4=1e12, but maybe it's easier to compute as ratios.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out 6000^4.

Let me compute the ratio inside the brackets:

Let x = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = (625)/(1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So the numerator is 1.6 * (6000^4) + 0.4 * (5000^4) = (6000^4)(1.6 + 0.4 * x )

Similarly, denominator is 2 * 6000^4.

So the ratio F_visible / F0 is [1.6 + 0.4*(5/6)^4 ] / 2.

Compute 5/6 is approximately 0.833333. (5/6)^4 is approx (0.8333)^4.

Let me calculate 0.8333^2 = 0.6944, then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So x ≈0.4823.

So 0.4 * x = 0.4 * 0.4823 = 0.1929.

So 1.6 + 0.1929 = 1.7929.

Divide by 2: 1.7929 / 2 = 0.89645.

So F_visible = F0 * 0.89645.

So the flux when the spots are visible is approximately 89.645% of F0.

So the difference in flux is F0 - F_visible = F0 (1 - 0.89645) = F0 * 0.10355.

So the change in flux is about 10.355% of F0.

Wait, but the star's brightness variation is this difference. So the amplitude is about 10.355% of F0.

Now, if instead, an exoplanet were transiting the star, the change in flux would be the area of the planet over the area of the star.

The area blocked is (R_p / R_star)^2 * π R_star^2 / π R_star^2 = (R_p / R_star)^2.

Wait, no. The star's area is π R_star^2, and the planet's area is π R_p^2.

So the fractional decrease in flux is (π R_p^2 ) / (π R_star^2 ) = (R_p / R_star)^2.

So for the planet, the fractional change is (R_p / R_star)^2.

In this problem, the spotted star produces a fractional change of about 10.355% (or 0.10355) F0.

We need to set the planet's (R_p / R_star)^2 equal to this value.

So (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking square roots, R_p / R_star ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, earlier when I computed the ratio F_visible / F0, I got approximately 0.89645, so the flux when spots are visible is 89.645% of F0 when spots are not visible.

Wait, no, wait. F_visible is when the spots are visible. F0 is when the spotless hemisphere is visible.

No, wait, F0 is when the spots are on the far side, so the flux is 2π R² * 6000^4 σ / (4π R² / (4π D²)) )? No, perhaps I'm complicating.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio more carefully.

Wait, no, F0 is the flux when the spots are not visible (the other hemisphere is spotless). So F0 is 2π R² * F_normal, where F_normal is σ (6000)^4.

F_visible when the spotty hemisphere is visible is 1.6π R² * F_normal + 0.4 π R² * F_spots.

So the ratio F_visible / F0 is [1.6 F_normal + 0.4 F_spots ] / (2 F_normal )

= [1.6 + 0.4 (F_spots/F_normal) ] / 2.

F_spots/F_normal = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So 0.4 * 0.482253 ≈ 0.1929.

1.6 + 0.1929 = 1.7929.

Divide by 2: 0.89645.

So F_visible is 0.89645 * F0.

So the difference F0 - F_visible is F0 (1 - 0.89645) = F0 * 0.10355.

So the amplitude (the change in brightness) is about 10.355% of F0.

So the planet's transit would cause a dip of the same amplitude.

The planet's dip is (R_p / R_star )^2.

So (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.10355.

Take square root: sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

So approximately 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the answer should be D.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the photometric changes caused by the star's dark spots and compare them to the transit of an exoplanet.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots.
   - Temperature of the spots: \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The total flux from the star depends on the temperature of the regions emitting light. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the flux from a blackbody is proportional to \( T^4 \).
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux is the sum of flux from the unspotted regions (\( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) and the spotted regions (\( T = 5000 \, \text{K} \)).
   - The area of the star's surface is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the visible hemisphere has an area of \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere, so the area of the spots is \( 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).

3. **Flux When Spots Are Visible**:
   - The flux from the unspotted regions: \( F_{\text{normal}} = \sigma (6000)^4 \).
   - The flux from the spotted regions: \( F_{\text{spots}} = \sigma (5000)^4 \).
   - The total flux when the spots are visible:
     \[
     F_{\text{visible}} = (1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot F_{\text{normal}}) + (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot F_{\text{spots}})
     \]
     Factoring out \( \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \), we get:
     \[
     F_{\text{visible}} = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 1.6 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4 \right]
     \]

4. **Flux When Spots Are Not Visible**:
   - When the other hemisphere (spotless) is visible, the flux is:
     \[
     F_0 = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \cdot F_{\text{normal}}
     \]

5. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference in flux:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_0 - F_{\text{visible}}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for \( F_0 \) and \( F_{\text{visible}} \), the ratio \( F_{\text{visible}} / F_0 \) is:
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{visible}}}{F_0} = \frac{1.6 \cdot (6000)^4 + 0.4 \cdot (5000)^4}{2 \cdot (6000)^4}
     \]
   - Let \( x = (5000 / 6000)^4 \approx 0.4823 \). Then:
     \[
     \frac{F_{\text{visible}}}{F_0} = \frac{1.6 + 0.4 \cdot x}{2} = \frac{1.6 + 0.4 \cdot 0.4823}{2} = \frac{1.7929}{2} \approx 0.89645
     \]
   - The flux when the spots are visible is approximately 89.645% of \( F_0 \). The brightness variation is:
     \[
     \Delta F / F_0 = 1 - 0.89645 = 0.10355 \, (10.355\%)
     \]

6. **Comparison to Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The fractional brightness change caused by a transiting exoplanet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = \Delta F / F_0 = 0.10355
     \]
   - Solving for \( R_{\text{pl}} / R_{\text{star}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \).
