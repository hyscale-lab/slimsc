Okay, so I have this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, which have the same mass but different orbital periods and host stars.

Wait, so both are Earth-like, detected via the RV method. RV gives us the minimum mass, right, but since they're Earth-like, maybe we can assume their masses are the same. So same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 is shorter, meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star because the orbital period is shorter.

Also, both have circular orbits. The stars: Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radius. So same radius, but different masses.

The question is which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Because transiting depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to align edge-on.

I remember that the probability depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, more specifically, the probability is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbit. Wait, no, the other way around. Wait, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how is that influenced by other factors?

I think the probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. Because the planet has to be in the right orientation for the transit to happen, and the probability is proportional to the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance. So a planet that is closer (smaller a) would have a higher probability because the star's size is a larger fraction of the orbit's distance.

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability P is roughly (R_star / a) * (something else), but I think the main factor is R_star divided by the semi-major axis. So P ∝ R_star / a.

But wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another approach: the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit, multiplied by some factor involving the inclination distribution. Oh wait, I think the geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet)/ (a * (1 - e²)^0.5 ), but since both are circular, e=0, so it's (R_star)/(a). Also, but because the RV method can tell us the inclination, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Wait, but in reality, the RV method gives us the minimum mass because it's sensitive to the velocity along our line of sight. So it only tells us sin(i) * m, but for the purpose of transit probability, the inclination i is important. But in this question, both planets have already been detected via RV, which implies that their masses are known, but the RV method doesn't necessarily tell us the inclination. So the inclination distribution plays a role in the probability of transit.

Wait, but the question is about the probability that a transit occurs given the planet's orbit. So it's about the likelihood that, given a random inclination, the planet will transit. The RV method can give us the minimum mass, so we know that the true mass is at least as much as the minimum mass, but for this question, the masses are the same, so that's not an issue.

So the probability of transit depends on the star's radius and the semi-major axis (distance) of the planet's orbit. The closer the planet is to its star (smaller a), the higher the probability. Also, the larger the star, the higher the probability.

So for each planet, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a). So let's compute this for both.

Given:

- Planet_1's host star has mass M1 = 2 * M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host star. Both stars have the same radius, R. So R1 = R2 = R.

- Orbital periods: P1 = P2 / 3. So P1 is shorter.

We can use Kepler's third law to relate the period and the semi-major axis. The law is P² = (4π²/G(M + m)) * a³. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M + m ≈ M.

So P² ∝ a³ / M. So a³ = (G(M + m) P²)/(4π²) ≈ (G M P²)/(4π²).

So a ∝ (M P²)^(1/3). Or a = k * (M^(1/3) * P^(2/3)) ), where k is some constant.

Let's compute a1 (semi-major axis for Planet_1) and a2 (for Planet_2).

Given that P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1 = k * (M1^(1/3) * (P1)^(2/3) )

= k * ( (2 M2)^(1/3) * ( (1/3) P2 )^(2/3) )

= k * [ 2^(1/3) M2^(1/3) * (P2^(2/3)) / 3^(2/3) ) ]

= k * M2^(1/3) P2^(2/3) * [ 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ) ]

Similarly, a2 = k * (M2^(1/3) * P2^(2/3) )

So a1 = a2 * [ (2^(1/3)) / 3^(2/3) ) ].

Compute that factor: 2^(1/3) is cube root of 2, approx 1.26. 3^(2/3) is cube root of 9, approx 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R/a. Both stars have same R, so the probability for each planet is P1 = R/a1, P2 = R/a2.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, then P1 = R/(0.606 a2) ≈ (1.65) * (R/a2) = 1.65 * P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, but wait, because the formula is R / a. So if a is smaller, R/a is larger. So since a1 is smaller than a2, R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, as it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says 2.7 times.

Wait, wait, I thought the factor was 2^(1/3)/3^(2/3) for a1/a2.

Wait, 2^(1/3) is 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26. 3^(2/3) is (3^(1/3))^2 ≈ (1.442)^2 ≈ 2.08.

So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So for transit probabilities:

P1 = R / a1 = R / (0.606 a2) ≈ 1.65 * (R/a2) = 1.65 P2.

So P1 is 1.65 times higher than P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher, so they should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So the answer should be option C.

To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Both planets have the same mass, and their host stars have the same radius, so the key factor is the semi-major axis \( a \), which depends on the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M \) via Kepler's third law: 

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M}.
\]

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes
Given that Planet_1's orbital period \( P_1 \) is three times shorter than Planet_2's orbital period \( P_2 \), we have \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \). The mass of Planet_1's host star is twice that of Planet_2's host star, \( M_1 = 2M_2 \). Using Kepler's law, the semi-major axis is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M^{1/3} P^{2/3}\right).
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left(M_1^{1/3} P_1^{2/3}\right) = \left(2^{1/3} M_2^{1/3} \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^{2/3}\right).
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left(M_2^{1/3} P_2^{2/3}\right).
\]

Dividing \( a_1 \) by \( a_2 \), we find:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{3^{2/3}} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius \( R \), the probability of transit is inversely proportional to \( a \). Therefore:

\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R}{a_1}, \quad P_2 \propto \frac{R}{a_2}.
\]

Substituting \( a_1 = 0.606a_2 \), we find:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R}{a_1}}{\frac{R}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. Among the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
