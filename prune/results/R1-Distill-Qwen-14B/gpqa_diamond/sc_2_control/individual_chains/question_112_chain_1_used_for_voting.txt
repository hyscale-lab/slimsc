Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The up and down states are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I remember is the Sz operator. So Sz|up> = (ħ/2)|up> and similarly for |down>, but with -ħ/2.

The first part of the problem asks to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation A with elements A_ij. The rule is A_ij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does that matrix look like?

Wait, for a 2x2 matrix, with i and j being the row and column indices. So when i ≠ j, A_ij is ħ/2. Otherwise, it's zero. So the matrix would be:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

Wait, is that correct? Because if i=1, j=2, then A_12 = ħ/2. Similarly, A_21 = ħ/2. And the diagonal elements are zero. So it's a 2x2 matrix with the off-diagonal elements as ħ/2 and diagonal as zero.

Wait, but wait. What operator has such a matrix? Oh right, the Pauli X operator scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply that by ħ/2, we get exactly this matrix A. So the operator in question is (ħ/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are the |+x> and |-x> states, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Right, the eigenstates can be written as |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/√2. Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the question is, given the state |alpha>, what is the probability of measuring it in each of the eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, and then find the average value of the operator A.

But wait, the first step is to find the coefficients of |alpha> in the basis of |up> and |down>, then express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, find the expansion coefficients, square their magnitudes for probabilities, and then compute the expectation value.

But let's start by normalizing |alpha>. The given state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I need to find the normalization factor.

The vector is [ (1+i), (2 - i) ]^T. The normalization is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the components.

The magnitude squared for the first component is |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, the second component's magnitude squared is |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. Let me write |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |-x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |-x>)/√2
|down> = (|+x> - |-x>)/√2

Substituting these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (|+x> + |-x>)/√2 ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (|+x> - |-x>)/√2 ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

|alpha> = [1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))] * [ (1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) ]

Expanding:

= [1/(sqrt(14))] [ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i)) |-x> ]

Simplify the coefficients:

For |+x>:
(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) )= 3.

Wait, wait, that's correct? Let me compute (1+i) + (2 -i) = 1+2 + i -i = 3 + 0i =3.

For |-x>:
(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i+i )= -1 + 2i.

So the state becomes:

|alpha> = [1/sqrt(14)] [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ]

But wait, wait a second. No, wait, actually, the expansion is:

(1+i)(|+x> + |-x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |-x>) 

= (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|-x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|-x>

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] |+x> + [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |-x>

Which is 3 |+x> + [ (1+i -2 +i) ] |-x>

So 1-2 is -1, and i +i is 2i. So [ -1 + 2i ] |-x>

So yeah, the same as before.

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |-x> ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, I can check the sqrt(7) and sqrt(2) multiplications: sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) is sqrt(14), so correct.

Now, to find the probability of measuring |+x> and |-x>, we take the square of the magnitudes of the coefficients in front of |+x> and |-x> respectively.

Coefficient for |+x> is 3 / sqrt(14). So probability is |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Coefficient for |-x> is (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is | -1 + 2i |^2 / 14.

Compute | -1 + 2i |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 =1 +4=5. So probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.357142...

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is approximately 9/14 (~0.642) and 5/14 (~0.357). So 0.64 and 0.36, which would match option A.

Wait, but wait, is that the correct approach? Because I thought the probabilities would sum to one, which they do: 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1.

So probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The operator A has eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, corresponding to |+x> and |-x> states.

The expectation value <A> is sum (prob_i * eigenvalue_i )

So <A> = (9/14)( ħ/2 ) + (5/14)( -ħ/2 )

Compute this:

= (9/14)( ħ/2 ) - (5/14)( ħ/2 )

= [ (9 -5) /14 ] ( ħ/2 )

= (4/14)( ħ/2 )

Simplify 4/14 to 2/7, so 2/7 * ħ/2 = (2 * ħ )/(7*2) )= ħ/7.

Wait, that's interesting. So the average value is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7. So that would match.

But let me check the options again:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7. That's what I got.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 and 2ħ/sqrt(7). Hmm, no.

Wait, but wait, my calculation of the expectation value may have an error because I might have made a mistake in considering the operator.

Wait, the operator is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, so when you compute the expectation value, it's (alpha| A |alpha).

Alternatively, I could compute the expectation value directly via the matrix elements.

Let me try that approach as a cross-check.

First, the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

The operator A is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its matrix is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli X matrix.

So the expectation value <A> is (1/7) times the conjugate transpose of [1+i, 2 -i] multiplied by matrix A, multiplied by [1+i; 2 -i].

Wait, let's write it out. The expectation value <A> is (1/7) times [ (1-i), (2 + i) ] multiplied by A matrix, multiplied by [ (1+i); (2 -i) ].

Wait, the matrix A is:

[0, ħ/2]
[ħ/2, 0]

So when you compute the product, it's (1/7) [ (1-i) (0)(1+i) + (1-i)( ħ/2 )(2 -i) ) + (2 +i)( ħ/2 )(1+i) ) + (2 +i)(0)(2 -i) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute the vector multiplied by A, then take the dot product with the conjugate vector.

Alternatively, the expectation value is (1/7) * [ (1+i)^* (0) (1+i) + (1+i)^* (ħ/2) (2 -i) + (2 -i)^* (ħ/2) (1+i) + (2 -i)^* (0) (2 -i) ) ]

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me structure this correctly.

The expectation value is (1/7) times [ [ (1-i), (2 +i) ] * (A) * [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T ].

So let's compute the matrix multiplication.

Compute A * |alpha> vector:

The vector is [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So A * vector is:

First component: 0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i) )= ( ħ/2 )(2 -i )

Second component: (ħ/2)(1+i) + 0*(2 -i) )= ( ħ/2 )(1 +i )

Now, take the conjugate transpose of the original vector [ (1-i), (2 +i) ] and multiply by this result.

So the product is:

(1-i) * ( ħ/2 (2 -i) ) + (2 +i) * ( ħ/2 (1 +i) )

Factor out ħ/2:

= ( ħ/2 ) [ (1 - i)(2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1. So 2-3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)
= 2 -i -2i + (i^2)
= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)
= (2 -1) -3i
= 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i +i*1 +i*i.

= 2 + 2i +i + i^2
= 2 +3i + (-1) 
= (2-1) +3i 
=1 +3i.

So adding these two terms:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) = 2 +0i = 2.

So the expectation value <A> is ( ħ/2 ) * (2) * (1/7) )

Wait, because the whole thing is multiplied by 1/7, right? Because the state is (1/sqrt(7)) times the vector, so when you compute the expectation value, it's (1/7)*( ... )

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck.

The vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So when you compute the expectation value, it's:

(1/7) [ (1-i)(A_{11}(1+i) + A_{12}(2 -i)) ) + (2 +i)(A_{21}(1+i) + A_{22}(2 -i)) ) ]

But in any case, through the matrix multiplication, we found that the product [ (1-i), (2+i) ] * (A * [ (1+i); (2 -i) ]) equals 2, and the expectation is (1/7) * (ħ/2 * 2) ) = (1/7) * ħ.

So <A> = ħ/7, which matches what I found earlier.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.643 and 5/14 ≈ 0.357, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36 as in option A.

Average value is ħ/7, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A's average is ħ/7, which is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and ħ/7. That's what I got, so the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, let me check if I made any miscalculations in the probabilities.

In the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we have:

3/sqrt(14) |+x> + (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) |-x>

The magnitude squared for |+x> is (3)^2 /14 =9/14≈0.6428.

The magnitude squared for |-x> is |(-1 + 2i)|^2 /14.

|(-1 + 2i)|^2 = ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 )= 1 +4=5. So 5/14≈0.357.

So probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So option A is correct for that.

Yes, so the answer should be option A.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. The states |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, Sz, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. To normalize |α⟩, we calculate the squared magnitudes of its components:

- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2  
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5  

The normalization factor is √(2 + 5) = √7. Thus, the normalized state is:  
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down⟩
\]

Next, we express |α⟩ in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given as:  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X operator, with eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:  
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

Substituting these into |α⟩:  
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right],
\]
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x⟩ + |-x⟩) + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x⟩ - |-x⟩) \right].
\]

Simplifying:  
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x⟩ + (-1 + 2i)|-x⟩ \right].
\]

The coefficients of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are 3/√14 and (-1 + 2i)/√14, respectively. The probabilities of measuring the particle in |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:  
\[
P(+x) = \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-x) = \left|\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

Next, we calculate the average value of the operator A. The eigenvalues of A are ±ħ/2, corresponding to |+x⟩ and |-x⟩. The expectation value is:  
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:  
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right),
\]
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is ħ/7. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
