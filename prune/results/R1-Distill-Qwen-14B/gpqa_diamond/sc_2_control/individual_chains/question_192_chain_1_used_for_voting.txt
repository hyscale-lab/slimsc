Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem is about a conductor with a cavity. So, there's a spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. 

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm. Let's think about conductors and charges. I remember that when a conductor is uncharged, any charge placed inside a cavity will induce charges on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged, and then we add a charge +q inside the cavity. 

So, when +q is placed in the cavity, it will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was neutral, the inner surface must have -q. But what about the outer surface? Since the total charge of the conductor is zero, the outer surface will have +q, because the inner surface has -q, and the conductor itself must balance that.

Wait no, wait a minute. The conductor as a whole is neutral. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q; then, the outer surface must have +q, because the conductor's total charge is the sum of inner and outer surfaces. So the outer surface has +q.

But how does this affect the electric field outside the conductor? I remember that for a conducting shell, the electric field outside depends only on the total charge outside the shell. So in this case, the outer surface has +q, so the electric field outside should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P should be due to the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is +q. But wait, the charge distribution on the outer surface—how is it arranged?

Since the conductor is spherical, the outer surface should be a uniform sphere. Or wait, no. Wait, the outer surface would have a charge distribution that depends on any external influences. But in this case, the problem doesn't mention any other charges or external fields, so the conductor is isolated. So the outer surface will have a uniform charge distribution.

Wait, but the cavity is off-center. So the charge +q is placed inside the cavity, which is not at the center of the conductor. Does that affect the charge distribution on the outer surface?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q, because it's induced by the +q in the cavity. The conductor's total charge is zero, so the outer surface must have +q. Now, considering the arrangement of the outer surface's charge.

If the cavity is off-center (the center of the cavity is separated by s from the center of the conductor), then the charge on the outer surface might not be uniformly distributed. Because the inner charge is off-center, the outer surface might have a dipole or some other distribution.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge distribution depends on the symmetry. If the cavity's charge is off-center, the inner surface's charge would arrange itself to cancel the field inside the conductor. But the outer surface's charge would be determined by the method of images, I think. Wait, no, the method of images is more for solving problems with charges outside the conductor.

Alternatively, I remember that the electric field outside a conductor is only due to the charges on the outer surface. The field due to the inner charges (like the cavity's charge and the induced inner surface) doesn't affect the region outside. So the outer surface's charge distribution is what matters for the external field.

But how does the position of the cavity's charge affect the outer surface's charge distribution? Since the cavity is off-center, the inner surface's charge is distributed such that it cancels the field in the conductor. The inner surface's charge would arrange itself to mirror the charge inside the cavity. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would have a uniform distribution if the conductor is isolated and no external fields are present.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface's charge would not be uniform. It would be more concentrated on the side closer to the cavity's charge. But that's the inner surface. The outer surface, being a sphere, when the conductor is neutral overall, would have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is a sphere. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer surface's charge is uniformly spread.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral. The inner surface has -q, outer has +q. But the outer surface is a sphere. So the distribution of the +q on the outer surface would be uniform if there are no external influences. Because the conductor shields the inside from external fields, but here, the internal field is from the cavity's charge. The outer surface, however, is isolated, so its charge would distribute uniformly.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is a sphere. The outer surface's charge distribution depends on whether the conductor is in electrostatic equilibrium. Since it's a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. So the charges on the outer surface arrange themselves in such a way that their field, plus any fields from other charges, cancels inside the conductor.

But in this case, the only other charges are the inner surface's -q. The inner surface creates an electric field in the conductor which must be canceled by the outer surface's charges. Wait, no. The inner surface's charge is such that the field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface's charges don't influence the inner surface's distribution. Hmm. Alternatively, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere and there's no external field.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that any charges inside the cavity (like +q) will cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge of -q. The outer surface must have +q because the conductor is neutral. Now, the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

But where is this +q located? Since the outer surface is a sphere, the charges are uniformly distributed. So the electric field outside would be as if the charge were at the center of the sphere. So E should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. So looking at the options, option B is that.

Wait, but let me double-check. The options are:

Option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(L²)

Option D: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q/(l²)

Wait, but what's the distance from the charge to point P? Because the charge is at the center of the outer sphere, so the distance for P is L. So E would be q/(4πε₀ L²) as per Coulomb's law.

But wait, I'm neglecting something. Because the charge +q isn't at the center of the conductor. Oh wait no, the charge in the cavity is off-center, but the outer surface charge is on the conductor, which is a sphere. So the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the center of the outer surface's charge is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the charge in the cavity is at a distance s from the center. So the inner surface's charge would be arranged such that the field inside the conductor is zero. But since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform.

Therefore, the electric field outside would be the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), right?

Because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P. So the answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The point P is at distance L from the center, but the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. The angle is theta. So is the position of the cavity's charge affecting the electric field at P?

Wait, no. Because the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed on the conductor. So regardless of where the inner charge is, the external field is due to the uniform +q on the outer conductor. So the field outside would be as if the charge q were at the center of the conductor.

So yes, option B is correct.

Wait, but some of the other options seem to involve l and theta. For instance, option A and C have expressions involving (l ± s cos theta). Why would that be so?

Hmm. Maybe I missed something. Let's think again. The point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's influence is such that the field outside depends only on the outer charge. But perhaps the charge in the cavity is creating an image charge or something. Or perhaps the inner and outer charges are affecting the field.

Wait, no. The inner charges (cavity and induced inner surface) don't affect the field outside the conductor. The outer surface's charge is what matters. So if the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, then the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

So I think option B is correct. Because the field outside depends on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distance from the center is L.

Wait, but what if the conductor's outer surface isn't spherically symmetric? But in this case, the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface is spherical, meaning the charge distribution is uniform.

Wait, but if the cavity is off-center, then the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. But the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because it's a sphere. So the field outside is as if the charge is at the center.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

To solve the problem, we analyze the setup: an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ contains a small spherical cavity of radius $r$, with its center separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the system.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface of the conductor. In this case, the outer surface has a charge of $+q$, and the conductor is spherical. This ensures that the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform.

3. **Effect of Off-Center Cavity**: Although the cavity is off-center (separated by $s$ from the center of the conductor), the uniform distribution of charge on the outer surface ensures that the electric field outside the conductor is unaffected by the position of the cavity or the induced charges on the inner surface. The field outside depends solely on the total charge on the outer surface, which is $+q$, and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor to the point $P$.

4. **Electric Field Expression**: Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at point $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   This matches option **B**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$, not on $l$ or $\theta$.
- **Option B**: Correct, as explained above.
- **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is incorrect for the same reason as option A.
- **Option D**: Involves $l^2$, which is incorrect because the distance $L$ (not $l$) determines the electric field outside the conductor.

### Conclusion:
The electric field at point $P$ is solely due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor, and its magnitude is given by option **B**.
