Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... I think that's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (D) at position 2. Or maybe it's a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? No, probably not. Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene? So, positions 1 and 2 have Br and D respectively.

The reagent is NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But wait, in what contexts? Oh right, when dealing with aromatic compounds, especially under certain conditions, it can lead to elimination or substitution reactions.

Wait, the solvent is condensed ammonia. That's a typical solvent for elimination reactions, like the formation of alkenes from alkyl halides via E2 mechanisms. But wait, benzene rings are aromatic, so what's happening here?

Alternatively, I'm thinking maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But benzene rings don't usually undergo elimination unless there's a substituent that can form a double bond with the ring. Wait, but if the ring already has a Br in position 1 and a D in position 2, maybe the D is a substituent that can leave?

Wait, deuterium is a hydrogen isotope. It's not as acidic as regular hydrogen, but in some cases, especially under certain conditions, it might be deprotonated. Or wait, maybe the Br is the leaving group here. So, if it's 1-bromobenzene-2-d, maybe the D is in the ortho position relative to Br, which is at position 1.

Wait, if the ring has Br at position 1 and D at 2, and it's treated with a strong base like NaNH2, perhaps an elimination reaction occurs. But benzene is a stable ring; how would elimination work here?

Alternatively, I'm thinking about aromatic substitution. Maybe this is a case of dehydrohalogenation, but that's more for aliphatic compounds. Wait, but benzene rings are pretty stable. Unless we're forming a diene or something else.

Wait another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base. Could it deprotonate something? The D (deuterium) is in position 2. But D is a heavier isotope and less acidic than H. So under what conditions would D be deprotonated? I'm not sure. Maybe the base is strong enough, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the Br is in the ring as a substituent, and the solvent and base are facilitating an elimination. Like in the formation of benzyne? Benzyne is a aryne, which is a benzene ring with a triple bond. But how does that happen?

Oh wait, I think when a dihalobenzene is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate two halides to form benzyne. But in this case, we only have one Br and a D. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the D is a leaving group? But D is not a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is the leaving group, and the D is just a substituent. So maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to an elimination.

Wait, but in benzene rings, the positions are all similar, but the substituents influence the reactivity. Let me draw the structure: Br is at position 1, D at 2. So the ring has Br, then D in the next position. If the base abstracts a proton in position 3 or 4 or 6, maybe leading to an elimination of Br and H, forming a triple bond between 1 and 2? But wait, that's adjacent to D. Hmm.

Alternatively, the base could abstract a proton that's para or meta to Br, but I'm not sure how that would help. Wait, let me think about the possible deprotonation sites.

In benzene, the protons adjacent to substituents are more acidic. So the positions ortho and para to Br would have more acidic protons. But in this case, position 2 has a D, so the adjacent positions would be 3 and 6. If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, that's adjacent to Br at 1 and D at 2.

Wait, so after deprotonation at position 3, elimination of Br from position 1 would form a double bond between C1 and C2? But that would lead to a triple bond because we're eliminating two substituents. Wait, no: if a base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, then the Br could leave as Br-, and a double bond forms between the adjacent carbons.

Wait, but in this case, the D is at position 2, which is next to Br at 1. So if a base abstracts a proton at position 3, the Br at 1 and the proton at 3 are on adjacent carbons. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, C2 has a D. So would the D stay or leave?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. So in a benzene ring with two substituents, perhaps an elimination occurs to form a triple bond. But wait, I'm trying to remember the conditions for aryne formation.

Oh, right! The benzene ring must have two good leaving groups, typically halogens, in adjacent positions. Then, upon treatment with a strong base, they eliminate to form a triple bond (benzyne). But in this problem, we have only one Br and a D. So that might not be the case.

Wait, but perhaps the D is a substituent, and the Br leaves. But wait, D is deuterium, so maybe it doesn't leave. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton to form a carbanion, which could then eliminate Br.

Let me consider the structure again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So positions are:

1: Br
2: D
3: H
4: H
5: H
6: H

So the ring has Br at 1 and D at 2. Now, the base (NH2^-) could abstract a proton that's adjacent to Br, perhaps in position 3. Then, the Br would leave, but wait, what's the mechanism here? If NH2^- abstracts a proton from position 3, making a carbanion at 3, but that's not directly adjacent to the Br. Alternatively, maybe it abstracts a proton from position 4 or 6, which are meta to Br. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is a substitution. But under what conditions? Bromide is a good leaving group, but for aromatic substitution, you usually need something like a strong activating group. But benzene is deactivated by Br (since it's an electron-withdrawing group), making substitution less favorable.

Wait, but in the presence of a strong base, could elimination occur? Let's think about the possibility of forming a benzene ring with a triple bond. But for that, you usually need two leaving groups. So if our starting material only has one Br and a D, maybe it's not possible.

Wait, but maybe the D is a leaving group? No, D is a deuterium; it's not a good leaving group under normal conditions. Unless in some specific conditions, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a substituent, and the reaction removes the Br, but in what way? For elimination, you need two adjacent leaving groups, but we only have Br and D here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the D is not a leaving group but part of the ring. So, after elimination of Br, perhaps we form a diene or something else. Wait, but elimination usually requires adjacent leaving groups. Maybe the D is not involved in the leaving.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an aromatic substitution where Br is replaced by something else. But under these conditions? NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile, so perhaps that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, making a carbanion, which then eliminates the Br. For example, if the base removes a proton from position 2, but position 2 has a D. Oh wait, D is a deuterium, so maybe the base can't abstract that. So the base would abstract a proton from position 3 (ortho to Br) or position 4 (meta to Br).

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, then the adjacent Br could leave, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2. But wait, C2 has a D. So would the D stay attached? That would make a double bond between C1 and C2, with C2 having a D and C1 being part of the ring. But that's not possible because double bonds require two adjacent carbons without substituents. Wait, but the D is on C2, so if the double bond forms between C1 and C2, then C2 would have a D and be spÂ² hybridized, which is possible.

Wait, but if the D is on C2, after elimination, would that structure be possible? So the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, making a ring with a triple bond? No, wait, elimination of H and Br would form a double bond.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So if we eliminate H from C3 and Br from C1, then the ring would have a double bond between C1 and C2, but C2 has a D. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, and a D on C2. But wait, that would make C1 and C2 each have two substituents (double bond and D on C2). Hmm, not sure if that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to a triple bond in the ring. But for a triple bond, you need two adjacent carbons each losing a substituent. So in that case, perhaps if the base abstracts a proton from C2, but C2 has a D. Oh, but the D can't be abstracted because it's not a proton. So maybe the base can't abstract a proton from C2, as it's occupied by D.

Alternatively, the base abstracts a proton from C3 or C6. Let's say it abstracts from C3. Then, Br at C1 and H at C3 are on adjacent carbons. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, but wait, C2 has a D. So the structure would be 1,2-dideuteroethylene? No, perhaps not. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but a single bond with a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the D is not involved in the reaction, and the base abstracts a proton elsewhere, leading to a di-substituted product.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. So, benzene can't form a double bond because it's already aromatic, but if you have multiple substituents, maybe an allene or something else forms.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. Reacting with NaNH2 in NH3.

Wait, another approach: NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate compounds. In this case, perhaps the base abstracts a proton alpha to the Br, leading to an elimination where Br leaves, forming a benzene ring with a double bond.

So if the proton is abstracted from position 3, then elimination would occur between C1 and C2, but C2 has a D, so the double bond would be between C1 and C2, making a ring with a substituent D on C2 and a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would make the ring have a double bond and perhaps a different structure.

Wait, but benzene with a double bond between two adjacent carbons would be an antiaromatic compound, which is not favorable, so that's unlikely. So perhaps that's not the pathway.

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton from a position that's meta to Br, say position 4 or 6. If the base takes a proton from position 4, then elimination could occur between C1 and C3? But those aren't adjacent. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. So, the Br is replaced by something else. But with NaNH2, which is a base, not a nucleophile. So substitution via SN2 is unlikely because the ring is not a good leaving group. Unless it's elimination.

Wait, another thought: maybe the Br is a leaving group, and the base abstracts a proton from a neighboring carbon, leading to an elimination product. So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond where the Br and H were, but adjacent substituents might influence that.

But then, if the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2, but C2 has a D, would that be possible? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the D stays, and the product becomes a di-substituted benzene with a double bond somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a benzene ring with a double bond, but I'm not certain about the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is part of a substituent. Wait, no, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So it's benzene with Br at 1 and D at 2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring contraction or expansion, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the base abstracts a proton that's para to Br, but then I don't see how that would lead to elimination. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't involve elimination but deuterium exchange. But I don't think so because the conditions are strongly basic and involve NaNH2, which is more about deprotonation than isotopic exchange.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion, which could rearrange or undergo some other reaction. But I'm not sure what that would look like.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 can also act as a reducing agent in some contexts. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the number of possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products are formed.

If the reaction leads to elimination, the product would have a triple bond (benzyne), but we need two adjacent leaving groups for that. Since we have only Br and D, and D isn't a leaving group, perhaps elimination isn't possible.

Wait, unless the D is replaced by something else. No, the D is a substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a substitution where the Br is replaced by another group, but under basic conditions, that's less likely.

Wait, maybe the D is involved in the reaction. But since D is not a good leaving group, I don't think so.

Wait, maybe the Br leaves, but the base can't abstract a proton adjacent to it, so no elimination occurs. Then, perhaps no reaction happens, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a single bond between C1 and C2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of similar reactions I've heard about. For example, when 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate two Cl and Br to form benzyne. But in this case, we only have one Br and a D. So no elimination.

Wait, perhaps the D is a substituent, and the reaction leads to substitution at another position. But under these conditions, substitution is unlikely.

Wait, is there another possibility? Maybe coupling reaction? But NaNH2 isn't typically used for coupling.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction. But I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the D is a deuterium and the reaction involves some kind of hydrogen/deuterium exchange, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond. But how?

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, adjacent to Br at 1. Then, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between C1 and C2. But C2 already has a D, so the product would have a double bond between C1 and C2, with C2 bearing a D.

Wait, but that would make the ring have a double bond, which would disrupt aromaticity. Benzene can't have a double bond because that would break the aromaticity. So that's probably not favorable.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, and no products are formed. But the options don't include zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a di-substituted benzene, and the reaction leads to a mono-substituted product. How?

Wait, if the D is in position 2, and the Br is in 1, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 4 (para to Br), leading to a meta substitution.

But I'm not sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I think the key is that the reaction is an elimination to form benzyne. But for that, we need two adjacent leaving groups. Since our starting material has only one Br and a D, which is not a leaving group, elimination isn't possible. So perhaps no reaction occurs, but that's not an option.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the D is a leaving group in some way. But I don't think D can leave as a deuterium ion easily under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the D somehow. Maybe the D is replaced by something else? But the reagent is NaNH2 and NH3, which doesn't provide any new substituents.

Wait, perhaps the D doesn't participate, and the Br is eliminated. But then, what's the product? Maybe a benzene ring with a carbanion, but that's unlikely to be stable.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is that no reaction occurs, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question asks for possible products, implying that a product is formed.

Wait, another thought: maybe the D is a substituent, and the Br is eliminated, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between C1 and C2. But as I thought earlier, that would make the ring non-aromatic. So perhaps it's not feasible. So, perhaps no reaction occurs, but the options don't have zero.

Wait, maybe the D is involved in the elimination. If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, then the Br at 1 and the H at 3 are on adjacent carbons. But the D is at position 2, which is adjacent to position 1. So, eliminating H from position 3 and Br from position 1 would form a double bond between 1 and 2, but position 2 has a D. So the product would be a ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, and a D at 2. But that would make the structure 1,2-dideuteroethylene? No, that's not possible in a benzene ring.

Wait, maybe the ring becomes smaller, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond, but that would require two adjacent leaving groups. Since we don't have that, perhaps no product is formed.

But the options don't have zero. So perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the problem expects us to think of another possibility.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton that's adjacent to the D. Let's say it abstracts from position 3 again. Then, maybe the D doesn't leave, but the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2. But again, that's not aromatic.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible products again.

If the reaction leads to elimination, perhaps a benzene ring with a triple bond, but I can't see how with only Br and D.

Wait, maybe the D is a substituent, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a single substituent, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts the D, but deuterium is not a proton, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring where the Br is replaced by an amide or something else. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the D is a substituent, and the reaction leads to a substitution at another position, but under these conditions, I don't think that's likely.

Another possibility: maybe the reaction is a simple dehydrohalogenation, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond, but as I thought before, that would break aromaticity. So perhaps that's not favorable.

Wait, considering all this, maybe the only possible product is the starting material itself, meaning no reaction occurs. But the options don't have zero, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the D is part of a leaving group. But I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the options don't include that.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a single product. So, perhaps only one product is formed, which would be the elimination product, if possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought elimination isn't possible because we lack a second leaving group. So then, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton and the Br leaves, leading to a benzene ring with a carbanion, which then could pick up a proton from somewhere. But under these conditions, would that happen?

Wait, perhaps that's a possibility. The base abstracts a proton from position 3, making a carbanion at 3. Then, Br leaves, but what happens next? The ring is now a carbanion adjacent to a hole where Br was. But I'm not sure about the stability of that.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring would undergo some kind of rearrangement, but I can't think of what.

Wait, another angle: the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in ammonia. This is a common condition for dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides to form alkenes. But in this case, the starting material is a bromobenzene derivative. So perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a benzene ring with a double bond.

But I'm getting stuck because benzene rings don't typically form alkenes through elimination; they're already conjugated.

Wait, perhaps the D isn't involved in the reaction, and the Br is eliminated, leading to a benzene ring with a hydrogen removed. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So positions 1 and 2 have Br and D. When the base abstracts a proton from position 3, elimination of Br occurs, forming a double bond between C1 and C2. But as I thought earlier, that would make a non-aromatic ring, which is unlikely.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me look for another approach. What's the general reaction of bromobenzene with a strong base like NaNH2?

Wait, in some cases, benzene rings with good leaving groups can undergo elimination to form aryne intermediates. But that requires two adjacent leaving groups, like two bromides. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with NaNH2 forms benzyne. But in this case, we have only one Br and a D, which isn't a leaving group.

So, without two adjacent leaving groups, elimination to form benzyne isn't possible. So, perhaps no reaction occurs, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the D is a leaving group and the Br is eliminated. But D isn't a good leaving group, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the D is part of a substituent that can leave. But no, the D is on the ring.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by something else. But under these conditions, NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. So substitution via SN2 is unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a benzyne formation, but with only one Br. That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the D is not a substituent but a typo, and it's a methyl group or something else. But the question says 2-d, so it's deuterium.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to multiple products because of the possible positions of elimination. But without two leaving groups, I don't see how multiple products can form.

Wait, another thought: if the D is in position 2, and the base abstracts a proton from position 3, then elimination could occur, but since the D is adjacent, perhaps the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 2, but that would require the D to leave as D^- which is unlikely.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 4, which is meta to Br, leading to some kind of elimination. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but a single bond with a double bond elsewhere. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Plus, Br is a meta-directing group, which makes substitution less favorable.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on what I know. Since the reaction requires two adjacent leaving groups for benzyne formation, and we only have one Br and a D, which isn't a leaving group, perhaps no elimination occurs. So, no product forms, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms one product via elimination, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a single substituent. But how?

Another angle: maybe the D is a deuterium and the reaction is a deuteration. But I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 2, but that's a D, so it can't. So the base abstracts a proton from position 3, leading to elimination of Br and formation of a double bond. But that would disrupt aromaticity, so it's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond, but that's unstable. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, and no products are formed, but again, the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, but only if D can leave, which it can't. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the substitution of Br with NH2. But NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile, so SN2 is unlikely. Plus, aromatic substitution for benzene rings is generally difficult unless activated.

Wait, but if the ring is activated, perhaps substitution is possible. But Br is a deactivating group, making substitution harder.

Hmm.

I think I'm going to have to make a guess. Since the question provides options, and I can't figure out the exact reaction, perhaps the answer is that no reaction occurs, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a single product.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a single product where the Br and a proton are eliminated, forming a double bond. But as I thought earlier, that's not favorable because it breaks aromaticity.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is that one product is formed.

Wait, but the options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

If the reaction forms one product, the answer is B)1.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the D is replaced by something else, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a substitution where the Br is replaced by an amide group, but that's not likely under these conditions.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination forming a single product, regardless of the aromaticity issue. So, the answer is one product.

In that case, the answer would be B)1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d (a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2) with NaNHâ in condensed ammonia solvent. NaNHâ is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions, but the reaction conditions and the structure of the starting material must be carefully analyzed.

1. **Reaction Context**: NaNHâ is typically used for deprotonation and elimination reactions. However, benzene rings are aromatic and stable, making elimination or substitution reactions challenging unless specific conditions are met.

2. **Starting Material**: The molecule has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. Deuterium (D) is not a good leaving group, and bromine (Br) is an electron-withdrawing group, making substitution less favorable. Elimination reactions typically require two adjacent leaving groups, but only Br is present as a leaving group.

3. **Elimination Possibility**: For elimination to occur, two adjacent leaving groups (e.g., Br and H) are usually required to form a triple bond (benzyne). However, the presence of D at position 2 complicates this process, as D is not a leaving group. Even if a proton is abstracted from position 3 (adjacent to Br), elimination would likely disrupt the aromaticity of the benzene ring, making it unfavorable.

4. **Substitution Possibility**: Substitution reactions are unlikely under these conditions because NaNHâ is a base, not a nucleophile, and bromine is a deactivating group, making aromatic substitution difficult.

5. **Reaction Outcome**: Given the lack of two adjacent leaving groups and the unfavorable conditions for elimination or substitution, it is unlikely that a reaction proceeds to form a new product. However, the question implies that a product is formed, and the options provided suggest a single possible product.

Based on the analysis, the reaction likely results in the formation of one product. 

Answer: B
