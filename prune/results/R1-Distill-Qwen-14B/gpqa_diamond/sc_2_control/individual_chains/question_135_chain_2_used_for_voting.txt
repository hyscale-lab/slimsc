Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question is about the possible decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I think the key point is the mass and what particles it can decay into.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, so the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions. The fermions involved would be the ones that are part of the ψ_f, right? So like, the ψ_f(y) are the fermion fields that X can interact with.

But wait, the main point is the decay. For a boson to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, the mass of the boson has to be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because each fermion in the pair would have to have mass less than half of X's mass, right?

X's mass is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a mass less than 3 GeV each. Because 2m < 6 GeV → m < 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than 3 GeV? Let me think about the known fermion masses. Well, up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top, etc., and the leptons like electron, muon, tau.

Electron: way less than 1 GeV. Same for muon, tau is heavier, around 1.78 GeV. Oh wait, tau is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So pairs like tau+ tau- would be allowed since each tau is about 1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 is ~3.56 GeV. Wait, wait, that's more than 6 GeV? No, wait no, no. Wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so each fermion in the pair must be less than 3 GeV. So for a tau pair, each is ~1.78 GeV, so 1.78 * 2 = 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Wait, but wait what about the top quark? Top is super heavy, like around 173 GeV, way above 3 GeV. So no, can't decay into top quarks.

What about the bottom quark? The bottom is about 4.5 GeV, I think. So each b quark is ~4.5 GeV. So 2 * 4.5 =9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV. So b quarks are out.

What about the charm quark? Charm is like 1.5 GeV. So 2 * 1.5 is 3 GeV, which is exactly half of X's mass. So that's allowed. So X can decay into c c-bar.

Similarly, up quark is like 2 MeV, so 2 * 2 MeV is negligible, so X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, etc.

What about the electron, muon? Their masses are way below 3 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.

So putting this together, the allowed decay channels are any fermion pairs where each fermion is less than 3 GeV. So possible pairs are u, d, s, c, tau, and the leptons e and mu.

Wait, but wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian is given as involving ψ_f, which I suppose is the fermion field. The interaction is -λ f f-bar X. So for the decay X → f f-bar to be possible, the X must have a vertex with two fermions.

But wait, X being a boson, how does that work? I think the interaction term would usually have terms like X ψ ψ, so each term would involve two fermion fields and the boson. So the decay would have X producing a pair of fermions.

So the possible decays are any fermion pairs where the sum of their masses is less than 6 GeV. But each fermion has to be less than 3 GeV because m_f has to be less than 6/2.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
But b is about 4.5 GeV, so 2 *4.5=9>6. So this decay is not allowed. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
All these fermions are below 3 GeV. Because c is ~1.5 GeV, s is ~0.1 GeV (light), u and d are even lighter. Tau is ~1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78≈3.56<6, so allowed. Mu and e are negligible. So this option includes c, which is allowed, but does it have any others that are not allowed? I don't think so.

Option C: X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Wait, t is top quark, mass 173 GeV. So 2*173 is way above 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into t t-bar. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Again, the b is too heavy, so this decay is not allowed.

So the correct option is B, because it includes c c-bar (allowed), s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau pair, mu pair, e pair. All of these are below 3 GeV each, so their sum is below 6 GeV.

Wait, but what about the top and bottom? As I thought, the bottom is too heavy. So the only possible fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. So the allowed decays are into these pairs.

In option B, yes, it's got c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. This means each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Electron (\( e \))**: Mass \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), well below 3 GeV. Allowed.
2. **Muon (\( \mu \))**: Mass \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), well below 3 GeV. Allowed.
3. **Tau (\( \tau \))**: Mass \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2 \times 1.78 = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
4. **Up quark (\( u \))**: Mass \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), negligible. Allowed.
5. **Down quark (\( d \))**: Mass \( \sim 3 \, \text{MeV} \), negligible. Allowed.
6. **Strange quark (\( s \))**: Mass \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), negligible. Allowed.
7. **Charm quark (\( c \))**: Mass \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2 \times 1.5 = 3 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed.
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \))**: Mass \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2 \times 4.5 = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed.
9. **Top quark (\( t \))**: Mass \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2 \times 173 = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Not allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark is too heavy. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \mu^{+}\mu^{-}, e^{+}e^{-} \). All these fermions are below 3 GeV, making their pairs allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because the top quark is too heavy. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because the bottom quark is too heavy. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs where the fermion masses are less than 3 GeV.
