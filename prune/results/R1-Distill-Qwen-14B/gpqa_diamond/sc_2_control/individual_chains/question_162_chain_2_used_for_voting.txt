Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, right? So we're dealing with a 2-manifold, probably embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but I don't think that's directly relevant here.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... that's like the surface of a sphere but with negative curvature, right? I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the pseudosphere is analogous to the sphere in spherical geometry. But wait, how does that relate to the metric given here?

Let me first recall that the area of a sphere in 2D (which is a circle) is 4πr². But for a pseudosphere in 2D, I think the area is also 4πr², but wait, no—wait, no, that's in 3D. Hmm, no, this metric is 2-dimensional. So the area might be similar, but maybe with a different coefficient because of the metric's properties.

Wait, the metric given here has a function multiplying the (dx² + dy²) term. That function is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So this looks like a metric for a surface with a specific curvature. Let me think about how to compute the area in this metric.

In differential geometry, the area (or volume, depending on dimensions) can be found by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is a 2D metric, the determinant would be (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy²), but because the metric is diagonal (only dx² and dy² terms), g_xy is zero. So the determinant is just (g_xx * g_yy). Then the area element would be sqrt(det g) dx dy.

Wait, but g_xx and g_yy are both the same here because the metric is the same in both directions. So g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So their product is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Wait, but the determinant would be that, so the square root would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but that's the area element. So to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. So where is the metric defined? The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So for the metric to be non-singular, 4 - x² - y² must not be zero. So x² + y² < 4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Oh, wait, that's exactly the pseudosphere of radius 2? Or wait, a pseudosphere in 2D is a model of hyperbolic space, but maybe here the metric represents something else.

Wait, perhaps this is the metric for a hyperbolic plane in Poincaré coordinates. The standard Poincaré disk model has the metric ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y². Wait, in the given metric, it's (dx² + dy^2) multiplied by 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see. If I factor out the 4, the denominator becomes 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So, 4 - x² - y² =4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/[4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4).

Hmm, so the metric ds² becomes [8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] (dx² + dy²). Which resembles the Poincaré disk metric but scaled. Let me think about the standard Poincaré disk: the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. So if I compare, in my case, the function is 8/(1 - (r²/4)), where r² = x² + y².

Wait, maybe I should perform a coordinate transformation to put it into a more familiar form. Let me let r² = x² + y². Then the metric becomes (8/(1 - r²/4)) (dx² + dy²). But dx² + dy² is dr² + r² dθ² in polar coordinates. So the metric is [8/(1 - r²/4)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Compare to the standard Poincaré disk metric: (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). So in the standard, the denominator is (1 - r²) squared, but here, it's (1 - r²/4) in the denominator, and the numerator is 8. Hmm.

But wait, what's the radius of curvature for hyperbolic space? In the Poincaré model, the curvature is -1/(R²), where R is the radius of the disk. The standard model uses R=1, so the curvature is -1. But in this case, the denominator has 1 - (r²/4), which suggests a different radius. Let me see: if I set r²/4 = r'^2, then r' = r/2. So maybe the radius of the disk is 2, because when r approaches 2, r' approaches 1, and the denominator becomes zero. Wait, but in the standard Poincaré disk, the radius is R, and the curvature is -1/R². So in this case, if the radius of the disk is 2, the curvature would be -1/(2²) = -1/4.

Wait, but the metric given here has a denominator of (4 - r²), which is 4(1 - r²/4) = 4(1 - (r/2)^2). So this is the same as the standard Poincaré metric scaled by a factor. Let me see: the standard Poincaré metric for radius R is (R²/(R² - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the Poincaré disk model has the metric:

ds² = (4 R²)/( (R² - r²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ² ), 

where r is the radial coordinate in the disk of radius R. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as:

ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²)

assuming R=1. So in the given problem, the denominator is 4 - r², so 4(1 - (r²/4)). So, if I factor that out, the denominator becomes 4(1 - (r²/4)) = 4(1 - (r/2)^2 ). So the metric is:

ds² = [32 / (4(1 - (r²/4)) ) ] (dr² + r² dθ² )

Because dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ² in polar coordinates. So simplifying, 32/(4(...)) is 8/(1 - (r²/4)), so:

ds² = [8/(1 - (r²/4)) ] (dr² + r² dθ² )

Comparing to the standard Poincaré metric (for R=2, perhaps?), which would have:

ds² = [4 R² / ( (R² - r²)^2 ) ] (dr² + r² dθ² )

So for R=2, R²=4. So,

ds² = [4 *4 / ( (4 - r²)^2 ) ] (dr² + r² dθ² )

Which is [16/( (4 - r²)^2 ) ] (dr² + r² dθ² )

Hmm, wait, that's different from the given metric, which is [8/(1 - r²/4)] (dr² + r² dθ² )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should think of this in terms of the line element. Another approach is to compute the Gaussian curvature of the metric, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, since the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius 2, maybe the area is similar to the sphere case. But wait, for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature), I remember that the area of a sphere in hyperbolic space is still 4πr², similar to the spherical case, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the area is infinite because the pseudosphere is unbounded.

Wait, wait a moment. The pseudosphere (in 2D) is actually a model of the hyperbolic plane, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. The hyperbolic plane, however, is non-compact and has infinite area. So if the pseudosphere here is representing the hyperbolic plane, then the area would be infinite. But the options include D) +infty. So perhaps that's the answer.

But wait, the question says, "the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Oh, but in the pseudosphere, perhaps a radius 2 implies a certain area. Wait, but in 3D, a pseudosphere is a surface with infinite area, but perhaps in 2D, it's the hyperbolic plane, which indeed has infinite area.

Wait, but the given metric is defined on the disk x² + y² <4, so the area would be the integral over this disk. But wait, the area element is not flat, it's curved. So the area might be infinite because the curvature affects the area.

Let me compute the area by integrating the area element over the disk. The area element is [32/(4 -x² - y²)] dx dy. So the integral would be ∫ (over x² + y² <4) [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Let me switch to polar coordinates. Let r² = x² + y², so x= r cosθ, y= r sinθ. Then dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

Integral (from r=0 to 2) Integral (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dθ dr.

The integral over θ is straightforward: 2π. So the integral becomes 32 * 2π ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Compute that integral:

Let me compute ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr.

Let u =4 - r² → du= -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [1/u] (-1/2) du = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

Evaluate from r=0 to r=2.

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2=0. So ln(0) is negative infinity, but we have a problem here because the integral is from 0 to 2. Let me see:

Wait, the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, when r approaches 2 from below, denominator approaches zero. So the integral from 0 to 2 is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) ) evaluated from 0 to 2.

At r=2: ln(0) → -infty, so this becomes (-1/2)(-infty) )= +infty.

At r=0: ln(4)= finite. So the integral from 0 to 2 is (+infty) - (finite) → +infty. So the area is 32 * 2π * infty → infinity. So the area is infinite.

But wait, wait a moment. The integral is 32 * 2π ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2, which is (64 π) times the integral. Since that integral diverges to infinity, the area is infinite.

So the answer would be option D) +infty.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the answer is D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a 2-dimensional metric defined on the domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. The metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the curvature is negative. In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is typically written as:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{4}{(1 - r^2)^2} \left( dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 \right),
\]

where \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \). Comparing this to the given metric, we see that the denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 \) can be rewritten as \( 4(1 - r^2/4) \), indicating a hyperbolic plane with a curvature scaled by a factor of 4.

To compute the total area of the pseudosphere (which, in this context, represents the hyperbolic plane embedded in the given metric), we calculate the integral of the area element over the domain \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \). The area element in this metric is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( r, \theta \)), where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \) and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Evaluating from \( r = 0 \) to \( r = 2 \), we find:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \ln(4 - r^2) \Big|_0^2 = -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln(0) - \ln(4) \right].
\]

As \( r \to 2 \), \( 4 - r^2 \to 0 \), so \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \). This makes the integral diverge to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the total area is:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot (+\infty) = +\infty.
\]

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
