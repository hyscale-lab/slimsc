Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let's see. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, let's break down the data provided. The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak here suggests the compound has an -OH group. Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range for carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a C=O stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated groups. Since it's lower than 1700, maybe it's an aromatic carbonyl or an amide, but I don't think we have any info about amines here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, so the compound likely has a double bond, maybe in an alkene or maybe conjugated with something else, like an aromatic ring.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, molecular ion peaks at 45 could be from certain functional groups. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment. Common fragments include (CH3)2O (which is 45), or maybe something else. Alternatively, 45 could correspond to an ester group or something else. Wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. So for example, (CH3)2O is 45 (since 2*(12+3) +16 = 24+16=40? Wait, no, wait. Wait, (CH3)2O is (2*15) +16= 30+16=46. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting something wrong. Let me calculate: 45 is the mass. So possible fragments: maybe (CH3)2COH? No, that's more than 45. Or perhaps CH3COO- would be 60? Hmm, maybe I should think of other possibilities. Alternatively, 45 could be from a methyl ester or something else.

So putting this together, let's consider the possible functional groups. The IR shows O-H (broad peak), and two carbonyls. So maybe this is a compound with both an -OH group and two carbonyl groups. Wait, but two carbonyls? That's a bit unusual. Or perhaps one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. Wait, sometimes aromatic rings can show absorption around 1600-1650, especially if conjugated with other groups like carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring. For example, maybe an aromatic ketone? Or maybe the 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an amide, but no amide info.

Wait, another possibility: the two peaks could be from different parts of the molecule. For example, one is a carbonyl group (1700), and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, which is usually around 1600-1650. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ketone or an aromatic ester.

But then, the 1H NMR shows vinyl protons, which suggests there's an alkene or maybe a conjugated system like in an aromatic ring with substituents that have protons attached to double bonds.

Wait, but vinyl protons would be in the range of around 4.5-7 ppm, typically. So in the NMR, those peaks would be in that region.

Now, the options for the molecular formulas are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Looking at these, let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there are no X or N here, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

So for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 = 1.

So one degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU = (14-10)/2=4/2=2.

Two degrees. So either two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (14-10)/2=2. Same as B.

Option D: C6H12O.

DoU = (14-12)/2=1.

So the options with two DoU are B and C. The others have one.

Now, considering the NMR data: vinyl protons. That implies the presence of a double bond. So the molecule must have at least one double bond, contributing one DoU. So the total DoU should be at least 1.

If the molecule has two DoU (options B and C), then the other DoU could come from an aromatic ring (if the molecule is aromatic) but wait, aromatic rings are conjugated, so benzene would have three DoU. Hmm, but that's getting more complicated.

Wait, but let me think about the IR. If the molecule has both O-H and carbonyl groups, that suggests it's a compound like a carboxylic acid or maybe an ester with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would have broad O-H from -COOH.

Alternatively, if it's an ester, which usually doesn't have an -OH group because esters are R-O-C-O-R. Wait, no, esters are R-O-C-O-R, but if the compound is an ester with another hydroxyl group, perhaps from a diol or something else.

Wait, but the fragment in the mass spec at m/z 45. Let me think about what that could be. 45 could be a fragment like (CH3)CO, which is 59? No, wait, (CH3)2O is 46. Hmm. Or perhaps it's a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene or another structure. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula gives a clue.

Wait, the molecular formula options have varying O counts. Let's consider each.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structures could be esters, maybe something like methyl cyclohexanoate. If it's an ester, perhaps the structure is an aromatic ester, but I'm not certain.

Option B: C6H10O. That would be something with two rings or one ring and one double bond. But with just one O.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygen atoms, two DoU. Could be something like a diester, or an ester plus an alcohol, or a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. One O, so maybe a cyclic ether, or an alcohol with a ring.

But back to the IR. We have a broad O-H peak, so that's probably an -OH group. Then, two carbonyl peaks. Wait, but two carbonyls? Or maybe one is a carbonyl, and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 is a carbonyl (like ester, ketone, aldehyde, acid), and the 1650 is an aromatic C=C. So the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. But wait, for benzene rings, the C=C absorb around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So 1650 is a bit higher, which could be due to conjugation.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an amide, but without an N, that's not possible.

Wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which could also be from an -OH group, but maybe an alcohol or a phenol. Alternatively, it could be an -NH stretch, but again, without info on N, perhaps it's an -OH.

So combining the IR data: O-H (alcohol or phenol) and a carbonyl (like ester, ketone, etc.), and another peak at 1650, which could be another functional group.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond or an aromatic ring with attached Hs.

The mass spec has a peak at 45. Let's think about molecular formulas. The possible molecular formulas for the options are:

A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

B: C6H10O. 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 16=16. Total 98.

C: C6H10O2. 6*12=72, 10, 32. Total 114.

D: C6H12O. 6*12=72,12,16. 100.

The mass spec shows a fragment at 45. Let's think about which of these could give a fragment of 45.

Looking at possible groups that have a mass of 45:

- CH3COO- (45? Wait, wait. CH3COO- is C2H3O2^-, which is (2*12) +3 + (16*2) = 24+3+32=59. Hmm, so that's not 45.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach: think about the possible structures that fit the data.

The compound must have an O-H group (from the broad IR peak), a carbonyl (from 1700), and a double bond (from the vinyl H NMR).

Looking at the options:

Let's think about each possible formula and see if it fits.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So one ring or one double bond. But wait, but the NMR shows vinyl (double bond) and IR shows a carbonyl. So if the compound is an ester, which has a carbonyl, and perhaps a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, a cyclic ester (like a lactone) with a double bond.

Wait, but a cyclic ester (lactone) would have a carbonyl and a ring, so two DoU. Wait, but option A is C6H12O2, which has a DoU of 1. So that can't be a lactone because a lactone is a five-membered ring (like gamma) would require four bonds, so maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ester, but that would require more DoU.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like methyl cyclohexanoate. Cyclohexane has a ring (one DoU). The ester group (COO) contributes another DoU. So that would be two DoU. But option A has DoU 1. So that's a conflict.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option and see which fits all the data.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is 2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds. Since the NMR shows vinyl Hs, it has at least one double bond. So perhaps a ring plus a double bond.

But this option has only one O. So possible structures: cyclohexene with an alcohol group? Like cyclohexenol. But then, the IR would show O-H (broad), and the 1700 and 1650 might not make sense. 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl, which cyclohexenol doesn't have. So maybe not.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

This compound has two O's. So possible functional groups: ester, ketone, etc.

If it's an ester, perhaps a structure like methyl cyclohexenoate. The ester group would have a carbonyl (1700 cm⁻¹), and the cyclohexene would have a double bond, giving the vinyl Hs in the NMR. Also, the cyclohexene ring would have a DoU of 1, and the ester another, totaling 2.

Wait, but methyl cyclohexenoate would have a formula of C7H10O2. Wait, no: cyclohexene is C6H10, and methyl ester would add one C and two O's. But wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. Let me think: cyclohexenoic acid would be C6H11COOH, but that's 8 carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that would require at least a five-membered ring (lactone), which would be C5H8O2, but that's not matching our option.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. Let's say, for example, the compound is methyl cyclopentenoate, but that would be a five-membered ring. Wait, but the formula given is C6H10O2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester? But I'm not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU is 1. So a ring or a double bond. The O is present. So maybe a cyclic ether (like THF), but that has no carbonyl. Alternatively, an alcohol with a ring. But again, without a carbonyl, the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 might not be explained.

Wait, but what if the compound has an -OH group, a carbonyl, and a double bond. Let's consider another approach: the molecular formula.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. If the molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=114. So 114 g/mol.

The mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. So 45 is part of the molecule. Let's think of possible fragments in a C6H10O2 molecule that would have a mass of 45. What's 45? Let's see:

- Maybe CH3COO-: which is (12+3)*2 +16*2? Wait, no, CH3COO- is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*2) = 24+3+32=59. So no.

Wait, 45 is 12+3*3 +16*0? No. Wait, 45 can be written as (something) like CH2O: 12+2+16=30. No, that's not enough. Or C3H7O? 3*12=36 +7=43 +16=59. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is (CH2)2O, which is 44 (12*2 + 2*1 +16=24+2+16=42? Wait, 12*2=24, 2 H's would be 2, and O 16: 24+2+16=42. So 42, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be (CH3)2O: (12*2) + 3*2 +16 = 24+6+16=46. Close, but not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a CO group. CO is 12+16=28. No. Or a COOH group would be 60.

Hmm, maybe the mass 45 comes from a different part. Let me think about the other options.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible structures. The presence of vinyl protons suggests a conjugated system, like an aromatic ring or a double bond adjacent to something.

The FTIR shows a broad O-H, so perhaps a phenol group. Phenols have O-H that's broad and strong. So if the compound is a phenol with an ester group or something else.

Wait, but then the molecular formula would have more carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is methyl salicylate, which is an ester with a phenol group. Let's see: methyl salicylate has the formula C8H8O3. But our options are C6-based. So that's not matching.

Wait, but perhaps it's a simpler compound. Maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde with an ester group. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester with a double bond.

Wait, but let's get back to the IR. Two carbonyl peaks. That's a bit confusing. Maybe the 1700 is from an ester or ketone, and the 1650 is from an aromatic ring's C=C stretching.

So, the molecule has an aromatic ring (which would have DoU 3 for benzene, but that's not matching the options). Wait, but if it's a substituted ring, maybe with one substituent that brings in a carbonyl. So if it's something like phenyl acetate, but again, the formula wouldn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, consider a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond. That would contribute two DoU (the ring and the ester). Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyl peaks are due to different types of carbonyl groups. But that's rare. More likely, one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring's stretch.

Wait, considering the NMR: the presence of vinyl protons suggests that there's a double bond with protons attached. So it's either an alkene (like CH2=CH-) or an aromatic ring with protons (like in ortho positions).

But aromatic protons usually appear downfield, like 7 ppm or higher. So if the NMR has peaks corresponding to vinyl protons, they might be in that region.

Putting it all together, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester with a hydroxyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the mass spec. The peak at 45 could correspond to something like a methyl group attached to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from an ester group.

Another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's calculate its molecular weight: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10+32=114.

The molecular ion would be at 114. The fragment at 45 would be a significant portion of the molecule. So perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and another part.

Wait, 45 is 114 - 69. So maybe the molecule breaks into a 45 and 69 fragment. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, 45 is 1/3 of 135, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 fragment is due to a CH3COO- group? No, that's 59. Wait, maybe it's a CH2O group? 44.

Wait, maybe it's a CH2(OH) group? No, that's 31.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, which is 44. So 44 and 70, but not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating the mass spec part. Let's think about the other data points again.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. The 1700 is a carbonyl. So the compound has both an -OH and a carbonyl group. So possible functional groups: ester (with another O-H?), but that's unlikely. Or a ketone with an -OH group. Or a carboxylic acid, which has both.

Wait, a carboxylic acid has a strong O-H stretch (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700. So that's a possibility. But then, what about the 1650 peak?

Wait, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring. So the compound would be an aromatic carboxylic acid. For example, benzoic acid. But benzoic acid is C7H6O2, which isn't one of the options. But our options have C6.

So perhaps it's an ortho-substituted benzoic acid with another group, but that would change the formula.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which would have a carbonyl. But then, the O-H would come from somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alpha hydroxy ester. For example, something like CH3COOCH2CH2OH. But that's a different formula.

Wait, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or acetal, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diol with a carbonyl group. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, let's consider the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So maybe a ring plus a double bond.

So perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring lactone with a double bond.

But for a six-membered lactone, the formula would be C5H8O2, which is not our case.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a double bond and a ring. But I'm not getting anywhere with this.

Wait, another approach: the presence of an ester group would have the carbonyl around 1700. An aromatic ring would have peaks around 1600-1500. The 1650 could fit that.

So perhaps the compound is an ester with an aromatic ring. But the formula doesn't match.

Wait, the options with two oxygens are A and C. If it's an ester, which has two oxygen atoms, then A and C are possible.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is 116.

The structure could be methyl cyclopentanoate, which is C6H10O2, but that doesn't match option A. Alternatively, perhaps a substituted ester with a ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group. So, for example, the ester group is attached to the cyclohexene.

But I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should think about the mass spec again.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the molecular weight is 114. If the mass spec has a peak at 45, which is less than half of the molecular weight, perhaps it's a fragment from the ester group.

Wait, 45 could be the methyl group (CH3) from an ester. But wait, the methyl group's mass is 15. Hmm, doesn't add up.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the ester oxygen plus something else.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is from the breakdown of an acetyloxy group. For example, if the compound has an OAc group (acetyloxy), that would be O-CO-CH3. The mass of the acetyl group (COCH3) is 59. So perhaps the fragment is the rest of the molecule minus that.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the peak at 45 is from a (CH2)3O group. But 12*3 + 2*3 +16= 36+6+16=58.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula of the fragment is C3H7O. Let's calculate its mass: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. Total 60- no, 36+7+16=59. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe it's C2H5O. 24 +5 +16=45.

Ah! Yes! C2H5O has a molecular weight of 2*12 +5 +16=24+5+16=45.

So, a fragment with the formula C2H5O would have a mass of 45.

So, what structures have a C2H5O fragment? Maybe an ethoxy group (CH2CH2O), but that's C2H5O.

Wait, but an ethoxy group is (CH2CH3)O-. Its mass is 45. So if the compound has an ethoxy group, that would produce a fragment at 45.

So, if the compound is an ether, but that would need an O. Looking at the options, option C has two O's, so maybe it's an ester with an ethoxy group.

Wait, but esters are R-O-CO-R'. So the ethoxy group would contribute to the structure. For example, ethyl something-ate.

So, if the compound is ethyl something-ate with another O, perhaps.

Wait, but the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Let's imagine it's an ester: R-O-CO-R'. Suppose R is ethyl (C2H5) and R' is a four-carbon group.

Wait, but that would make the ester formula C2H5-O-CO-(C4H9?), but that would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

But option A has a molecular formula of C6H12O2. So, if the compound is ethyl something, perhaps ethyl cyclohexanoate would be C8H12O2, which is more than our options.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to make a decision based on the information.

The key points:

- O-H (from broad IR)
- Carbonyl (1700)
- Vinyl H (NMR)
- Fragment at 45.

So, the presence of O-H and carbonyl suggests a compound with both groups. The vinyl H suggests a double bond or aromatic ring.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. Which would have two O's and two DoU. So, perhaps a ring plus a double bond.

Wait, assuming the structure is an ester with an aromatic ring. But earlier, that didn't fit.

Wait, if the structure is an aromatic ester, like methyl benzoate, the formula would be C8H8O2, which doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexene with an ester substituent.

Wait, let me think about the molecular formula C6H10O2. It has two oxygens, two DoU.

So, possible structure: a cyclohexene ring (one DoU) with an ester group (O-CO-O, but that would add another DoU). Wait, but an ester group would contribute one DoU (the carbonyl). So, the ring and the ester give two DoU, which matches.

So, the structure could be something like cyclohexene with an ester substituent, such as methyl cyclohexenoate.

In that case, the IR would show an ester carbonyl (1700), the O-H from where? Wait, no O-H in that case. Hmm, but the FTIR shows a broad O-H. So that would conflict.

Wait, so maybe I'm missing something. The O-H would imply an -OH group. So perhaps the compound is an ester with an alcohol group.

Wait, but that's a bit conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diol with a carbonyl group, but that's stretching it.

Wait, another thought: the broad O-H could be from a phenol group. So, if the compound is a phenol ester, which would have a phenol O-H and an ester carbonyl. But with C6H10O2, the formula would require the phenol group and the ester group.

Wait, let's think: phenol is C6H5OH. If it's an ester of phenol, like phenyl acetate, the formula would be C6H5O2CCH3. That's C8H8O2, which again doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted phenol with an ester group.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The mass spec has a peak at 45, which we think is from a C2H5O fragment. So, perhaps the compound has an ethoxy group. Then, the molecular formula would have an ethoxy (C2H5O). So, for option C, C6H10O2: if one O is part of the ester (O-CO-O), and the other is part of an ethoxy group.

So, perhaps the structure is something like ethyl something-ate, where the R group is a four-carbon group. Wait, ethyl would contribute two carbons, so the rest would have four carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with an ethoxy group and a ketone, but that would complicate the DoU.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ethyl ester of a cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Wait, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid would be C6H10O2. So, its ethyl ester would be C8H12O2, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm, I think I'm going in circles. Let's try to think of each option's possible structure and see which fits.

Option C: C6H10O2.

If this is an ester, the structure could be, for example, methyl cyclopentanoate. But methyl cyclopentanoate is C7H10O2. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester and a double bond. Wait, that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that would require more oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. For example, cyclohexene with an ester substituent. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's compute how many H's are in an ester. An ester has the formula R-O-CO-R'. So the number of H's depends on R and R'.

But in any case, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2O- something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an alpha-hydroxy ester. For example, a structure like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2OH. But that would have more hydroxyl groups and perhaps a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a vinyl acetate. But vinyl acetate is C4H6O2, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an acrylic acid ester, but again, formula doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ortho ester, but that's getting too complex.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Let me try to think about which option would fit all the data.

The O-H in IR, the carbonyl, the vinyl H in NMR, and the fragment at 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2, which could be a ring and a double bond. Suppose the structure has an ester group (O-CO-O), a ring (like cyclohexane), and a double bond.

Wait, but then the O-H would come from where? Perhaps the compound is a diol with an ester group, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, the O-H could be a phenol group. But that would require a benzene ring, which would add DoU.

Wait, but benzene (C6H6) has three DoU. If the compound is a phenol derivative with an ester group, the formula would need to be C7H6O3 (like phenol acetate), but that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a substituted cyclohexene with an ester and an -OH group. For example, something like cyclohexene with a substituent that's an ester group and an -OH.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Another point: the 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. That suggests that the molecule has a double bond with adjacent protons. So perhaps a conjugated system.

Wait, another thought: the two carbonyl peaks in IR could be from a conjugated system. For example, an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The conjugated system could cause the carbonyl peak to shift to a lower wavenumber, like around 1650.

So, perhaps the structure is an enone, which has a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl group. The IR would then show a peak for the carbonyl at around 1700 and a peak for the conjugated double bond (C=C) at around 1650.

In that case, the structure would have a conjugated enone system, and an -OH group.

So, the compound could be something like cyclohexenone with a substituent that's an -OH group.

But then, the formula would have to include that.

Wait, cyclohexenone is C6H10O. Its molecular formula is C6H10O. That's option B. But option B has only one O.

Wait, but in our case, the compound has two O's because the IR shows a broad O-H (so another O), and a carbonyl (another O). So, the formula would need two O's. So, option C is C6H10O2.

So, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexenone with an -OH group. But cyclohexenone is C6H10O, adding an -OH would make it C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So, the structure would be something like 2-hydroxycyclohexenone. But wait, cyclohexenone has a ketone group (O), and adding an -OH (another O) would give two O's, which matches the formula C6H10O2.

In that case, the IR would show a broad O-H from the -OH group, a strong carbonyl (1700) from the ketone, and the conjugated double bond (1650). The NMR would show vinyl protons (the double bond in cyclohexenone), and the mass spec could have a fragment from the ketone or the -OH group, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a 45 peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond and an -OH group. For example, an allyl ester with an -OH.

But this is getting complicated, and I'm not making much progress. I think I need to make a decision based on the given data.

Putting it all together:

- O-H (broad) → -OH group.
- Carbonyl peaks → likely an ester or ketone.
- Vinyl H → double bond.
- Fragment at 45 → possibly an ethoxy group.

The options with two O's are A and C.

Option C: C6H10O2 with DoU 2. So, a ring and a double bond.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond, such as methyl cyclohexenoate, the formula would be C7H10O2, which is more than our options. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, the structure is a diester, but that would require more O's.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be from a CH3 group attached to something, but earlier calculation didn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass 45 is from the O-CO-O group breaking, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. I think I've thought about this enough, and I'm going to make a guess. The presence of two O's and the NMR data suggest an ester with a double bond. The mass 45 likely comes from an ethoxy group. So, the compound is an ethyl ester with a double bond.

Looking at the options, option C is C6H10O2. So, perhaps the structure is ethyl something-ate with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with an ethyl group and a double bond. So, the ethyl group would contribute 45 (C2H5O).

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.

The problem involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The key observations and reasoning are as follows:

### FTIR Analysis:
1. **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from an alcohol or phenol.
2. **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, such as an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
3. **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl group or an aromatic C=C stretch.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** suggest the presence of a double bond or an aromatic ring.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45**: Indicates a possible fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to a C₂H₅O group (e.g., an ethoxy group).

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
The degrees of unsaturation for each option are calculated as:
- **A) C₆H₁₂O₂**: DoU = 1 (one ring or one double bond).
- **B) C₆H₁₀O**: DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).
- **C) C₆H₁₀O₂**: DoU = 2 (one ring and one double bond or two double bonds).
- **D) C₆H₁₂O**: DoU = 1 (one ring or one double bond).

### Key Observations and Elimination:
1. The **broad O-H peak** and the presence of a carbonyl group suggest the compound contains both an -OH group and a carbonyl group.
2. The **vinyl hydrogens** in the NMR indicate the presence of a double bond or aromatic ring.
3. The **fragment at m/z = 45** suggests the presence of a C₂H₅O group, likely from an ethoxy group.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: This formula has only one degree of unsaturation, which does not account for the observed vinyl hydrogens or the two strong IR peaks.
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation but only one oxygen atom. It cannot account for the two IR peaks (one for O-H and one for a carbonyl group).
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: This formula has two degrees of unsaturation and two oxygen atoms, consistent with the presence of both an -OH group and a carbonyl group. The fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a C₂H₅O group, making this option plausible.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: This formula has only one degree of unsaturation and one oxygen atom, which does not match the IR data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is most consistent with **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**, as it accounts for the broad O-H peak, the carbonyl group, the vinyl hydrogens, and the fragment at m/z = 45.
