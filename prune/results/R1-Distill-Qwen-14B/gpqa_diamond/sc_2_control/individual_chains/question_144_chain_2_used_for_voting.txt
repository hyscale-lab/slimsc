Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a different value. 

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance of a particle is related to its lifetime. The formula I think I should use is the one involving the particle's lifetime (τ), its velocity (βc), and the decay length (L = βγcτ). Decay length is how far the particle travels before decaying on average.

Wait, okay, but how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should make sure about the units here.

Let me think. The width Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. Planck's constant ħ has units of GeV·s when converted properly. Let me get the values straight.

First, let's convert all units to a consistent system, maybe everything in SI units. 

The width Γ is 320 MeV. 1 MeV is 1e-3 GeV, so Γ = 0.32 GeV. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s. Let me calculate that.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = roughly 20.56875e-25 s. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds? Wait, wait, wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 is the same as 2.056875e-24 seconds. That makes sense.

Now, the decay length L is given by L = βγcτ. But wait, to find L, I need to find the velocity β of the meson X. Since X has a mass m_X =1.2 GeV, and its production energy E_X is 8 GeV, which is much higher than its rest mass.

In high-energy physics, when the energy E is much larger than the mass m, the relation E ≈ pc holds, where p is the momentum. So, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), but when E >> m c^2, then E ≈ pc. So, p ≈ E/c. 

But wait, actually, in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, energy, mass, and momentum are in the same units. So, when E >> m, p ≈ E. But let's think in SI units for clarity.

But perhaps it's easier to use natural units. Let's see. In natural units, c=1, so E (in GeV) is equal to m (GeV/c²) multiplied by c², but since c=1, E (GeV) is equal to m (GeV/c²) * c². Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think in terms of beta and gamma.

Beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). To find beta, perhaps I can use the fact that E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, in natural units, when E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps this is better represented differently.

Wait, let's get back. Since E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So E = gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, no: E is the total energy, which is gamma m c². So gamma = E/(m c²). But since I'm in natural units where c=1, perhaps it's gamma = E/(m). Wait, but units matter.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute beta using the energy. Let me think, in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), E = gamma m, and p = gamma beta m. So, the momentum p is given by p = gamma beta m. But from E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. Wait, perhaps in natural units, E² = p² + m². So, if E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, then p² = E² - m² = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So, gamma is E/(m c²) but c=1, so gamma = E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Beta is (p c)/(E) but c=1, so beta = p/E. Wait, since E is 8 GeV, p is about 7.91 GeV. So beta = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875.

So, gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. 

Wait, another approach: Since E = gamma m, gamma = E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So yes, that's correct.

So, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma)^2). Wait, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2). So, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma)^2)).

gamma is 8/(1.2) = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

So, beta = sqrt( 1 - (3/20)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, beta ≈ 0.9887. That's high, which makes sense because the energy is much higher than the mass.

So, putting it all together.

The lifetime tau is ħ / Γ. So, let me compute tau.

Wait, in natural units (ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s), and Γ is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV).

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, the decay length L is beta * gamma * c * tau.

But in natural units, c=1, so L = beta * gamma * tau * c. Wait, no, because in natural units, c is 1, but when converting to meters, we have to consider the actual speed of light.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute everything in SI units.

Let's recast it.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Beta is approximately 0.9887.

Gamma is approx 6.6667.

So, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Plugging in the numbers:

L = 0.9887 * 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.604.

Then, 3e8 m/s multiplied by 2.056875e-24 s gives:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875e-16 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

So, L = 6.604 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply 6.604 by 6.170625e-16.

6.604 * 6.170625 ≈ approximately 40.819.

So, 40.819e-16 meters is 4.0819e-15 meters.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, close to option B. Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error somewhere.

Let me recheck the numbers.

Let me compute tau again.

Tau = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV = 6.582e-25 /0.32 s.

6.582 /0.32 = 20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Gamma is E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c², so gamma=8/(1.2) = 6.666666... So correct.

Beta is calculated as sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma squared is (6.6666667)^2 = approx (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

So 1/gamma^2 is 9/400=0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. sqrt(0.9775)=approx 0.9887.

So beta is 0.9887.

So L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.604.

c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply 6.604 * 6.170625e-16 m.

6.604 *6.170625 = let me compute:

6 *6.170625=37.02375

0.604 *6.170625≈ 3.726.

Total 37.02375 +3.726=40.74975.

So 40.74975e-16 m = 4.074975e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.075e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5.02e-15. So 4.075e-15 is closest to option B, but perhaps I have made a miscalculation in the exact value.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact beta and gamma.

Let me compute gamma more accurately. Gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666667.

Beta squared is 1 - (1/(gamma^2)) = 1 - (1/(44.44444444)).

1/44.44444444 is 0.0225.

So beta squared is 0.9775, so beta is sqrt(0.9775) = 0.9887. Hmm, but perhaps more accurately, sqrt(0.9775) is about 0.98870557.

Now, let me compute the exact value.

Compute beta * gamma:

0.98870557 * 6.66666667 = ?

Let me compute 0.98870557 * 6 = 5.93223342.

0.98870557 * 0.66666667 ≈ 0.98870557 * (2/3) ≈ 0.659137. 

So total is approximately 5.93223342 +0.659137 = 6.59137.

So beta * gamma ≈ 6.59137.

Now, c * tau is 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

So L = 6.59137 * 6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.59137 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6 *6.170625 =37.02375.

0.59137 *6.170625.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.09137 *6.170625 = approx 0.5619.

So 0.59137 *6.170625 ≈3.0853 + 0.5619 = 3.6472.

Total 37.02375 +3.6472 ≈40.67095.

So 40.67095e-16 m =4.067095e-15 m.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So this is very close. Option D is 4.0655e-16 m, which is an order of magnitude smaller.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation of c * tau.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3 * 2.056875e-16 m = 6.170625e-16 m. Correct.

So, 6.59137 * 6.170625e-16 = ?

Wait, 6.59137 multiplied by 6.170625.

Wait, let me do this more accurately.

6 * 6.170625 = 37.02375.

0.59137 *6.170625:

Let me compute 0.5 *6.170625 =3.0853125.

0.09137 *6.170625 = let's compute 0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625 and 0.00137 *6.170625≈0.0084202.

So 0.55535625 +0.0084202≈0.563776.

So 0.59137 *6.170625 ≈3.0853125 +0.563776≈3.6490885.

So the total is 37.02375 +3.6490885=40.6728385.

So 40.6728385e-16 m → 4.06728e-15 m.

Which is 4.06728e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is really close.

Hmm, perhaps the approximations in beta and gamma were making it. Let me compute beta more accurately.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma = 8 /1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666666667.

gamma squared is (20/3)^2 =400/9 ≈44.4444444444.

So 1/(gamma^2)=9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775. sqrt(0.9775)=?

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775). Let me think: 0.9887² = ?

0.9887 *0.9887 → let me compute.

0.98 *0.98 =0.9604.

0.0087 *0.98 =0.008526.

0.98 *0.0087 =0.008526.

0.0087 *0.0087=0.00007569.

So cross terms: 2*(0.98 * 0.0087) = 2*0.008526=0.017052.

So (0.98 +0.0087)^2 ≈0.9604 + 0.017052 +0.00007569= about 0.97752769.

Which is close to 0.9775. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So beta is 0.9887, which gives us the calculation we did earlier.

So the decay length is approximately 4.067e-15 m, which is closest to option B (4.0655e-15 m).

Wait, but the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

So the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the lifetime of the particle, with \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s}}{0.32 \, \text{GeV}} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) and \( \beta \)
The energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and the mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Using the relativistic relation \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( \beta \) is calculated using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). First, compute \( \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \):

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{8}{1.2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 \approx 44.4444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} = \frac{1}{44.4444} \approx 0.0225.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
The decay length is:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau.
\]

Substitute the values:
- \( \beta \approx 0.9887 \),
- \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \).

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.6667 \approx 6.5914.
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = 6.5914 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)).

ANSWER: B
