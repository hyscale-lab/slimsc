Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my coordination chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the tendency of a metal ion to form complexes with ligands. Higher β means the complex is more stable. So, each β corresponds to a different complex.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^2- or something similar. Let's think: for Co(II), the complexes would have charges based on the number of SCN- ligands. Since each SCN- is -1, if n=1, the complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+; n=2 would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0, and so on. But I'm a bit confused about the exact charges, but maybe that's not crucial for finding the percentages.

The problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, so that's probably the [Co(SCN)₂] complex, which would be neutral. So, which β corresponds to that? Let me check the β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh, wait, β4 is 16. So, β4 is the stability constant for the complex with four SCN-? No, wait, usually β is the formation constant for the n-th complex. For example, β1 is for the first complex, [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)₂], etc. So in that case, the dithiocyanato complex is the β2=40 case.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, β3 is the highest, so that's likely the most stable complex, perhaps with three SCN- ligands. Hmm, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN- ions. So perhaps that's the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex, which would be β2=40.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about the correspondence. Let's think again. The stability constant for the first complex would be the formation of [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), β1=9. The second step would be adding another SCN- to form [Co(SCN)₂]^0, so the β2 would be the formation constant for that complex. Similarly, β3 is for [Co(SCN)3]^- and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2-. But wait, the β's given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, β4 is less than β3. That seems odd. Because the higher order complexes are sometimes less stable than lower ones, depending on the metal and ligand. So, in this case, the most stable is β3=63, then β2=40, then β1=9, and β4=16, which is lower than β2 and β3. Interesting.

But back to the problem. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So that's the species with two SCN per Co. So, its stability constant is β2=40.

Wait, but the question is about all cobalt-containing species. That includes all possible complexes and the free Co²+ ion. So, the total concentration of all Co species (free and complexed) is given as 1e-2 M.

Thiocyanate is in excess, 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M. That's much higher than the Co concentration, so we can assume that the concentration of SCN- doesn't change much upon complexation. So, we can approximate [SCN^-] as 0.1 M throughout.

So, the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible Co species (free Co²+ and each of the complexes) and then find the fraction that is the dithiocyanato complex.

The general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal to compute the fraction of each complex.

The formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [Co]_total * ([SCN]^{n}) ) / (1 + sum_{k=0}^{4} β_k * [SCN]^{k} )

Wait, no. Wait, I think the correct formula is:

Each possible complex contributes to the total, and the fraction is the contribution of each complex divided by the sum of all contributions plus the free metal.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the distribution of Co species given the total Co concentration and the ligand concentration.

Each species is:

- Co²+ (free)
- [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
- [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (n=2)
- [Co(SCN)3]^- (n=3)
- [Co(SCN)4]^2- (n=4)

Each of these can be considered as possible complexes, and the fractions are determined by their respective β's and the ligand and metal concentrations.

The fraction f_n of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [Co]_free * [SCN]^n) / D

where D is the denominator that sums all the possible terms (including the free metal as the n=0 case, which would have β_0 = 1, but only if we're considering formation from the free ion. Wait, no. Because [Co] is the free ion, which is Co²+.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants. But that could get complicated because each β is for the step of adding a ligand.

Alternatively, the overall formation constant for each complex can be considered. Let me think. The overall β for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} would be the product of the stepwise β's. For example, β_total for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1 * β2. Because the first step is adding one SCN to Co²+ to form [CoSCN]^+, which has β1=9. The second step is adding another SCN^- to form [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which has β2=40. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is 9 * 40 = 360.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)3]^- , the overall β is β1 * β2 * β3 = 9 *40 *63 = let's calculate that. 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. And for [Co(SCN)4]^2- the overall β would be β1*β2*β3*β4= 9*40*63*16. Let's compute that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16=362880.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the correct way to compute the overall β. Because each β is the stepwise constant, so for each additional SCN, the overall β is multiplied by the next β. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of β1 through βn.

So, for n=2, β_total is β1 * β2 = 9 *40 = 360.

Similarly, β_total for n=3 is 9*40*63 = 22680.

n=4: 9*40*63*16=362880.

But wait, the free Co²+ is the n=0 case, which has β0=1, but that's included as the first term in the denominator.

So, the general formula for the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_total,n * [SCN]^n * c_total) / (sum_{k=0}^{4} β_total,k * [SCN]^k )

Where c_total is the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

Wait, but [SCN] is 0.1 M.

So, let's compute each β_total for each n.

n=0: [Co²+], β_total=1.

n=1: [CoSCN]^+, β_total=9.

n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β_total=9*40=360.

n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^- , β_total=9*40*63=22680.

n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^2- , β_total=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but wait. Are the stepwise β's cumulative? That is, to form [Co(SCN)₂], each step adds a ligand, so the overall β is indeed the product of β1 and β2.

So, now, the denominator D would be the sum of all possible β_total * [SCN]^n, for n=0 to 4.

Wait, but what about the free Co²+? That's the n=0 case, with β_total=1.

So, D = sum_{n=0}^4 (β_total,n * [SCN]^n )

So, let's calculate each term.

Compute [SCN]^n for n=0 to 4:

[SCN]^0 = 1

n=1: 0.1

n=2: 0.1^2 = 0.01

n=3: 0.1^3 = 0.001

n=4: 0.1^4 = 0.0001

Now, for each n, compute β_total * [SCN]^n.

n=0: β=1, [SCN]^0=1 → 1*1=1.

n=1: β=9, [SCN]^1=0.1 → 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: β=360, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

n=3: β=22680, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

n=4: β=362880, [SCN]^4=0.0001 → 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So, sum each of these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 3.6 = 5.5

5.5 + 22.68 = 28.18

28.18 + 36.288 = 64.468.

So D ≈ 64.468.

So, the fractions for each species are:

f_n = (β_total,n * [SCN]^n) / D.

Wait, but wait. Because the total cobalt concentration is c_total = 1e-2 M, and each complex's concentration can be calculated as f_n * c_total.

Because the denominator is D, which is sum of (β_total,n * [SCN]^n ), and each term is (β_total,n * [SCN]^n ) / D, which gives the fraction of each species.

Wait, but let's think again. The fraction of each species is [Co_species] / c_total.

So, [Co_species] = f_n * c_total.

So, for each n, [Co_species] = (β_total,n * (SCN)^n ) / D * c_total.

So, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) is [Co(SCN)₂]^0 / c_total, which is (360 * 0.01) / D.

Wait, but D was 64.468, which is 64.468.

So, [Co(SCN)₂]^0 = (360 * 0.01) / 64.468 * 1e-2.

Wait, wait, no. Because D is the sum, and each [Co_species] is (β_total,n * (SCN)^n ) / D multiplied by c_total.

So the fraction of n=2 is (360 * 0.01) / (64.468) → 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556, or about 5.556%.

Wait, that's about 5.56%, but looking at the options, the closest is D) 16.9%, which is way higher. Hmm, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I got the β's wrong. Let me double-check. The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So perhaps β4 is for the fourth complex. So if these are the sequential β's, then the overall β for each complex is the product up to that point.

But wait, perhaps the problem is that the stability constants are given as the overall formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones. That would change everything. Because if β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)₂]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^- , etc., then the overall β for each is given. So, n=1: β=9, n=2: β=40, n=3: β=63, n=4: β=16.

Wait, that's a different approach. Because in that case, each β is already the overall constant for the complex with n ligands.

So, for example, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+ is β1=9.

The formation constant for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is β2=40.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the overall β for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 would be β1 * β2, not β2. So the given β's must be the stepwise constants.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused now. Let me look for another approach. Maybe using the distribution of the species based on the given β's as stepwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each β represents the overall stability constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise. So, for example, β for [Co(SCN)]^+ is 9, for [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is 40, etc.

But that doesn't make much sense because usually, stepwise β's are given. So perhaps I should proceed with the overall β approach.

Wait, let me try that. If each β is the overall formation constant for the nth complex (i.e., β1 corresponds to [CoSCN]^+, β2 to [Co(SCN)₂]^0, etc.), then the fractions can be calculated as:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k * [SCN]^k )

But wait, for n=0, it's [Co²+] with β0=1.

So, let's compute each term again.

n=0: β=1, [SCN]^0=1 → 1*1=1.

n=1: β=9, [SCN]^1=0.1 → 9*0.1=0.9.

n=2: β=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 → 40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: β=63, [SCN]^3=0.001 → 63*0.001=0.063.

n=4: β=16, [SCN]^4=0.0001 → 16 * 0.0001=0.0016.

Now, sum all these:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+ 0.4 → 2.3

+0.063 → 2.363

+0.0016 →2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. That matches option D.

Wait, but that's the percentage for the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 complex. But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which would be this [Co(SCN)₂]^0, so it would be 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought the β's were stepwise, but when I considered them as overall, it gave a valid option. So perhaps the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So the fractions are calculated as [β_n [SCN]^n ] divided by the sum of all terms.

But why would the problem give β1=9, β2=40, etc., as overall constants? Because that would make more sense for this calculation.

So, based on this approach, the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and assume they represent the overall stability constants for the respective complexes. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Species**:  
   The fraction \( f_n \) of the cobalt species with \( n \) thiocyanato ligands is given by:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k \cdot [\text{SCN}]^k}
   \]  
   Here, \( \beta_0 = 1 \) corresponds to the free Co²⁺ ion.

2. **Compute Terms for Each \( n \)**:  
   Using \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \), calculate \( \beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}]^n \) for \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \):  
   - \( n = 0 \): \( \beta_0 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)  
   - \( n = 1 \): \( \beta_1 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)  
   - \( n = 2 \): \( \beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)  
   - \( n = 3 \): \( \beta_3 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)  
   - \( n = 4 \): \( \beta_4 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

3. **Sum of Terms**:  
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

4. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex (\( n = 2 \)) is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 \cdot [\text{SCN}]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰**:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = f_2 \cdot 100 = 0.169 \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.
