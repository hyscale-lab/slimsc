Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective field theories are used when you have some high-energy physics that you can't see directly, so you write down all possible interactions consistent with some symmetry.

The question is asking which symmetries operators in the SMEFT must respect. The options are 1 to 4, and the choices are A to D. Let's look at each symmetry.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think this is definitely a big one. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, so any effective theory derived from it should also respect Lorentz symmetry. Operators in SMEFT must form Lorentz scalars, meaning their tensor structures have to be invariant under Lorentz transformations. So I'm pretty sure Lorentz symmetry is required.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, if the theory is Lorentz invariant, it's automatically Poincare invariant if it's also translationally invariant. But SMEFT is a low-energy theory, so I think it's formulated in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. Or wait, maybe not necessarily. Because SMEFT is built as an effective theory, which includes all possible terms that are allowed by the underlying symmetries. So if the underlying theory (like the Standard Model) has Poincare symmetry, then the effective theory should respect it too. So I think Poincare is also a must.

3. CP Symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So in SMEFT, operators can violate CP. For example, certain dimension-6 operators involve terms that aren't CP invariant. So I don't think CP is a symmetry that all SMEFT operators must respect. Some operators might violate CP, so it's not a must for all.

4. CPT Symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, Time reversal. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory derived from the Standard Model, it should also respect CPT. So all operators in SMEFT must be CPT invariant. Wait, but wait—do they? Because in some cases, if you have higher-dimensional operators, could they break CPT? Or are they constructed in a way that CPT is preserved? I think that in the SMEFT framework, the operators are constructed to be renormalizable, and since the SM respects CPT, the SMEFT operators should also respect it. So CPT symmetry is respected, meaning all operators must conserve it.

So putting it together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

- Lorentz (1): Yes
- Poincare (2): Yes, because it's part of the framework
- CP (3): No, because SMEFT allows CP violation
- CPT (4): Yes, because the theory must respect it.

So the symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C says 1,2,4. Option C is option C) 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but wait another thing: Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes translations. Let me think. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, which is valid below a certain scale. In such a theory, you can have nonrenormalizable operators, but the Poincare symmetry is about the spacetime translations. Do the SMEFT operators necessarily respect that?

Wait, the Lagrangian in the SMEFT is constructed as part of the effective theory, which is Poincare invariant because it's just adding higher-dimension terms to the Standard Model, which is itself Poincare invariant. So the effective operators must also be Poincare invariant. Because the SM is Poincare, and the SMEFT adds terms that are compatible with that. So yes, Poincare is a must.

So the correct answer is options 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which forms its foundation. To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, let us analyze each option:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is built as an effective theory that respects Lorentz symmetry. Operators in SMEFT must form Lorentz scalars, ensuring that Lorentz symmetry is preserved. Thus, Lorentz symmetry is a must.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translational invariance. Since SMEFT is derived from the Standard Model, which respects Poincaré symmetry, and the effective operators are constructed to be compatible with this symmetry, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not respect CP symmetry due to CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT allows operators that violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, as an effective theory derived from it, must also respect CPT symmetry. All operators in SMEFT are constructed to preserve CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
