Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest energy state. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy states of a molecule can be modeled using different approximations—like the rigid rotor for rotation and the simple harmonic oscillator for vibration. But wait, the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe it's considering some flexibility or maybe the bond length isn't perfectly fixed. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects this particular problem.

The goal is to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will cause the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So we're looking for a transition from the current state to the next higher energy state.

Given data:
- Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu
- Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu
- Bond length (R) = 2 angstroms
- Angular frequency (w) = 4e14 rad/s

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. In the quantum mechanical treatment, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies.

In the fundamental state, the molecule is in its lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, for a diatomic molecule, the rigid rotor model starts at J=0, but sometimes the ground state might have J=1. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I think for the rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0, but for a symmetric rotor, certain states are degenerate. Oh wait, diatomic is linear, so J=0 is possible. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0.

So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher state. The next state would be the next higher energy state, which could involve either an increase in vibrational state or rotational state. But which transition is the lowest in energy? Because the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the energy for a diatomic molecule in rotation-vibration model is given by:

E = E_vibrational + E_rotational

The vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational energy levels are (J (J+1) h² ) / (8 π² I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the total energy is the sum of these two. Now, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0, and J=0. So E_initial = (0 + 1/2) h w + (0 * 1 h²)/(8 π² I) ?

Wait, no: for J=0, the rotational energy is (0)(0+1) * ... which is zero. So E_initial = (0 + 1/2) h w.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the next higher energy state. That could be either increasing J (rotational excitation) or increasing n (vibrational excitation). Which of these transitions requires less energy?

The vibrational energy gap between v=0 and v=1 is h w. The rotational energy for J=0 to J=1: the energy for J=1 is (1)(2) h²/(8 π² I) = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I). So the rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = [ (1)(1+1) ] [h²/(8 π² I) ] = (2 h²)/(8 π² I) ) = h²/(4 π² I).

So which is smaller: h w or h²/(4 π² I)?

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, and we need to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state should have the smallest possible energy increment. Therefore, the photon should be tuned to the transition that requires the least energy.

So we should calculate the energy difference for both possible transitions and pick the smaller one.

Let me compute both.

First, compute the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (22 amu) = (40) /22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, amu is the atomic mass unit, which is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = (20*2)/(22) amu = (40/22) amu = 1.818... amu.

So μ = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert this into kg. So μ = (20 * 2)/(22) amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu.

Alternatively, μ can be calculated in kg.

Wait, let's compute μ:

Mx = 20 amu =20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (3.32e-26 kg * 3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 kg )

Wait, wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator correctly.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, so 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

My is 2 amu: 2 *1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27).

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 kg² ≈ 10.9984e-53 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26(1 + 0.1) = 3.32e-26 * 1.1 ≈ 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = (10.9984e-53) / (3.652e-26) kg ≈ (10.9984 / 3.652) * 1e-27 kg ≈ approximately 3 * 1e-27 kg, but let me compute it more accurately.

Hmm, 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26.

So μ = 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 / (3.652e-26) kg.

Wait, wait, no: numerator is 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32 *3.32) * 1e-53 = 11.0224e-53.

So 11.0224e-53 / 3.652e-26 = (11.0224 /3.652) * 1e-27.

11.0224 /3.652 ≈ 3.

Wait, 3.652 * 3=10.956, which is close to 11.0224. So it's approximately 3.016 * 1e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So the moment of inertia I = μ R² = (3.016e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =12.064e-47 kg m² ≈ 1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational energy for J=0 is zero, and for J=1 is (1)(2) h²/(8 π² I) = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

Wait, the general formula for rotational energy levels is E_rot = [J (J+1) h² ] / (8 π² I ), so for J=1, E_rot = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

So the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = h²/(4 π² I).

Let me compute this value.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J s.

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Plugging into E_rot(J=1):

E_rot = (4.39e-67) / (4 * π² * 1.2064e-46 )

Compute denominator: 4 * π² ≈ 39.4784. So denominator is 39.4784 * 1.2064e-46 ≈ 47.63e-46.

Wait, 39.4784 *1.2064= approx 39.4784 *1.2 =47.374, so 47.374e-46.

So E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 47.374e-46 ≈ (4.39 /47.374) * 1e-21 J.

4.39 /47.374 ≈ 0.0927. So E_rot ≈ 0.0927e-21 J = 9.27e-23 J.

Wait, that's the rotational energy difference.

Now, the vibrational energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vibr = h w.

h is 6.626e-34 J s, w is 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vibr =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So comparing the two, ΔE_rot is about 9.27e-23 J, and ΔE_vibr is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy.

Since the problem asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy, the molecule would transition via the rotational state, as that requires a lower energy photon.

Wait, but wait: the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it can either go to the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. The transition that requires the least energy would be the rotational one, so the photon's energy should match the rotational energy difference.

But wait, I'm assuming that the molecule is in J=0, v=0. So the next possible state could be either J=1, v=0 or J=0, v=1. So the question is which of these is lower in energy.

As ΔE_rot is 9.27e-23 J, and ΔE_vibr is 2.65e-19 J, so the rotational transition is much lower in energy. Therefore, the photon should have energy corresponding to the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait: the energy difference for vibrational is much higher. So the photon's energy should be the smaller one, the rotational one.

So the momentum of the photon can be found using E = hf = p c / λ, but perhaps better to use E = p c, since for a photon, E = p c, where p is momentum. Because for a photon, the energy is E = pc, since for photons, m=0, so E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 → E=pc.

Wait, no. Let me think: the energy of a photon is E = h f, and the momentum p is E / c. So yes, p = E / c.

So since the required energy is ΔE_rot = 9.27e-23 J, the momentum p is (9.27e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 3.09e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but wait: let's compute it more accurately.

ΔE_rot = h²/(4 π² I)

But let me compute it again more precisely.

h =6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, since it's defined now)

But perhaps I can use exact numbers for a more precise calculation.

Wait, let's re-calculate I precisely.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2) /22 =40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.8181818 amu.

Convert μ to kg:

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 *2)/(22) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg = (40/22) * 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.8181818.

So μ =1.8181818 *1.66053906660e-27 kg ≈ (1.8181818) *1.6605390666e-27.

Let me compute that:

1.8181818 *1.6605390666e-27 ≈ approx 3.015e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² =3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.015e-27 *4e-20 =1.206e-46 kg m².

Now, compute E_rot = h²/(4 π² I).

h² = (6.62607015e-34)^2 ≈4.39047e-67 J² s².

So E_rot =4.39047e-67 / (4 * π² *1.206e-46 )

Compute denominator: 4 * π² ≈39.4784, so 39.4784 *1.206e-46 =47.6e-46.

Now, E_rot =4.39047e-67 /47.6e-46 =4.39047e-67 /4.76e-45.

Which is approximately (4.39047 /4.76) *1e-22 J ≈0.922 *1e-22 J =9.22e-23 J.

So E_rot is approximately 9.22e-23 J.

Now, the energy of the photon should match this E_rot.

Photon energy E = h f = p c, so p = E /c.

c ≈3e8 m/s.

So p =9.22e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.073e-31 kg m/s.

But let me compute it more accurately.

E_rot =9.22e-23 J.

p = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = (9.22 /3) *1e-31 kg m/s ≈3.073e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are in the 1e-31 range. Let me look at the options:

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, the momentum is in Ns (which is kg m/s). So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options are all around 1e-27 to 2e-27, which is much larger.

Hmm, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the moment of inertia. Because the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So I = μ R².

μ is (20 * 2)/(20+2) amu = (40)/(22) amu =20/11 amu ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ=1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approximately 3.015e-27 kg. Correct.

R²=(2e-10)^2=4e-20 m². Correct.

I=3.015e-27 *4e-20=1.206e-46 kg m². Correct.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s². Correct.

E_rot = h²/(4 π² I) =4.39e-67 / (4 * pi^2 *1.206e-46) =4.39e-67 / (4*9.8696 *1.206e-46 )

Wait, 4 pi^2 is about 39.478, as before.

So denominator is 39.478 * 1.206e-46 ≈47.64e-46.

So E_rot =4.39e-67 /47.64e-46 = (4.39 /47.64) *1e-21 J ≈0.0922 *1e-21 J =9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's energy should be 9.22e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c =9.22e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s =3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are all in the ~1e-27 Ns range. So I'm getting a value that's four orders of magnitude smaller.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia.

Wait, another thought: Did the problem mention the non-rigid rotor model? Oh, maybe the bond length isn't fixed, but in our calculation, we used R=2 angstroms, which is fixed. Wait, but the non-rigid rotor model is different. Oh, wait, the non-rigid rotor model (also called the "rotating dumbbell" model) allows for stretching and compression of the bond. But wait, in that model, the moment of inertia is not fixed because the bond length can vary. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we're still considering the bond length as given since the problem provides R.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects using the vibration energy and not the rotation.

Wait, but the rotational energy is much lower, so the photon's energy for rotation is lower. So why the options are so much larger?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = [J (J+1) h² ] / (8 π² I).

So for J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is ΔE = E(1) - E(0) = [2 h²/(8 π² I) ] = h²/(4 π² I).

Wait, is that correct?

Yes, because E(0)=0, E(1)= (1*2) h²/(8 π² I) = 2 h²/(8 π² I) = h²/(4 π² I).

So that part is correct.

Another possibility: Maybe the problem isn't considering the rotational transition but only the vibrational transition. Because sometimes in such models, the fundamental state is considered as the combination of vibrational and rotational states, and the next state could be the first vibrational state regardless of rotation.

But wait, because the vibrational energy is much higher, but maybe the question is only about the vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state with the lowest possible energy after the fundamental state would be the one with the smallest possible energy increment.

Wait, but the rotational transition gives a much lower energy, so the molecule would prefer that transition. So why the options don't have a value around 3e-31 Ns?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says the photon's momentum is needed. Momentum p = E/c.

E is 9.22e-23 J.

p = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation for I. Let me try computing I again.

Wait, another approach: Compute I in terms of R² and the reduced mass in atomic mass units.

I = μ R². μ is in kg, R is in meters.

Wait, maybe I should compute I again.

μ = (20 *2) / (20+2) amu =40/22 amu =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.015e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I =3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.015e-27 *4e-20 =1.206e-46 kg m².

Yes, correct.

Hmmm, perhaps the problem is not using the non-rigid rotor model, but the rigid rotor model, but even then, the moment of inertia is fixed.

Wait, but the bond length is given, so I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy transition, even though it's larger. Maybe the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

That would be E = h w.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.835e-28 kg m/s=8.835e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, which is roughly half of 8e-28.

Hmm, so that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the energy is E = ħ ω, where ħ is h/(2 pi). Because sometimes in quantum mechanics, the energy is expressed in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n +1/2) h w.

So the transition from n=0 to n=1 is ΔE = h w.

So that's correct. So E_photon = h w.

But according to that, the photon's energy is 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Momentum p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, and option A is 1.9e-28.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is close to option D (1.4e-28) but off by a factor of about 6.3.

Wait, that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next state as the first excited state, regardless of which transition it is. So the next state might be the first rotational state or the first vibrational state, whichever comes first. But the energy required for the rotational transition is much smaller. So why is the answer not matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule being in the ground vibrational state but the lowest rotational state which is J=1, and the next state is J=2 or v=1.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the ground state is J=0. So the next rotational state is J=1, which requires much less energy than the vibrational transition. So why the answer isn't matching any option.

Unless I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the rotational energy.

Let me compute h²/(4 pi² I) again.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

h²= (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

I=1.206e-46 kg m².

So 4 pi² I =4*(pi^2)*1.206e-46 =4*9.8696*1.206e-46.

4*9.8696≈39.478.

39.478 *1.206e-46 =47.6e-46.

So denominator is 47.6e-46.

E_rot =4.39e-67 /47.6e-46 = (4.39 /47.6) ) * 1e-67 +46 = (0.0922) * 1e-21 =9.22e-23 J.

So that's correct.

So p =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s=3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have anything near that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy in terms of the rotational constant.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = h²/(8 pi² I c), where c is speed of light? No, wait, B is generally expressed in cm^-1 as B = h/(8 pi² c I), but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the rotational energy levels can be expressed in terms of the rotational constant B, where E = B J (J+1).

But B is usually given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but perhaps using energy units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem doesn't require the consideration of both rotation and vibration, but only considers the rotational transition because the molecule is in its fundamental (v=0) state, and the next state would be a rotational state.

Wait, but the options don't align with that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, maybe the question is about the transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes, but that seems unlikely because the problem states "the next state with the lowest possible energy".

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is in a state where both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers are non-zero. But no, in the fundamental state, it's v=0 and J=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct transition is the first vibrational state, and the rotational energy is not considered. But why?

Wait, perhaps the energy levels are such that the next state is a vibrational state, perhaps because the rotational transition is forbidden or not allowed. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only the vibrational transition, despite the higher energy.

If that's the case, then E_photon= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.65e-19/3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D:1.4e-28, option A:1.9e-28.

But 8.8e-28 is between options A and D. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation of E_rot.

Wait, maybe I should use the vibrational energy as the transition.

Wait, E_vibrational = (1/2) h w.

Wait, no: the energy levels are (n +1/2) h w. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 is h w.

So E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Wait, but why isn't this matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is given as the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies. But that would be even higher, which is not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the vibration energy but with a different formula.

Wait, let's compute E_vibrational.

E_vib = (n +1/2) h w.

n=0 → E= (0.5) h w.

n=1 → E= (1.5) h w.

So ΔE = 1 h w.

Which is correct.

So E_photon = h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options: option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So none of the options match.

Hmm, this is confusing. Because according to the calculations, the rotational transition requires lower energy, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule's transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires E_photon= h w=2.65e-19 J, which gives p=8.83e-28 Ns.

But no option is matching this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in angstroms, but I used meters correctly. Let me confirm:

Yes, R=2 angstroms=2e-10 meters.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the non-rigid rotor, which allows for vibrational changes. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is referring to the transition in the vibration-rotation spectrum, where the molecule can change both vibrational and rotational states. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the state with the lowest rotational state (J=0) and lowest vibrational state (v=0), and the next possible state is v=1, J=0. So the energy required is h w.

So E_photon= h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=8.83e-28 Ns.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28 and D:1.4e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, h=6.626e-34 Js, w=4e14 rad/s.

So E=6.626e-34 *4e14= (6.626 *4)e-20=26.504e-20=2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

So p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is approximately 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the rotational transition, but the calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the rotational energy.

Wait, another approach: What's the formula for the rotational energy in terms of angular momentum?

E_rot = L²/(2I), where L is angular momentum.

But L = I ω, so E_rot = I² ω²/(2I) )= (I ω² )/2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given by E = ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency. So ω_rot = sqrt( k / I ), where k is the rotational constant. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I k), where k is the rotational constant in terms of energy.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the vibrational transition, and perhaps the options are presented with a miscalculation.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B)2.3e-27 Ns

C)1.1e-27 Ns

D)1.4e-28 Ns.

So none match 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest would be option A (1.9e-28) if I have a mistake of factor ~4.6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the bond length. Wait, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is in meters, but I used angstroms. No, no—bond length is given as 2 angstroms, so it's 2e-10 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating μ. Let's recheck.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 amu ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is referring to the vibrational energy transition, but the photon's energy is expressed as p c, but perhaps in a different unit.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum in a different unit, but that's unlikely. The options are in Ns, which is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor but with a different approach. Let me think about the rigid rotor model.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = (J (J+1) h² )/(8 π² I ), where I is the moment of inertia. The spacing between adjacent levels is E(J+1) - E(J) = [ h² (2J +1) ]/(8 π² I ), which for J=0 → J=1 is E= h²/(8 π² I ) *2 (J+1)=2 *1 (so 2*1=2) → E= (2 h²)/(8 π² I )= h²/(4 π² I ), which matches what I had earlier.

So E_rot=9.22e-23 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question switched the mass values. Let me check the given masses again.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ=(20*2)/(22)=40/22.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of p.

Wait, E_rot=9.22e-23 J.

p=E/c=9.22e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps the problem is referring to a different model, such as the diatomic molecule only considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy but using the reduced mass in a different way.

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Let me check the options again.

The options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

So, the only way for the calculation to fit is if the rotational energy is being considered but the calculation is wrong by a factor.

Wait, maybe the bond length is given in meters, and I treated it as angstroms. No, because the bond length is given as 2 angstroms.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is 2e-10 m, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the rotational energy in another way. Let me think of the rotational energy as ħ ω_rot, where ω_rot is the angular frequency for rotation.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_J = ħ ω_rot J (J+1).

But where ω_rot = sqrt( k / I ), with k being the rotational constant.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is given by E_rot = (1/2) I ω², where ω is the angular velocity.

But without knowing ω, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, but then why the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon's momentum is to be calculated using the vibrational transition, but I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the vibrational photon momentum.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E_photon /c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s=8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this value.

Wait, let me recheck h and w.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

Yes, correct.

So E=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

So around 8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the problem expects the rotational transition, but the options have a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a point mass undergoing vibration, and the momentum is related to the vibrational motion.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule's vibration is modeled as a particle in a harmonic oscillator. So the energy levels are E_n = (n + 1/2) h w.

The transition from n=0 to n=1 requires energy E = h w.

So the photon's energy is E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the problem statement again.

The problem says it's a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, maybe the non-rigid rotor model allows for bond length fluctuations, which would mean that the moment of inertia isn't fixed. But for the purpose of calculating the transition, perhaps we still use the rigid rotor approximation with the given R.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model is being considered, and the moment of inertia is different.

But I'm not familiar with the exact treatment of the non-rigid rotor model for this purpose. The rigid rotor model seems more straightforward for this calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing rotational and vibrational energies.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is in the (v=0, J=0) state, and the next state is (v=1, J=0), which is a vibrational transition. But that requires E= h w.

But if the rotational transition (v=0, J=1) is possible and of lower energy, then why the options don't match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first state with higher energy, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration. So the energy required would be the minimum between the two transitions.

But I've already calculated that the rotational transition is much lower in energy.

So, given that, the correct photon momentum would be about 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be calculated using the reduced mass and the bond length in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the change in the molecule's linear momentum due to the photon's impact, but that's not correct because the photon's momentum is what causes the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum as the change in the molecule's translational momentum, but that's unrelated to the internal states.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, and perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational energy.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy again using the formula E_rot = h c B, where B is the rotational constant in cm^-1.

But B is given by B = h/(8 pi^2 c I).

Wait, but perhaps I can compute B.

I =1.206e-46 kg m².

c =3e8 m/s.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

So B = h/(8 pi² c I ) =6.626e-34/(8 * pi² *3e8 *1.206e-46).

Let me compute denominator:

8 * pi² ≈78.9568.

So denominator =78.9568 *3e8 *1.206e-46.

Compute 78.9568 *3e8 =2.3687e10.

Multiply by 1.206e-46: 2.3687e10 *1.206e-46 =2.856e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 /2.856e-36 ≈23.19 cm^-1.

So E_rot = h c B.

h c =1240 eV nm.

But B is in cm^-1, so E_rot (in Joules) is h c B (in cm^-1), but units might be tricky.

Wait, B is in cm^-1, so E_rot = h c B.

But h c is 1240 eV nm.

Wait, 1 eV=1.602e-19 J.

But perhaps better to compute E_rot in J.

E_rot = h c B =6.626e-34 J s *3e8 m/s *23.19 cm^-1.

But wait, 1 cm =0.01 m, so 1 cm^-1 =100 m^-1.

So 23.19 cm^-1 =2319 m^-1.

So E_rot =6.626e-34 *3e8 *2319.

Wait, 3e8 *2319 =6.957e11.

6.626e-34 *6.957e11 =4.6e-22 J.

So E_rot =4.6e-22 J.

Wait, but earlier calculation using the rotational energy formula gave E_rot=9.22e-23 J.

So this is a discrepancy. So perhaps there's a mistake in the B calculation.

Wait, B is defined as h/(8 pi² c I ), which is in cm^-1.

Hmm, perhaps the calculation of B is correct.

Wait, let me compute h/(8 pi² c I ):

h=6.626e-34 J s.

8 pi² c I =8 * (pi^2) *3e8 m/s *1.206e-46 kg m².

Compute step by step:

8 pi² ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 =2.3687e10.

Multiply by I (1.206e-46): 2.3687e10 *1.206e-46 =2.856e-36.

So B =6.626e-34 /2.856e-36 =approx 23.19 cm^-1.

So E_rot = h c B =6.626e-34 *3e8 *23.19.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 23.19:1.9878e-25 *23.19 ≈4.6e-24 J.

Wait, that's different from the earlier calculation of 9.22e-23 J.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps my earlier approach was wrong, and this approach gives E_rot=4.6e-24 J.

But then, p= E/c=4.6e-24 /3e8=1.53e-32 kg m/s=1.53e-32 Ns.

But that's even smaller than before.

This is getting more confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should give up and pick the option that matches the vibrational transition, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for the rotational energy.

Wait, I've calculated E_rot as 9.22e-23 J, which is in the 1e-23 J range. But the options are in the 1e-27 Ns range, which is 1e-27 kg m/s. Let me see if there's a way to get from 9.22e-23 J to 1e-27 kg m/s.

Wait, 9.22e-23 J =9.22e-23 kg m²/s².

p = E/c =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

So 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the change in the molecule's linear momentum upon absorbing the photon, but that's unrelated to the internal state transition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reduced mass in a different way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's entire mass, not the reduced mass.

Wait, the molecule's total mass is Mx + My =22 amu.

But that would make the moment of inertia I=(Mx + My) R², which is I=22 amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

But that would be I=22 *4e-20 *1.66e-27 kg.

Wait, that would be way larger, which would make the rotational energy lower, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's compute that.

M_total =22 amu =22 *1.66e-27 kg ≈3.652e-26 kg.

I = M_total * R² =3.652e-26 kg *4e-20 m² =1.46e-45 kg m².

Then, E_rot = h²/(4 pi² I )= (6.626e-34)^2/(4 pi² *1.46e-45 )

h²=4.39e-67.

4 pi² =39.478.

So denominator=39.478 *1.46e-45 ≈57.5e-45.

E_rot=4.39e-67 /57.5e-45 = (4.39/57.5) *1e-22 ≈0.0765e-22=7.65e-24 J.

p=7.65e-24/3e8=2.55e-32 Ns.

Still way off.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the next state is a vibrational transition, despite the higher energy, as the rotational transition's momentum is not among the options.

If the rotational transition requires 3e-31 Ns and it's not an option, perhaps the question expects the vibrational transition, which gives 8.8e-28 Ns, but that's also not an option. However, looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly a factor of 4.6 less than 8.8e-28.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w. Let me recheck.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8=8.8347e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the vibrational energy but with a different frequency, like the first overtone.

But the question states the next state, which would be the first vibrational transition (n=0→n=1), not the first overtone (n=0→n=2).

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to match the rotational transition, but the calculation is done incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy using the formula E_rot = (J (J+1) h c B ), where B is the rotational constant in cm^-1.

Earlier, I calculated B=23.19 cm^-1.

So for J=0→1, ΔE = (2 h c B)/2 → h c B * (1) →23.19 cm^-1 → which is in wavenumbers.

But converting that to energy: E= h c (cm^-1).

But 1 cm^-1 = (h c)/1 cm.

Wait, E= h c * cm^-1.

Wait, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to E= h c / (1 cm) =6.626e-34 *3e8 /0.01 =1.9878e-23 J.

So 23.19 cm^-1 is 23.19 *1.9878e-23 J=4.61e-22 J.

So E_photon=4.61e-22 J.

p=E/c=4.61e-22 /3e8=1.537e-30 kg m/s=1.537e-30 Ns.

Again, not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the vibrational transition, and the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think of the photon's momentum as p = h/(lambda).

But lambda = c/f, and f = w/(2 pi), since E= h f = h w/(2 pi).

Wait, perhaps that's where the confusion is.

Wait, no, because E = h f = h (w/(2 pi)).

So E = h w/(2 pi).

So p= E/c = (h w)/(2 pi c).

Wait, that's a possibility.

So let's compute p using this.

h=6.626e-34.

w=4e14.

So E=6.626e-34 *4e14 / (2 pi) = (2.65e-19) /6.283 ≈4.21e-19 J.

p=4.21e-19 /3e8 =1.403e-27 kg m/s=1.403e-27 Ns.

Ah! That's close to option C (1.1e-27) and option B (2.3e-27), but closer to option D:1.4e-28 (but that's one order lower).

Wait, 1.4e-27 is option B, but I got 1.4e-27.

Wait, wait, calculation again:

E = h w/(2 pi) → E = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/(2 pi) = (2.6504e-19) /6.283 ≈4.21e-19 J.

p=E/c=4.21e-19 /3e8=1.403e-27 kg m/s=1.403e-27 Ns.

So that's approximately 1.4e-27 Ns.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.3e-27, option C is 1.1e-27, and option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, 1.4e-27 is not exactly any of the options, but option B is higher, and option C is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Because the photon's energy is E = h f, and f= w/(2 pi). So E = h w/(2 pi) → correct.

So why is this approach giving me 1.4e-27, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the rotational energy, but I'm getting lost.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

If the rotational transition requires a photon momentum of approximately 3e-31 Ns and none of the options match, but the vibrational transition gives 8.8e-28, which isn't matching, but when considering E= h w/(2 pi), we get 1.4e-27, which is near option B (2.3e-27) or option C (1.1e-27).

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the rotational energy and the options are miscalculated.

But given the options, I think the closest would be option B:2.3e-27 Ns or option C:1.1e-27.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition, but the calculation is incorrect. Let me compute E_rot again.

Wait, E_rot for J=1 is h²/(4 pi² I).

h²=4.39e-67.

I=1.206e-46.

So E_rot=4.39e-67 / (4 * pi² *1.206e-46 ) =4.39e-67/(4 *9.8696 *1.206e-46).

4*9.8696=39.4784.

39.4784 *1.206e-46=47.6e-46.

So E_rot=4.39e-67 /47.6e-46 = (4.39/47.6) *1e-21 =0.0922 *1e-21=9.22e-23 J.

p=9.22e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 Ns.

But no options match.

Given the time I've spent and not finding a matching option, perhaps the intended answer is the vibrational transition, which gives around 8.8e-28 Ns. But none of the options are close. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:1.9e-28 Ns, which is approximately half of 3.8e-28, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed to make an educated guess that the photon's momentum is approximately 1.4e-27 Ns, which is option B.

Wait, no, I calculated 1.4e-27 Ns when considering E= h w/(2 pi), which would be option B is 2.3e-27, but perhaps the correct approach is different.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the task is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:

1. **Energy Transitions**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies:
     \[
     E = E_{\text{rot}} + E_{\text{vib}}
     \]
   - The fundamental state corresponds to \( v = 0 \) (lowest vibrational state) and \( J = 0 \) (lowest rotational state). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) or a rotational transition (\( J = 0 \to J = 1 \)).

2. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are quantized as:
     \[
     E_{\text{vib}} = \left( n + \frac{1}{2} \right) h \omega
     \]
   - The energy difference for the transition \( v = 0 \to v = 1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
     \]
   - Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = E / c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
     \]

3. **Rotational Transition**:
   - The rotational energy levels are quantized as:
     \[
     E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{J (J+1) h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}
     \]
     where \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia, and \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} \) is the reduced mass.
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{(20 \, \text{amu}) (2 \, \text{amu})}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} = 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} = 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The moment of inertia \( I \) is:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
   - The energy difference for the transition \( J = 0 \to J = 1 \) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{4 \pi^2 I}
     \]
     Substituting \( h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \text{J}^2 \cdot \text{s}^2 \) and \( I = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \):
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{4 \pi^2 (1.206 \times 10^{-46})} = \frac{4.39 \times 10^{-67}}{47.6 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
     \]

4. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), corresponding to \( p = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \).
   - The rotational transition requires \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), corresponding to \( p = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \).
   - The rotational transition requires significantly less energy, making it the next state with the lowest possible energy.

5. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated rotational momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)) does not match any of the provided options.
   - The vibrational momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) is also not listed, but it is closer to option **A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) than to the other options.

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated values and the provided options, and considering the vibrational transition as a plausible alternative, the closest option is **A**.

Answer: A
