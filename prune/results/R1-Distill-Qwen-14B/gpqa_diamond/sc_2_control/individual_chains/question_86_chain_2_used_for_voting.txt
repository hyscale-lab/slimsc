Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R) and (S) forms of 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The question is about selecting the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Wait, the products are enantiomers? Because one is R and the other S. Oh, but wait, the first reaction gives (R), and the second gives (S). So each starting material A and B must have led to different configurations.

The reagents used are LiBH4 and BH3. I remember that borohydride reducing agents can affect the stereochemistry of the product, especially in ketones, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. But I think in some cases, like when reducing cyclic ketones, the stereochemistry might depend on the structure of the starting material. Wait, but I'm more confident about the concept of ketone reductions and their stereochemistry.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait! The products are tetrahydropyran derivatives. So perhaps these are cyclic ketones being reduced. Wait, noâ€”tetrahydropyran-2-one is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a cyclic ketone, right? So the starting materials are probably cyclic ketones or something else.

Wait, but looking at the starting materials in the options: All the options are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So that's a pentanoic acid with substituents. Let's see, the structure would be a five-carbon chain. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has an ethyl group, and position 5 has an isobutoxy and an oxo (keto) group.

So the structure would be something like: CH2-CH2-C(ethyl)-C(O-R)-COOH. Wait, wait, wait. Let me draw it. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the chain is 5 carbons, with the carboxylic acid at one end.

So positions are 1 to 5. Position 3 has an ethyl group, position 5 has both isobutoxy and oxo groups. So position 5 has a keto group and an O-isobutyl group.

Wait, but wait, position 5 can't have both a keto and another substituent because the numbering would have to be different. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alpha-keto acid, where the acid is at position 5, with an ethyl at position 3 and an isobutoxy at position 5? I'm a bit confused about the structure, but perhaps I should think about the reaction leading to the product.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring (pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen), with the ketone at position 2. The 4-ethyl is at position 4.

So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ketone? Wait, 2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone, I think. So the ring has a ketone at position 2, and the substituents are at position 4 (ethyl).

How do we get from the starting material (the pentanoic acid) to this product via reduction?

Wait, the starting material is an alpha-keto acid. Because it's 5-oxo-pentanoic acid. So the structure would be something like:

O
||
C-O-isobutyl
|
COOH (or perhaps it's at the other end)

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps I can think about the reduction process.

When you reduce a cyclic ketone, like a cyclic ester or something else, you get an alcohol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, so maybe the starting material is a diketone or another structure that, upon reduction, forms a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether or something else that upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The products are (R) and (S) configurations of the same compound. So the starting materials must have different configurations that lead to different stereoisomer products.

The reagents are LiBH4 and BH3. Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes, but it's also used for esters under certain conditions. BH3 is a milder reducing agent, perhaps used for esters or other carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in the first reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and H+. The product is (R)-4-ethyl... The second reaction uses B with BH3 and H+, giving (S)-4-ethyl...

So the reaction is a ketone reduction. Because LiBH4 and BH3 are used for that.

Wait, but the starting materials are alpha-keto acids. So maybe the reaction involves the reduction of the keto group.

Wait, but wait, if the starting material is an alpha-keto acid, like something with a structure R-CO-COOR', then reducing it would give R-CH2-COOR', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the alpha-keto acid is part of a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Wait, let's think. The product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a dihydroxyketone, and upon reduction, forms something else. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group.

Wait, no, the starting materials are pentanoic acids with substituents. Let me try to draw the structure.

The starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the chain is five carbons, with the acid group at position 5? Or is the acid at position 1? Let me count:

Pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So positions 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3) or something? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, for pentanoic acid, the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH? No, wait. Correctly, it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the first carbon is the COOH, then four more, so positions 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3).

Wait, but in the starting material, it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So position 3 has an ethyl group, position 5 has isobutoxy and oxo groups. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-isobutyl)-CO? No, wait, that can't be right.

Wait, pentanoic acid is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's hexanoic acid. No, I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-R)-O-R? No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product. The product is a cyclic ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has six members: five carbons and one oxygen. The ketone is at position 2, and the ethyl is at position 4.

When you reduce a cyclic ketone, you get a secondary alcohol. But wait, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group, and the reduction breaks the ester.

Wait, no, because LiBH4 is a reducing agent for esters, but under what conditions? I think LiBH4 reduces esters to alcohols, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. When you reduce an alpha-keto ester with a hydride agent, you might get a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction isn't of the keto group but of an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that upon reduction gives the product.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the stereochemistry part. The product has either R or S configuration, so the starting material must have a stereogenic center that controls the configuration.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The cyclic structure would have substituents at positions 2 and 4. The stereochemistry is at the 4-position because the ethyl is there, and the ketone is at 2.

So the configuration (R or S) depends on how the substituents are arranged around the chiral center.

Now, the starting material, being a pentanoic acid with substituents, would have a certain configuration that leads to the product's configuration upon reduction.

But wait, the starting material is an alpha-keto acid, which upon reduction would form a diol or a secondary alcohol. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto acid, which when reduced would form a secondary alcohol. If the starting material has a certain configuration, the hydride reduction would lead to the product with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the exact reaction pathway. Let me try to outline the possible steps.

The reaction is treating A with LiBH4 and H+ to get the R product, and treating B with BH3 and H+ to get the S product.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce esters, ketones, etc. BH3 is perhaps used for less hindered ketones or for different selectivity.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal, and the reduction step is opening it up to form the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enol ether, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then forms the cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the reduction.

When you reduce a ketone with a hydride agent like LiBH4, you typically get an alcohol with the hydride adding to the carbonyl carbon. The configuration of the resulting alcohol depends on the structure of the starting ketone.

Wait, but in cyclic ketones, if the ketone is part of a ring, the reduction would form a secondary alcohol, and the configuration would depend on the ring structure and the approach of the hydride.

But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone.

Wait, no, because the product is a ketone, which is more reduced than an ester. So perhaps the starting material is an ester which upon reduction forms the ketone.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The options for A and B are all the same compound but with different configurations. So, for the two reactions, when treated with different reducing agents, they produce enantiomers.

So the question is about whether the starting material's configuration affects the product's configuration based on the reducing agent used.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center that is retained in the product, but the configuration depends on the reducing agent's approach.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is either R or S. So the starting material must have a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to the product's configuration.

Wait, let's think about the starting material. The options are all (R) or (S) of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

The 5 position has a keto group (oxo) and an isobutoxy group.

So the structure is: COOH-CH2-C(ethyl)-C(O-isobutyl)-something.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-C(O-O-C(CH2)2CH3)-something.

Wait, no, maybe it's:

At carbon 5, there's an oxo group (O) and an isobutoxy group attached. So, perhaps it's:

CH2-CH2-C(ethyl)-C(O-R)-COOH.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the starting material is an alpha-keto acid with a substituent. So, when it's reduced, the keto group is converted into an alcohol.

Wait, but LiBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So if the starting material has a ketone group, reducing it would give an alcohol.

Wait, but in the product, the ketone is still present. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, which upon reduction becomes a ketone.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a Claisen or aldol condensation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting too deep into this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and the reduction breaks it into a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone via some dehydration step. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction of an ester. For example, if the starting material is an ester (like a lactone), when reduced with LiBH4, it would form a diol, but that's not matching the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone substituent. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the ketone remains.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal with a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic enol ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that cyclizes into the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic aminal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the reduction. The configuration of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the hydride.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically provides the hydride from the less hindered side. So if the starting material has a certain configuration, the hydride will attack from a specific face, leading to the R or S configuration in the product.

But in this problem, the two reactions result in products with opposite configurations. So perhaps the starting materials A and B have opposite configurations, and the same or different reducing agents cause the same or opposite configurations in the products.

Wait, in the first reaction, A is treated with LiBH4 and gives R. B is treated with BH3 and gives S. So the same starting material configuration with different reagents gives opposite products? Or different starting materials with different reagents give opposite products.

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and B have the same starting material for A and B, just with different configurations. So perhaps the two starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the products to have opposite configurations.

Wait, but the product is the same compound but R and S. So if the starting materials are enantiomers, the products would also be enantiomers.

Wait, but in the problem, A is being treated with LiBH4 and B with BH3, leading to R and S respectively. So perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent determine the product's configuration.

I think I'm getting somewhere. Let's say that when a chiral starting material is reduced with a hydride agent, the approach of the hydride depends on the structure and the reducing agent's strength.

LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and more capable of attacking from the less hindered side. BH3 is perhaps less effective, so it might approach from the same face leading to opposite configuration.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion. Or perhaps the opposite.

Wait, another approach: the configuration of the product is determined by the configuration of the starting material and the face from which the hydride attacks.

Let me imagine the starting material as having a chiral center at C3 (since the starting material is 3-ethyl...), but wait, the product's chiral center is at C4, which was the position of the ethyl group in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration affects the product's configuration because the hydride attack's face depends on the starting material's substituents.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a carbonyl group, and the hydride attack leads to the formation of a new chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto acid, and the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol, which then cyclizes into the cyclic ketone.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me consider the options.

Options are:

A) A and B are same (S) configuration.

B) Both (R).

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

The correct answer is D. Because when you reduce (R) starting material with LiBH4, you get (R) product, and (S) starting material with BH3 gives (S) product.

Wait, but why would the same configuration give the same product when using different reagents?

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents affect the configuration. For example, LiBH4 leads to R, BH3 leads to S when the starting material is R.

Wait, perhaps the reagents cause different attack directions. So the same starting material would give opposite products when using different reagents.

Wait, but in the problem, A and B are different starting materials, each treated with different reagents to give R and S.

So perhaps A is R configuration, treated with LiBH4 gives R product. B is S configuration, treated with BH3 gives S product.

So the correct option would be D: A is R, B is S.

Wait, but let me think about the actual reaction.

When a chiral ketone is reduced, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon. Depending on the starting material's configuration, the hydride can approach from the top or bottom face, leading to R or S configuration in the product.

If the starting material is (R), and the hydride adds from a specific face, the product would be (R) or (S).

But I'm not exactly clear on how the configuration transfers.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration determines the approach of the hydride. For example, in a cyclic ketone, the hydride would approach from the less hindered side, which depends on the substituents in the starting material.

But without knowing the exact structures, it's a bit challenging.

But given the options, the correct answer is likely option D: A is (R), B is (S). Because each reagent would produce a different configuration based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but wait. If A is (R) and treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps it leads to the (R) product. B is (S) and treated with BH3, which is a milder reducing agent, leading to (S) product.

Alternatively, perhaps the same configuration would give the same product with either reagent, so A and B must have opposite configurations to give opposite products.

So, if the product configurations are R and S, the starting materials must be enantiomers (R and S) so that the different reagents affect the product's configuration.

But how? Let me think.

If the starting material is (R), and the reaction leads to (R) product, and the other starting material is (S) leading to (S) product, then the correct option is D where A is (R) and B is (S).

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials A and B that lead to the enantiomeric products (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one when treated with different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. The starting materials are given as enantiomeric forms of (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reagents and Reaction Type**:  
   - LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.  
   - BH3 is a milder reducing agent, often used for similar reductions but may exhibit stereoselectivity depending on the substrate.  
   - The products are enantiomers, indicating that the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reducing agents play a role in determining the configuration of the products.

2. **Starting Material Structure**:  
   - The starting materials are enantiomeric forms of (3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid). This is an alpha-keto acid with a chiral center at position 3 (due to the ethyl group) and a ketone group at position 5.  

3. **Stereochemical Outcome**:  
   - The configuration of the product (R or S) depends on the configuration of the starting material and the stereochemical course of the reduction.  
   - If the starting material is (R), the reduction with LiBH4 produces the (R)-enantiomer of the product. Similarly, if the starting material is (S), the reduction with BH3 produces the (S)-enantiomer of the product.

4. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would result in both products being (S), which contradicts the given enantiomeric products.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This would result in both products being (R), which also contradicts the given enantiomeric products.  
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured and B is (R)-configured. This would lead to the products having opposite configurations, but the assignments of the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) to A and B are inconsistent with the expected stereochemical outcomes.  
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured and B is (S)-configured. This ensures that the reduction of (R)-configured A with LiBH4 produces the (R)-product, and the reduction of (S)-configured B with BH3 produces the (S)-product. This matches the given enantiomeric products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B. This configuration ensures that the reductions with LiBH4 and BH3 produce the enantiomeric products (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively.

**Answer: D**
