Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. Half of it (a hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing brightness variations that look like an exoplanet transit. But the question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness dip as these spots?

Hmm, I remember that the transit method for exoplanets works by measuring the dip in brightness as the planet passes in front of the star. The bigger the planet relative to the star, the larger the dip. So the formula for the depth of the transit is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, but in this case, it's not a planet causing the dip but star spots. So how does that work? The spots are cooler, so when they're visible, the overall brightness of the star as observed decreases. But star spots aren't blocking light; they're emitting less. So the observed brightness variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view.

Wait a second, the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the photometric variations would look similar. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into view or go away, causing a dip similar to a transit.

But the question is to find the radius of a hypothetical planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots. So we need to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and then equate that to the transit dip from a planet, then solve for the planet's radius.

First, let's figure out the change in brightness due to the spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The flux from the star without spots is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But the spots emit less flux.

The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, what's the filling factor? Oh, it's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each spot covers a certain area, and the sum of all spot areas is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the star is a sphere, so a hemisphere is (2πR²) in area. The total area covered by spots on the hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot's flux is lower because their temperature is lower. The flux from a spot is σT_spot^4. So the total flux from the spots is the number of spots times their area times their flux. Alternatively, the total flux from spots would be (filling factor) * area of hemisphere * σT_spot^4. The rest of the hemisphere is at Teff, so their flux is σTeff^4.

Wait, but the star's normal flux is calculated over its entire surface. The spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, causing the dip.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the relative change in flux when the spots are on the visible hemisphere.

But wait, the star's total flux when not spotted is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. When the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the flux is the sum of the unspotted part of that hemisphere plus the spotted part.

Wait, the star is a sphere, but the hemisphere with spots is the one we see when the star is in a certain orientation. Initially, when the star isn't rotating, perhaps we're seeing the unspotted hemisphere, but when it rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view.

Wait, no. The star is rotating, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So as it rotates, the spotted side comes into view, causing a dip.

Wait, perhaps the way to model it is that the star's brightness is dominated by its normal flux, but when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux drops by a certain amount.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to compute the change in flux when the spotted hemisphere is in view. Normally, when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is at maximum. When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower.

Wait, but the star's total flux when the spotted hemisphere is face-on would be the sum of the flux from the spotted part and the other hemisphere, which is unspotted.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere. If the star is rotating, we see one hemisphere at a time. So when the star isn't rotating, perhaps it's emitting from all sides, but when it's rotating, we see one side.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres: one is spotted, the other is not. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us, the observed flux will be the combination of the flux from the spotted hemisphere and the far side. Wait, no, because the far side is not what we're looking at. Actually, at any given time, we're seeing exactly one hemisphere of the star. So when the star is rotating, the side facing us changes.

Ah, right. So when the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us, that's when the spots are in our field of view. So the total flux we receive is the sum of all the flux from the hemisphere (both spotted and unspotted areas).

Wait, no. The star's surface is a sphere, with a radius R. When the star is at a certain rotation state, we see exactly half of it (the hemisphere facing us). The other hemisphere is on the far side, which we don't see.

So, when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted areas on that hemisphere plus the flux from the unspotted parts of that hemisphere.

Wait, but the problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. So the other hemisphere is spot-free. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are not in view.

Wait, no, the star's entire surface is either part of the spotted hemisphere or the unspotted. So each hemisphere has a certain coverage of spots.

Wait, perhaps the filling factor is only for the spotted hemisphere. So the spotted hemisphere has 20% of its area covered by spots.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is the sum of the flux from the spotted areas (at 5000 K) and the rest of the hemisphere (at 6000 K). When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is entirely from the unspotted hemisphere, which is at 6000 K.

So we can compute the flux in both scenarios and find the difference, which would be the amplitude of the brightness variation.

Let me formalize this.

The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4.

The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted_hemisphere = (unspotted area fraction) * σTeff^4 + (spotted area fraction) * σT_spot^4.

Given that the spotted hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, which is the area covered by spots. So the spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR^2), and the unspotted area is 0.8 * (2πR^2).

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area of spots on the hemisphere is 0.2 * (2πR^2) = 0.4πR².

The rest of the hemisphere's area is 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6πR².

So the flux from the spotted hemisphere when it's facing us is:

F_spotted = (1.6πR²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4πR²) * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us is:

F_unspotted = (2πR²) * σ (6000)^4.

Because the unspotted hemisphere is entirely at 6000 K.

Wait, no, wait. The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted because the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire visible area is at Teff.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is F_spotted - F_unspotted, but wait, actually, no: when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted, and when the other is visible, it's F_unspotted. So the maximum flux is F_unspotted, and the minimum is F_spotted.

So the amplitude (the depth of the dip) is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, because the observed flux goes down when the spots are visible, so the dip is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) compared to F_unspotted.

So let's compute this.

First, calculate F_unspotted:

F_unspotted = 2πR² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = [1.6π R² * σ (6000)^4 ] + [0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4 ].

So the difference is:

ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted = (2πR² σ 6000^4) - [1.6π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.4π R² σ 5000^4 ]

= [2 - 1.6 - 0.4 * (5000/6000)^4 ] * π R² σ 6000^4.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that more carefully.

F_unspotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = (1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4) + (0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4).

So ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted = [2 π R² σ (6000^4)] - [1.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4)].

Simplify:

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

So the fractional change is ΔF / F_unspotted.

F_unspotted is 2 π R² σ 6000^4.

So,

(ΔF)/(F_unspotted) = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4)] / [2 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

The π R² σ terms cancel, so:

= (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (2 * 6000^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (0.4 ( (6^4 -5^4) * 10^12 )) / (2 * 6^4 * 10^12 )

Wait, let me compute 6000^4 and 5000^4. 6000 is 6e3, so 6000^4 = (6)^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

Similarly, 5000^4 is 625e12, which is 6.25e14.

Wait, let me compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6 * 10^3)^4 = 6^4 * 10^12 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5 * 1e3)^4 = 5^4 * 1e12 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 - 5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So,

Numerator: 0.4 * 6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Denominator: 2 * 1.296e15 = 2.592e15.

So,

(ΔF)/(F_unspotted) = (2.684e14) / (2.592e15) ) ≈ 0.1035 or 10.35%.

So the amplitude is about 10.35% dip.

But wait, the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when a planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So the dip amplitude would be (Rp/Rstar)^2, which should equal 0.1035.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure.

In the case of the planet transit, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 because the planet blocks that fraction of the star's light. So if the dip is 10%, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

Wait, sqrt(0.1035) is approx 0.3217, which is about 0.32. Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

Wait, but let me double-check all calculations, because sometimes I might have mixed up steps.

Let me recompute the fractional change.

F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = 1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted = (2 -1.6) π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 - 6000^4) ? Wait, no, no, because F_spotted has a lower flux from spots, so ΔF is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express:

F_unspotted = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4. Because the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K.

F_spotted = (0.8 * 2 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2 π R²) σ (5000)^4.

Wait, no, no. The hemisphere has a filling factor of 0.2, so 20% of the hemisphere's area is spots. The area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So spots cover 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest is 1.6 π R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

F_spotted = (1.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) σ (5000)^4.

F_unspotted is when the other hemisphere is visible, which is 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So ΔF = F_unspotted - F_spotted = [2 π R² σ 6000^4] - [1.6 π R² σ 6000^4 + 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4].

= (2 - 1.6) π R² σ 6000^4 - 0.4 π R² σ 5000^4.

= 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) - 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4).

Factor 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4].

Then, the fractional dip is (ΔF)/(F_unspotted) = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [2 π R² σ 6000^4 ].

Simplify: (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (2 * 6000^4 ) .

Compute 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

Multiply 0.4 * 6.71e14 = 2.684e14.

Divide by 2 * 1.296e15 (which is 2.592e15): 2.684e14 / 2.592e15 ≈ 0.1035, which is 10.35% dip.

So the dip is about 10.35%, which would be the same as a planet blocking (Rp/Rstar)^2 of the light. So solving for Rp/Rstar, we get sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is approximately 0.32.

Looking back at options, option D is ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with spots, we analyze the photometric dip caused by the spots and equate it to the transit depth caused by a planet.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - The star has a radius equal to the Sun's radius (\(R_{\text{star}}\)).
   - The effective temperature of the star is \(T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%, and the spots are cooler with \(T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K}\).

2. **Flux Calculations**:
   - The flux from a blackbody is given by \(F = \sigma T^4\), where \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (0.8 \cdot 2\pi R^2) \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 + (0.2 \cdot 2\pi R^2) \cdot \sigma (5000)^4
     \]
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4
     \]

3. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the fractional change in flux:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
     \]
   - Substituting the flux expressions:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{2\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4 - \left[(1.6\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma (5000)^4)\right]}{2\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4}
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{0.4\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma \left[(6000)^4 - (5000)^4\right]}{2\pi R^2 \cdot \sigma (6000)^4}
     \]
   - Canceling terms:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{0.4 \cdot \left[(6000)^4 - (5000)^4\right]}{2 \cdot (6000)^4}
     \]

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Compute \(6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15}\) and \(5000^4 = 6.25 \times 10^{14}\).
   - Difference: \(6000^4 - 5000^4 = 6.71 \times 10^{14}\).
   - Substituting:
     \[
     \Delta F = \frac{0.4 \cdot 6.71 \times 10^{14}}{2 \cdot 1.296 \times 10^{15}} = \frac{2.684 \times 10^{14}}{2.592 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.1035
     \]
   - The fractional brightness variation is approximately \(10.35\%\).

5. **Exoplanet Transit Depth**:
   - The transit depth caused by a planet is given by \((R_p / R_{\text{star}})^2\).
   - Equating the transit depth to the brightness variation:
     \[
     (R_p / R_{\text{star}})^2 = 0.1035
     \]
   - Solving for \(R_p / R_{\text{star}}\):
     \[
     R_p / R_{\text{star}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3217
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \(0.32\).

### Final Answer:
The radius of the exoplanet relative to the host star is closest to **0.32**.
