Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Hmm, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds to metal ions like calcium. The complex formed here is Ca-EDTA, and I think in this case, it's a 1:1 complex because Ca typically has a +2 charge and EDTA has a -4 charge. So each Ca²+ would bind with one EDTA^4-.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. That probably means that the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio because for each Ca²+ molecule, there's one EDTA molecule. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. 

But wait, when they form a complex, the free calcium ions would be very low because the formation constant K is very large (5e10). A large K means the complex is very stable, so most of the Ca²+ is bound to EDTA, leaving a very small concentration of free Ca²+.

I think the formula for the formation constant K involves the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the individual ions. Oh right, the formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-])

Since the solution is stoichiometric, [Ca²+] should equal [EDTA^4-], because each Ca²+ binds one EDTA^4-.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The initial concentrations before complexation: if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be zero, right? No, wait, no. Because the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA. If the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, then the total concentration of Ca-EDTA is 0.02 M. 

But in the complex, the Ca is in the form of Ca-EDTA, so the total concentration is [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. The rest of the solution has Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in very small concentrations.

But wait, the stoichiometric solution implies that the amount of Ca and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio. So, the total concentration of Ca (free plus complex) is 0.02 M, and same for EDTA. Because each complex molecule has one Ca and one EDTA.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. When you have a solution where the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that's the total concentration of the complex. So the total calcium would be 0.02 M (because each complex has one Ca), and the same goes for EDTA. But in reality, some of that calcium is free and some is bound in the complex.

Wait, but if the solution is stoichiometric, that might mean that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal. Because for every Ca²+ that complexes with EDTA, you consume one EDTA. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are the same, but once the complex forms, the free concentrations are determined by the Kf.

Let me set variables. Let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Then, since EDTA is in excess? Wait, no. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, but I'm not sure about the free concentrations. Let me think.

The formation of the complex is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²- (assuming the charge of the complex is -2, since Ca²+ + EDTA^4- gives overall charge 2-).

The initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both 0 (since the complex is formed from them). Wait, no, that's not right. The initial concentrations would be such that when the complex forms, the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA²-.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this using the expression for Kf. 

Let me denote:

Kf = [CaEDTA²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

We know that [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But what are [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-]?

In a stoichiometric solution, the moles of Ca and EDTA are equal. So the total concentration of Ca²+ is [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

But wait, that's not necessarily correct because the CaEDTA²- is the complex. So the total Ca is [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

Similarly, the total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

But wait, that can't be right because the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-; the total concentration of Ca is 0.02 M, same as the total EDTA. So [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 and similarly for EDTA.

But since the complex is 0.02 M, [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02. So [Ca²+] is 0.02 - [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 - 0.02 = 0? No, that can't be right. Because if all Ca is in the complex, then [Ca²+] is zero, which can't be, because Kf would be infinite then. Hmm.

Wait, no. The initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be such that when they react to form the complex, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are x each, because in the stoichiometric solution, the amount of EDTA and Ca are the same, so the free concentrations would be equal.

Wait, let me think again. Let the concentration of free Ca²+ be x. Then, the concentration of free EDTA^4- would also be x because the initial concentrations are equal, and the reaction is 1:1. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x.

Then, using the Kf expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA²-] / (x^2) 

So 5e10 = 0.02 / (x^2 )

Wait, no. Wait, the [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. So 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10)  
x² = 2e-3 / 5e10  
x² = 4e-13  
x = sqrt(4e-13)  
x = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Or wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. So square root is 2 * 1e-6.5, which is 2e-6.5 M. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is approximately 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So [Ca²+] is 6.32e-7 M, which is 6.3x10^-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is 5x10^10. So the equation Kf = [CaEDTA] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

Since it's stoichiometric, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-] = x. So Kf = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

So x² = 0.02 / 5e10 = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14. Wait, wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13. So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈ 6.32e-7, which matches option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

### Key Information:
- The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M.
- The formation constant is \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \).
- In a stoichiometric solution, the free concentrations of \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\) and \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\) are equal, denoted as \( x \).

### Step 1: Substitute into the formation constant equation
\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{Ca-EDTA}]}{x^2}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( x^2 \)
\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12}
\]
\[
x^2 = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}
\]
\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}}
\]
\[
x = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]
\[
x \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

### Final Answer:
The concentration of calcium ions in the solution is **6.3 × 10⁻⁷ M**, which corresponds to option C.
