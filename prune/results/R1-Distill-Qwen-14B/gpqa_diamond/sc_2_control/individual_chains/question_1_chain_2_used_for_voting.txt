Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with given lifetimes. 

Hmm, I remember that when a quantum state has a certain energy and a lifetime, it's related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! Which says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the equation is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem mentions the lifetime of each state. I think the lifetime relates to the time uncertainty. Oh right, the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time Δt. So Δt is about τ, but wait, the lifetimes given are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds for E1 and E2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the question says the energies are E1 and E2, but I'm trying to find the energy difference ΔE between them.

The problem says we want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels, which probably means we need the energy difference to be such that the uncertainty doesn't make them look like a single state. So the condition for distinguishability is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy, right? Or more accurately, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy so that the two states don't overlap in their energy measurements.

But wait, the uncertainty in energy comes from the lifetime. So each state has its own lifetime, but I'm thinking about the energy difference between them. Hmm, maybe I should model this for each state. Let me think. For each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is given by ΔE ≈ ħ / (2τ), where τ is the lifetime of that state. So for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 sec, and for E2, τ2 is 1e-8 sec.

Wait, no. Because both states have their own lifetimes, but the problem is about the energy difference between them. So the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1, I think. We need ΔE to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state? Or perhaps the uncertainty of the system when measuring the energy. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the natural linewidth, which is related to the lifetime. The natural linewidth is the uncertainty in energy due to the finite lifetime of the state. The formula for the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, I believe. So the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time, and Γ is the uncertainty in energy. So for a state with lifetime τ, the uncertainty in energy Γ is approximately ħ/τ.

Wait, so for E1, Γ1 = ħ/(1e-9) and for E2, Γ2 = ħ/(1e-8). So the natural linewidth for E1 is larger than that for E2 since its lifetime is shorter. But the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So to resolve them, the energy difference should be greater than the sum or something of their uncertainties.

Wait, but perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the maximum uncertainty between them. Alternatively, the minimal energy difference that can be distinguished is when ΔE is greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties, but I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think again. To distinguish two states, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the two states' energies would overlap. So the minimum ΔE required is such that ΔE ≥ ħ/(2 τ_min), where τ_min is the smaller lifetime, since that would be the larger uncertainty. Wait, no, because τ_min is 1e-9, so Γ1 is larger than Γ2. So the uncertainty in E1 is larger, so the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than Γ1, I think.

Wait, but no. Because each state's uncertainty is Γ1 and Γ2. So perhaps the combined uncertainty is the sum of the two? Or maybe the maximum of the two. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's approach it differently. Let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. For E1, τ = 1e-9 s. So Γ1 = ħ / τ. Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / (1e-8 s). Since ħ is about 6.626e-34 J·s divided by 2π, so approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

Wait no, actually, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Γ1 = (1.0545718e-34) / (1e-9) ≈ 1.05457e-25 J. To convert this into eV, since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so Γ1 ≈ 1.05457e-25 / 1.602e-19 ≈ approx 6.58e-7 eV. Similarly, Γ2 = ħ/(1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. In eV, that's 1.05e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-calculate Γ1 and Γ2.

Γ1 = ħ / τ1 = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.05e-25 J.

Convert that to eV: 1 J = 6.242e18 eV, so 1.05e-25 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 6.55e-7 eV.

Similarly, Γ2 = ħ / (1e-8 s) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 J * 6.242e18 eV/J ≈ 6.55e-8 eV.

So Γ1 is about 6.55e-7 eV, and Γ2 is 6.55e-8 eV.

Now, the question is about the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1. To clearly distinguish them, ΔE must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Or is it just the larger uncertainty?

Wait, if the energy difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty, then you can distinguish them. Because if ΔE is larger than each individual uncertainty, then the two states' energies don't overlap. Alternatively, if the energy difference is larger than the sum, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Wait, think about it. Suppose E1 has a width Γ1 and E2 has a width Γ2. The two energy levels are E1 and E2. If the separation ΔE is greater than the sum of Γ1 and Γ2, then their spectral lines don't overlap. So to clearly distinguish, ΔE should be greater than (Γ1 + Γ2).

Wait, let's compute that. Γ1 ≈ 6.55e-7 eV, Γ2 is 6.55e-8 eV. Their sum is about 7.2e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference to be distinguishable, it needs to be larger than this sum. So looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV. That's 0.001 e-7 eV. Way smaller than 7e-7. So not sufficient.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller, so no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's 0.0001 eV. Which is larger than 7e-7. So 1e-4 is much larger than 7e-7. So this would work.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. That's 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8. 7e-7 is 0.7e-6, which is much larger than 1e-8. So 1e-8 is smaller than 7e-7, so D wouldn't work.

So the correct option is C, 1e-4 eV, as it's larger than the sum of the uncertainties. But wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, they might just consider the uncertainty as Γ ≈ ħ/τ, and the energy difference needs to be larger than Γ for each state. But in that case, since Γ1 is larger (6.55e-7 eV), ΔE must be larger than that. So any ΔE larger than 6.55e-7 would suffice.

Looking back, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.55e-7. So it's sufficient. The other options are smaller than 6.55e-7, except for option C.

Wait, but the options don't have 1e-6 eV. Let me list the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 meV, too small.

B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV, which is 100 meV, a lot bigger than the required.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, smaller than the required.

So the only option that meets the condition is C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the calculations. Because ħ is approx 1.05e-34 J·s, and τ is 1e-9 s for E1.

So Γ1 = ħ / τ = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.05e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 6.55e-7 eV.

Yes, that's correct. So Γ1 is 6.55e-7 eV, and Γ2 is 6.55e-8 eV.

So the sum is about 7.2e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be larger than 7.2e-7 eV to have clear distinction.

Looking at the options:

- C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4 eV. That's 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8, which is way bigger than 7e-7.

So option C is the correct choice.

To distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), their energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties in energy, which are determined by their lifetimes \( \tau_1 \) and \( \tau_2 \) via the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The uncertainty in energy for each state is given by:

\[
\Gamma = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties for each state
- For \( E_1 \) with \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Gamma_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Gamma_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For \( E_2 \) with \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Gamma_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Gamma_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the minimum energy difference for distinguishability
To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E > \Gamma_1 + \Gamma_2
\]
\[
\Delta E > 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.001 \, \text{meV} \), which is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for clearly distinguishing the two energy levels is **C**.
