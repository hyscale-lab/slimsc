Okay, so I've got this pretty complicated question here about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and mice models.

Alright, the scenario is that someone created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two genes, right? In this case, the ligand and the receptor. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry site, so it can drive the translation of the downstream gene without the need for another promoter. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor expression is IRES-driven, perhaps in the same transcript but translated separately.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. LoxP is a site recognized by Cre recombinase. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor and eGFP are separated by a lox2272 cassette. I think lox2272 is a variant that Cre can also recognize, but maybe it's a different arrangement. Wait, Cre recombinase can act on loxP sites, but maybe lox2272 is a mutated version where Cre can only cut if paired with another lox2272 site. Or perhaps it's a different system used for different recombinases, like Flp. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Oh wait, sometimes lox2272 is used in a system where Cre can mediate recombination only when paired with another lox2272, or maybe it's used for conditional expression. Not entirely sure right now, but perhaps that's not the main issue here.

So the setup is that when Cre is expressed, it should excise those stop cassettes. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed together, and the receptor and eGFP would also be expressed together.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a wild-type background. They crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the control of SOX10, meaning it's expressed in neural crest-derived cells. The idea is that Cre would recombine the lox sites, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

After the offspring are born, they visualize them under a confocal microscope. They're looking for green signal, which should come from eGFP. But they don't see any green. Why?

The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does this explain no eGFP signal? The absence of green would mean the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. If it's paracrine, perhaps the ligand is secreted and acts on other cells, but in the construct, the receptor is under IRES, so maybe it's expressed along with the ligand in the same cells. So I'm not sure how A would affect the expression here. Maybe this isn't the right reason.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficking properly, maybe it's not at the cell surface. But then you wouldn't see eGFP in the cells, but maybe the Western blot would show the protein. Wait, the question says they tested expression on Western blot and the signals were proportional to actin. So the proteins are being expressed. So if the Western blot shows the receptor and eGFP are present (as detected by their antibodies), then the problem isn't with expression or trafficking to the cell surface. Unless the GFP is not functional, but the question says eGFP is fused to the receptor. So if it's stuck in the Golgi, perhaps it's not fluorescent because it's not on the surface. But the Western blot would show the protein is present. But the question doesn't say what the Western blot showed. Wait, the question says "you use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture." So the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So perhaps the construct works there, but not in the transgenic mice. Or maybe in the mice, Cre isn't active, so the stop cassettes aren't excised.

Wait, but they crossed the homozygous mice to SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so Cre should be active there, recombine the lox sites, and allow expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

So if the mouse doesn't show green, maybe the Cre isn't working, or the recombination didn't happen. But the construct is in a homozygous state. Or perhaps there's a problem with the expression cassettes.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor is under IRES. So when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed. But if they're not, perhaps the Cre isn't active in the cells. But in the offspring, they're using SOX10-Cre, which should be active in the right cells.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the ligand and receptor are not expressed because the promoters are not active. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. Maybe the IRES isn't working correctly, so the receptor isn't being expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed because of a frame issue. Looking at option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, that's a possibility. The construct is made so that the receptor is in frame with eGFP, right? Because after the stop cassette is removed, the receptor ORF is in frame with eGFP. If the IRES is upstream, maybe the eGFP is not in frame. Wait, no, the IRES is for the receptor. So the ligand is under CBA, then the IRES, then the receptor-eGFP.

Wait, the vector is ligand ORF (CBA promoter), then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. Then, the receptor has its own ORF, under IRES, and the eGFP is at the C-terminus. So the receptor is in frame with eGFP. If the stop cassettes are correctly removed by Cre, the ligand and mCherry should be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

But what if the IRES doesn't function correctly? Or perhaps the stop cassettes aren't being excised. Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the same arrangement. Then, when they cross to SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in the neural crest cells, which should excise the stop cassettes, allowing ligand and mCherry, and receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But if the stop cassettes are not excised, then the ligand is under a strong promoter but the mCherry is not expressed because the stop is in between. Similarly, the receptor is under IRES, but the stop is between receptor and eGFP, so eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

But then why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the stop cassette wasn't excised.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, so each allele has the same arrangement. When crossed with Cre, each allele would have their lox sites recombined, allowing expression.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. Or perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the ORF is not continuous, leading to no eGFP expression.

Wait, let's think about the vector structure again.

The vector is bicistronic. The first gene is ligand ORF under CBA promoter, followed by a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. Then, the receptor ORF is under IRES, followed by a stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272), then eGFP.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says:

- Ligand ORF at 5' position, fused to mCherry.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry: stop in loxP-stop-loxP.

So the ligand is first, then stop, then mCherry.

Similarly, receptor ORF is at 3' position, fused to eGFP. Between receptor and eGFP: stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272.

So the structure is:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP stop loxP -> mCherry -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272 stop lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, that can't be right because the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the IRES is perhaps part of the receptor's expression cassette.

Wait, no, the description is: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So perhaps the vector is ligand (CBA-driven), followed by a stop and mCherry, then IRES, then receptor, then a stop and eGFP.

Wait, that would make the vector:

[CBA promoter] --> ligand --> stop (loxP) --> mCherry

Then, after mCherry, perhaps an IRES, then receptor, then stop (lox2272) --> eGFP.

No, I think the correct structure is that the ligand is under CBA, then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. The receptor is under IRES, meaning the IRES is at the end of the ligand ORF, so that the receptor ORF is translated via IRES. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has the ligand and receptor each in their own expression cassettes, connected in a way that Cre can excise the stop cassettes to allow expression.

But perhaps the issue is that in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes are removed, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

If the mouse model is homozygous, and they're using SOX10-Cre, which is a neural crest-specific Cre, so Cre is expressed in the neural crest cells. Thus, the ligand and receptor should be expressed in those cells.

But no green signal was observed under the confocal. So eGFP isn't being expressed.

Possible reasons:

1. The Cre isn't active, so the stop cassettes aren't excised. But SOX10-Cre should be active in neural crest.

2. The IRES isn't functional, so the receptor isn't expressed.

3. The eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop is removed, the ORF is not correct.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So if the vector wasn't correctly spliced, or the ORF isn't in frame, then even if the stop is removed, the eGFP may not be expressed.

But how would that happen? The construct was made with the receptor's ORF followed by eGFP in frame. If during cloning, the insertion of eGFP caused a frame shift, then the ORF for the receptor would terminate early, and eGFP might not be expressed. But the question says the ligand and receptor were identified, so they probably have the correct ORFs.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassettes weren't properly excised. For example, if the lox sites aren't correctly recognized by Cre, the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is homozygous. Each allele would have the same structure. So when Cre is expressed, it should excise both stop cassettes on each allele. So if the Cre is active, the stops are gone.

Another angle: the CBA promoter is only active in certain cell types. But it's a strong promoter, so perhaps it's active in most cells. But perhaps the IRES isn't correctly driving the receptor expression.

Wait, but the ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed, but the receptor is under IRES. So the receptor would be expressed only if the IRES is functional and in the correct context.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand's ORF. So the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and then the IRES drives the receptor. So the vector is:

CBA promoter --> ligand ORF --> IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP.

Wait, that would mean that the ligand is expressed, and the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate transcript, or perhaps in the same transcript but as a separate ORF.

Wait, but the stop between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So when Cre is present, it excises this, allowing mCherry to be expressed with the ligand. Similarly, the stop between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272 cassette, which Cre would excise, allowing eGFP to be expressed with the receptor.

So assuming that Cre is functional, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would be expressed.

If the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the problem is with the stop cassette not being excised. So why wouldn't the stop be excised? Maybe the Cre isn't active, or the lox sites are not correctly recognized.

But SOX10-Cre should be active in neural crest cells. Another possibility is that the mice are homozygous for the construct, but perhaps the Cre isn't active because it's not under a proper promoter. No, SOX10-Cre is a transgenic line where Cre is under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest.

Hmm, another thought: maybe the vector uses loxP and lox2272, which are different sites. Cre can recognize loxP sites, but lox2272 might require another recombinase. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but I think Cre can still recognize and recombine it, but perhaps only when paired with another lox2272 site, not with loxP. So if the vector has loxP between ligand and mCherry, and lox2272 between receptor and eGFP, then Cre would only recombine the loxP sites, but not the lox2272 sites. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, because lox2272 is a site designed to be recognized by Cre but only when paired with another lox2272 site. So in the vector, if the ligand has loxP stop loxP, Cre would excise that. But the receptor has lox2272 stop lox2272 – so Cre can't excise that unless there's another lox2272 nearby. Or perhaps the lox2272 is a site that requires a different recombinase, like Flp. No, I think Cre can recombine lox2272, but perhaps only in a certain context.

Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Lox2272 is a site that can be used with Cre, but perhaps it's a lox site that is only cut when in a certain configuration. Alternatively, lox2272 is a site that, when paired with another lox2272, is cut by Cre. I'm not 100% sure, but let's think about that.

In the vector, the ligand has a loxP stop loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272 stop lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is expressed, it can only recombine the loxP sites. The lox2272 sites might not be recombined because Cre doesn't recognize them correctly. Wait, no, I think Cre can recognize any lox site, but the pairing matters.

Wait, no. Cre is a recombinase that recognizes loxP sites. lox2272 is a loxP variant where the recombination is directional. So Cre can still recombine lox2272 sites, but perhaps only in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses a dual recombinase system, but that's not indicated here.

So, in our case, the ligand's stop cassette is flanked by loxP sites, and the receptor's is flanked by lox2272. So when Cre is present, it should only cut the loxP sites, leaving the lox2272 sites untouched. That would mean that the ligand's stop is excised, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed, but the receptor's stop (lox2272) isn't excised. Therefore, the receptor would not be expressed, and eGFP would remain under the stop cassette.

Ah! So that would explain why the eGFP isn't expressed. Because the Cre can only cut the loxP sites, not the lox2272 sites. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not.

Wait, but in the question, after crossing to SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring are supposed to have the Cre expressed in neural crest cells. But because the stop cassettes for the receptor are lox2272, Cre can't cut them. So the receptor and eGFP remain under the stop cassette, so they're not expressed. Therefore, no green signal.

Looking back at the options, which one matches this reasoning?

Option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES. So probably not C.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed regardless of the frame.

But wait, in the construct, the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop wasn't excised because the lox sites aren't compatible with Cre.

In the question, the ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and it's loxP. The receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP, and it's lox2272.

If the Cre in the SOX10-Cre mice can only recognize loxP sites, then when Cre is expressed, it only excises the ligand's stop, not the receptor's. Therefore, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not. So no green signal from eGFP.

But the question is why no eGFP. So the reason is that the stop cassette for the receptor is flanked by lox2272, which Cre cannot recognize, so the stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, none of the options directly state this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean the ligand is secreted, and the receptor is on neighboring cells. But if the ligand and receptor are expressed in the same cells, then why no eGFP? Not sure.

Option B: receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If that were the case, the eGFP would be present (as seen in Western blot), but not on the cell surface. But the question says they're looking for fluorescence, which would be cell surface. But the Western blot shows that the proteins are expressed (proportional to actin), so the issue isn't with expression but rather with eGFP expression.

Wait, the Western blot was done after plasmid transfection to astrocyte culture. So the construct works in astrocytes, as the proteins are expressed. But in the transgenic mice, the expression may differ.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, so the Cre is required to excise the stops. If the stops aren't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another possibility: the eGFP is inserted in the opposite direction. No, the question says it's fused to the C-terminus.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working. The IRES should allow the receptor to be translated after the ligand. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

But the ligand is under a strong promoter, and the receptor is under IRES, so if the IRES isn't working, the receptor wouldn't be expressed, leading to eGFP not being expressed. But the question doesn't mention anything about the IRES not working.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the lox sites are wrong. The vector uses loxP and lox2272, which might not be compatible with Cre. So Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop isn't excised. So eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question's options don't have an option about the lox sites not being compatible.

Wait, the options are:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship.

B) the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi.

C) the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.

D) the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

So, none of the options directly address the lox site issue. But let's think about the design. The ligand is at 5', under CBA, with a stop in loxP, and mCherry. The receptor is at 3', under IRES, with stop in lox2272, and eGFP.

In the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is excised, allowing ligand and mCherry expression. The receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, which Cre can't excise because perhaps the lox2272 is a different site. So the receptor's stop remains, so receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

But the answer options don't have that as an option. So perhaps another angle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the IRES is after the ligand, meaning the receptor is expressed as a separate transcript, but the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the CBA promoter is only for the ligand, and the IRES is for the receptor. So without the IRES working, the receptor isn't expressed. But the question says that when transfected into astrocytes, the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed. So perhaps in the astrocyte culture, the IRES is working, but in the mouse, it's not. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, leading to no expression. So if the eGFP is inserted in a way that causes a frameshift, the receptor's ORF is disrupted, and eGFP isn't expressed. That's option D.

But why would the Western blot show the receptor? If the eGFP is out of frame, the receptor might not be expressed, because the stop codon is in frame. Wait, no. If the eGFP is inserted after the receptor, and the insertion causes a frameshift, the receptor's ORF would terminate earlier, leading to a truncated receptor. But the Western blot would show a smaller band if that's the case. However, the question states that the signals are proportional to actin, implying that the proteins are expressed. So perhaps the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

But the question says that in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed. So if the eGFP is out of frame, the receptor might not be expressed either. But the Western blot in the question was done in astrocytes, which may have expressed the ligand and mCherry, but perhaps the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed because they're not in frame. But the question says when the construct is transfected into astrocytes, the Western blot shows the proteins. So perhaps the issue is not with the frame.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor, but the stop cassette isn't excised. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that if Cre can't excise the stop (because of lox2272), then the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't directly address that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the lox sites are in a way that Cre can't recombine them. For example, the lox sites are in the same orientation, so Cre can't mediate recombination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the construct has both loxP and lox2272 sites, and the Cre can't recognize the lox2272. So the ligand's stop is excised, but the receptor's isn't. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason for no eGFP is that the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre, so the stop isn't excised, eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't have that as an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option D, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic vector, so the two cassettes are co-expressed. But if the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed. So perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the IRES isn't driving translation of the receptor.

But if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed, leading to no eGFP. But the question states that in the Western blot, the proteins are expressed, which suggests that the IRES is functional.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the eGFP is inserted in the wrong orientation. If eGFP is in the opposite direction, its expression would require a promoter, but in the construct, it's just after the receptor. So without a promoter, it wouldn't be expressed. But the question says the ORF is fused to eGFP, so it's in the same direction.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think of the options again.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If they're not in frame, then the receptor is expressed with a stop codon, and eGFP isn't. But in that case, the Western blot would show the receptor as a smaller band. But the question says the signals are proportional to actin, which implies the proteins are present. So maybe the eGFP is not being expressed, but the receptor is. So why no eGFP?

Wait, the vector is designed so that upon Cre expression, the stops are excised. The ligand is under CBA, so it's expressed, and the receptor is under IRES.

If the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't excised, then eGFP isn't expressed.

So why isn't the stop excised? Two possibilities: either the Cre isn't active, or the lox sites aren't recognized.

If the Cre isn't active, then the stop isn't excised. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should express Cre in neural crest. So the problem must be that the Cre can't recognize the lox sites.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's lox sites are in a way that prevents Cre from excising. For example, lox2272 requires a different recombinase, like Flp, but that's not the case here.

Wait, lox2272 is a loxP variant that is recognized by Cre, but requires another lox2272 site to recombine. So if both lox sites are lox2272, then Cre can recombine them. But in our case, the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272, and the ligand's by loxP.

So when Cre is expressed, it will recognize the loxP sites, excising the ligand's stop, but won't touch the lox2272 sites, leaving the receptor's stop in place. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP are not. Therefore, the green signal (eGFP) isn't observed.

So the reason is that the lox sites for the receptor's stop are lox2272, which Cre can't recombine, so the stop isn't excised.

But the options don't include this. So the closest option is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed, regardless of the stop. But the construct in the mouse would require the IRES to express the receptor, but if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor isn't expressed.

But the Western blot in astrocytes showed that the proteins were expressed, which suggests that the IRES is functional.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame, so even if the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that would require that the eGFP is out of frame, leading to no expression. But if the stop wasn't excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed regardless.

Wait, perhaps the vector was designed incorrectly, such that the eGFP is not in the same frame as the receptor. So when the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't in frame and isn't expressed. But that would mean that the stop is excised, but eGFP isn't expressed. But how would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in the same ORF as the receptor, but in the wrong frame, leading to no eGFP expression even if the stop is excised.

But the question's setup doesn't mention any frame issues, so perhaps option D is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: the vector may have a Kozak sequence or other eukaryotic start codon context for the receptor. If the eGFP is added without proper context, it might not be expressed. But the question says the ORF is fused, so that shouldn't be the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is inserted in such a way that it's in the same reading frame as the receptor, but the ORF doesn't include a start codon for eGFP, so it's not translated.

But the question says the ORF is fused to eGFP, implying that the eGFP is in frame and under the receptor's promoter.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the IRES. The IRES is used to drive the receptor's expression. If the IRES is not functional, the receptor isn't expressed, leading to no eGFP.

But in the Western blot, the astrocytes showed expression, so perhaps the IRES is functional.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think which option makes the most sense.

The question states that the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre. But no eGFP is observed.

If the construct had the correct lox sites, then Cre would excise the stops and allow eGFP expression. So why isn't it working?

Possibly, the IRES is not properly positioned, or the eGFP is not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is in the wrong place, causing the eGFP not to be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is inserted in a way that disrupts the receptor's reading frame, leading to no eGFP.

But the correct answer is probably D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame.

Wait, but the vector was correctly designed with both in frame. So if the answer is D, that would mean a mistake in the construct design. But the question doesn't suggest that the construct was incorrectly made.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is with the promoter. The ligand is under CBA, which is strong, but the receptor is under IRES, which might not function in all cell types.

Wait, but SOX10-Cre is expressed in neural crest cells, so the IRES should work there.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES is only functional in certain cell types, and in the cells being examined (maybe astrocytes?), it's not active. But the question says that in the primary astrocyte culture, the proteins are expressed, so the IRES works there.

So perhaps the real issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop isn't excised, and the stop isn't excised because Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites.

But there's no option addressing that, so the next best explanation is D.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, looking at the options again, perhaps option C is incorrect because the enhancer is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which doesn't require an enhancer, and the IRES is a constitutive element.

Wait, perhaps the enhancer is necessary for the IRES to function. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES isn't functional, leading to no eGFP. But the Western blot would show the receptor, but if the stop isn't excised, the receptor might not be expressed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The most likely reason is that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop isn't excised, which is because the lox sites are incompatible with Cre. Since none of the options address this, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but another angle: the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is lox2272, but the Cre used doesn't recognize that site. For example, the Cre might be a mutant that only recognizes loxP. So in that case, the stop isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the answer would be that the lox sites aren't compatible, but that's not an option. In this case, perhaps the correct option is C: the enhancer is missing. But I don't see how that applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't active, leading to no eGFP.

But the correct answer is probably option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think which option is the most plausible given the setup.

The problem is that eGFP isn't expressed. The possible reasons are:

1. The stop isn't excised.

2. The IRES isn't working.

3. The eGFP is not in frame.

4. The construct is in a paracrine relationship, but that doesn't directly explain the expression.

Given the setup, and the fact that the vector uses loxP and lox2272, perhaps the reason is that the stops aren't excised because Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in the correct frame, so even if the stop is excised, it's not expressed.

But given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. But I'm not sure why that would be the case.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES. So enhancer shouldn't be a problem.

Another possibility: the vector isn't correctly designed, and the IRES is placed in a way that it doesn't function, so the receptor isn't expressed.

But again, the Western blot shows the proteins are expressed in astrocytes, so the IRES works there.

Hmm. I'm going to have to make an educated guess here. The most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. So the eGFP isn't expressed because it's out of frame, so no eGFP is observed.

The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor in neural crest cells. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry. The receptor ORF is fused to eGFP, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. After crossing mice homozygous for this construct with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand acts on neighboring cells, but it does not explain why eGFP is not expressed in the transgenic mice. The absence of fluorescence is due to a lack of eGFP expression, not the relationship between ligand and receptor. This option does not address the issue.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would still be synthesized and detected on a Western blot. However, the question specifies that the absence of green signal is observed, which suggests that eGFP is not being expressed at all, rather than being trafficked improperly. This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong, constitutive promoter that does not require an enhancer. The receptor is under an IRES, which is a regulatory element that drives translation without requiring additional enhancers. The absence of an enhancer is not a plausible explanation for the lack of eGFP expression.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in the frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in the same reading frame, the receptor's ORF would terminate early, and eGFP would not be expressed. This could explain the absence of fluorescence. However, the Western blot performed in astrocytes showed that the proteins are expressed, suggesting that the construct is functional in other contexts. This discrepancy makes this option less likely but still plausible.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the correct reading frame, leading to the absence of eGFP expression. This aligns with the observation of no green signal in the confocal microscopy. While the lox2272 sites not being recognized by Cre is a plausible technical issue, it is not explicitly addressed in the options. Therefore, the best answer based on the given options is:

**Answer: D**
