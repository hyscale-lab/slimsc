Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the density matrix of a qubit. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think through it carefully.

The question gives the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. 

Wait, what's a density matrix look like for a pure state versus a mixed state? Oh right, for a pure state |psi><psi|, the density matrix is a projector, and it has trace 1 and rank 1. But when you have a mixed state, the density matrix is a statistical mixture, like a convex combination of projectors. 

In this case, the given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. So each term is a projector, and they are being averaged. That makes rho a mixed state because it's an equal mixture of the two basis states. So this qubit is in a completely mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I think qubit states are represented in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are points on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is rho = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices (X, Y, Z) and r is a vector in 3D space (x, y, z). The vector r gives the position on the Bloch sphere.

So let's compute this. The given rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write |0> as (1, 0) and |1> as (0, 1). So |0><0| is [[1, 0],[0, 0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So rho = (I)/2.

Wait, so rho is I/2. That makes sense because I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So rho = (I + 0·X + 0·Y + 0·Z)/2. Because in this case, the coefficients for X, Y, Z are all zero. So the vector r would be (0, 0, 0). 

Because in the Bloch representation, when the density matrix is (I + 0·X + 0·Y +0·Z)/2, the vector r is (0,0,0). That's the center of the Bloch sphere, right? Because the identity matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the center. So when all the components are zero, the point is at the origin in the Bloch sphere, which is the origin in 3D space.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait a second, let me make sure. Another way to think about it: the density matrix rho is diagonal with entries 1/2 and 1/2. The Bloch vector components can be found from the off-diagonal terms. The general form of rho for a qubit is:

rho = [[ (1 + x)/2 , (y + iz)/2 ],
        [ (y - iz)/2 , (1 - x)/2 ] ]

In our case, rho is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Comparing, (1 + x)/2 = 1/2 → x=0; (1 - x)/2 =1/2 → same. The off-diagonal terms (y + iz)/2 =0, which implies y=0, z=0. So the vector r is (0,0,0), which is option C. Yep, that makes sense.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, specifically a completely mixed state, as it is an equal mixture of the two basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) is the vector of Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r} = (x, y, z)\) is a 3D vector that determines the position of the qubit state in the Bloch sphere. For the given \(\rho\), it simplifies to 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2},
\]

which corresponds to \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This means the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, representing the completely mixed state. Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the state \(|1\rangle\), a pure state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state, not the mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\) corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.
