Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see what I can remember.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass greater than the Sun: 1.5 and 1.2 times respectively. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not too sure about the details, so I'll have to focus on the data given.

Let's write down the given data. For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

And for Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Wait, I remember that the square brackets in these notations mean logarithmic abundances relative to another element. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, is it the other way around? I think it's [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, let me clarify. The notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, subtracted by the same ratio in the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Because the Sun's ratio is the reference. So if [X/Y] is positive, X is more abundant relative to Y than in the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

Okay, so for the Sun, the ratios are:
nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
nMg/nH = 10^(-5)
So nMg/nFe would be (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) )= 1e-0.5 = about 0.316.

But that's the Sun; the stars may have different ratios.

Now, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, (n_Si1 / n_Si2). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the ratio of silicon atoms is probably n_Si,Star1 / n_Si,Star2. Or is it (n_Si in Star1) / (n_Si in Star2)? I think that's what it's asking.

So I need to compute [n_Si1 / n_Si2]. How can I get this from the given data?

Let me think about each star.

Starting with Star_1:

We know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So that means log(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun. Let me compute that. The Sun's nFe is known (1e-4.5) and n_Si can be found using the other data. Wait, wait, the Sun's composition is given for Fe and Mg, but not directly for Si. Hmm. So I need to find the Sun's [Si/Fe], but I don't have it yet.

Wait, but the Sun's composition is given as nFe/nH and nMg/nH. I don't have nSi/nH for the Sun. Oh, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] in terms of these.

Let me think about the Sun's abundance. Let me denote:

nFe_sun = F, nMg_sun = M, nSi_sun = S.

We know from the Sun's data:

log(F / H_sun) = -4.5 → F = H * 1e-4.5
Similarly, log(M / H_sun) = -5 → M = H * 1e-5

But what about S? The problem doesn't give nSi/nH for the Sun. Hmm, maybe I can find [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, [Si/Fe]_sun = log(S_sun / F_sun) = log( (S / H) / (F / H) ) = log(S/F) = log( (nSi/nH) / (nFe/nH) ) = log( nSi/nFe ).

So [Si/Fe]_sun = log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But I don't know nSi/nFe for the Sun. Hmm, this could be a problem. Alternatively, perhaps we can express [Si/Fe] in terms of the other elements.

Wait, but maybe the problem makes it so that we don't need the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Let's see.

Wait, let me think about Star_1 first.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. That means that the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as in the Sun. So log(nFe1 / nH1) = log(nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) → nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

So nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * nH1.

But in the Sun, nFe_sun = F, nH_sun = H.

So nFe1 = (F / H) *nH1.

But I don't know the ratio of nH1 to nH_sun. Wait, wait, in stellar atmospheres, the total hydrogen density (nH) is not necessarily the same as the Sun's. But when using the abundance ratios, [Fe/H] is often the logarithm of (nFe/nH) relative to the Sun.

Wait, [Fe/H] is a logarithmic measure of the abundance of iron compared to hydrogen. So [Fe/H]_1 = log( (nFe1 /nH1) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) ) = 0.

Which means (nFe1/nH1) = (nFe_sun/nH_sun). So nFe1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH1.

But since nFe_sun and nH_sun are known in terms of H (as per the Sun's data), perhaps I can write nFe1 in terms of nH1. But maybe it's easier to work with ratios relative to H.

Wait, perhaps for both stars, we can express their n_Si in terms of their respective H and Fe (or Mg) abundances.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the ratios for each star.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( n_Si1 / n_Fe1 ) - [Si/Fe]_sun = 0.3.

Wait, no. [Si/Fe]_1 is log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - log(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) ) = 0.3.

So log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

We don't know [Si/Fe]_sun, so perhaps this approach isn't helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can express n_Si1 in terms of n_Fe1. Let me denote [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( n_Si1 / n_Fe1 ) = 0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, but without knowing [Si/Fe]_sun, this might not help. Hmm.

Wait a second, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun using the other data.

Wait, if I can express [Si/Fe]_sun in terms of [Mg/Si]_sun and [Mg/Fe]_sun. Oh wait, but I don't have [Mg/Fe]_sun.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute [Si/Fe]_sun using the given Sun's nMg and nFe.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the abundances of Mg, Fe, and Si in the Sun. But without knowing nSi, I'm stuck. So maybe I need to find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the ratio [Mg/Si] in the Sun is known. Because the problem gives [Mg/Si]_2 for Star_2, but not for the Sun.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to not need the Sun's [Mg/Si], because Star_2's [Mg/Si] is given. Let me think.

Wait, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So that's log(n_Mg2/n_Si2) - log(n_Mg_sun / n_Si_sun ) =0.3.

So, log( (n_Mg2 /n_Si2) / (n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun) ) =0.3 → (n_Mg2 /n_Si2 ) = (n_Mg_sun /n_Si_sun) *10^{0.3}.

Wait, but without knowing the Sun's [Mg/Si], which is log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun), I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, wait, the problem gives [Mg/H]_2=0. So log(n_Mg2/n_H2) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_H_sun )=0 → n_Mg2/n_H2 = n_Mg_sun /n_H_sun.

Wait, but n_Mg_sun is known because the Sun's data says 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=-5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So n_Mg2 /n_H2 = 1e-5.

So n_Mg2 = 1e-5 *n_H2.

Similarly, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

n_Fe_sun is 1e-4.5, as we saw earlier. So n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) * (n_H1 /n_H_sun) * n_H_sun?

Wait, no, wait. Because [Fe/H]_1 is log( n_Fe1/n_H1 ) - log( n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ) )=0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

But I don't know n_H1 relative to n_H_sun. Hmm. That seems like a problem because the total hydrogen might vary between the stars.

Wait, but maybe the problem is set in such a way that the ratio n_Si1 /n_Si2 can be found without knowing the absolute H abundances.

Let me try to find n_Si1 in terms of n_Fe1 and the given [Si/Fe]_1. Similarly, find n_Si2 in terms of n_Mg2 and the given [Mg/Si]_2.

Because, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log( n_Si1 /n_Fe1 ) = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3.

But wait, without knowing [Si/Fe]_sun, I'm stuck. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to compute the absolute abundances, I can express the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 in terms of the ratios of other elements in each star.

Let me think:

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{ [Si/Fe]_1 + [Si/Fe]_sun }

Wait, no, because [Si/Fe]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) - [Si/Fe]_sun.

So, n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{ [Si/Fe]_1 + [Si/Fe]_sun }.

But again, without knowing [Si/Fe]_sun, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express [Si/Fe]_sun in terms of the Sun's data.

Wait, the Sun's [Fe/H] is log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ), but that's given as part of the data. Wait, [Fe/H]_sun isn't given, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is [Fe/H]_sun = log(n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun ). But I don't know [Fe/H]_sun. Wait, the problem gives the Sun's 12 + log(n_Fe/nH) =7.5 → So log(n_Fe/nH) = -4.5 → [Fe/H]_sun = -4.5.

Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe/n_H) relative to the Sun. Wait, no. Wait, [Fe/H] is defined as log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ). So if the Sun's log(n_Fe/n_H) is -4.5, then [Fe/H]_sun = log( (n_Fe/n_H)_sun ) - log( (n_Fe/n_H)_sun ) =0. So that can't be. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the definition of [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So for [Fe/H]_sun, it's log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun) - log(n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun )=0.

So [Fe/H]_sun is zero. So when the problem gives [Fe/H]_1=0, it means that Star_1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun, which is already zero. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because then, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning n_Fe1/n_H1 = n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun.

So n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

Similarly, n_Fe_sun = (1e-4.5) *n_H_sun.

Wait, because for the Sun, n_Fe/n_H =1e-4.5 → n_Fe =1e-4.5 *n_H.

So n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) * (n_H1 /n_H_sun).

Hmm, but without knowing n_H1, perhaps I can find the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 without absolute numbers.

Wait, let me try to find n_Si1 in terms of n_Fe1.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = [Si/Fe]_sun +0.3.

But I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Sun's [Si/Fe] can be determined using the given data. Because the Sun's [Mg/Si] can be found from the given nMg and nFe.

Wait, wait. Let me think: The Sun's nMg is 1e-5 *n_H_sun, and nFe is 1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

So the Sun's [Mg/Fe] = log(nMg/nFe) = log( (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) ) = log(1e-0.5) )= -0.5.

Wait, because [Mg/Fe] is log(nMg/nFe) relative to the Sun, which is the same as log(nMg/nFe)_sun, which is log(1e-0.5) = -0.5.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful. Alternatively, perhaps I can find [Si/Fe]_sun using another approach.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I can express the ratios in terms of H, Fe, and Mg, and find a relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find n_Si1 in terms of n_Fe1, and n_Si2 in terms of n_Mg2, then find the ratio.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{ [Si/Fe]_1 + [Si/Fe]_sun }

But I don't know [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, maybe [Si/Fe]_sun can be found if I can relate it to another element. Let's think about the Sun's composition.

In the Sun, the elements are:

n_Fe = 1e-4.5 *n_H
n_Mg = 1e-5 *n_H
n_Si = S *n_H.

What's the Sun's [Mg/Si]?

[Mg/Si]_sun = log(n_Mg/n_Si) - log(n_Mg_sun/n_Si_sun ) = log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun )

Wait, but that's [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun ), because the Sun's values are the reference.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_sun = log( (n_Mg/n_Si)_sun ) - log( same ), so it's zero? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun → which would be zero if you're comparing the same star. But for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is log(n_X/n_Y)_sun - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun =0.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the notation again.

[X/Y] is a logarithmic abundance ratio. For the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is zero because it's the reference point.

So, [X/Y]_sun =0.

Wait, no, because when you take [X/Y], it's log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So if the star is the Sun, then it's log(n_X/n_Y)_sun - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun =0.

So, in the Sun, any [X/Y] is zero.

So, for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun =0.

Wait, but in the problem, Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. Which is higher than the Sun's, meaning Mg is more abundant relative to Si in Star_2 compared to the Sun.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Sun's [Mg/Fe] and [Si/Fe] to find [Mg/Si]_sun.

Because [Mg/Si]_sun = [Mg/Fe]_sun - [Si/Fe]_sun.

Wait, let me think.

[Mg/Si] = [Mg/Fe] - [Si/Fe].

Because [Mg/Si] = log(n_Mg/n_Si) = log( (n_Mg/n_Fe) * (n_Fe/n_Si) ) ) = log(n_Mg/n_Fe) + log(n_Fe/n_Si ) = [Mg/Fe] + [Fe/Si] = [Mg/Fe] - [Si/Fe].

So, [Mg/Si]_sun = [Mg/Fe]_sun - [Si/Fe]_sun.

But because [Mg/Si]_sun is zero (since it's the Sun), we have:

0 = [Mg/Fe]_sun - [Si/Fe]_sun → [Si/Fe]_sun = [Mg/Fe]_sun.

Hmm, but what is [Mg/Fe]_sun?

Earlier, I think I found that [Mg/Fe]_sun is log(n_Mg/n_Fe)_sun.

n_Mg_sun =1e-5 *n_H_sun,

n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

So n_Mg/n_Fe = (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) )= 1e-0.5 = approx 0.316.

So log(0.316 )= log(1e-0.5 )= -0.5.

So [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5.

Therefore, [Si/Fe]_sun = [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5.

So [Si/Fe]_sun = -0.5.

Okay, that's a breakthrough. So now, for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = [Si/Fe]_sun + 0.3 = (-0.5) +0.3 = -0.2.

So n_Si1/n_Fe1 = 10^(-0.2) ≈0.63096.

So n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 0.63096.

Similarly, for Star_1:

We know that [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

But without knowing n_H1, maybe I can proceed by expressing n_Si1 in terms of n_H1.

Wait, but I need to find the ratio n_Si1 /n_Si2.

So let's find expressions for n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of other elements, then take their ratio.

Let me try.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10^{-0.2} =n_Fe1 * 0.63096.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

So n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5 *n_H_sun /n_H_sun ) *n_H1 =1e-4.5 *n_H1.

So n_Fe1 =1e-4.5 *n_H1.

So n_Si1 = (1e-4.5 *n_H1) ) *0.63096 = 0.63096 *1e-4.5 *n_H1.

Now, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) = [Mg/Si]_sun +0.3 → [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, so log(nMg2/nSi2) = 0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 =10^0.3 ≈ 2.0.

So nMg2 =2.0 *nSi2.

But we also know that [Mg/H]_2 =0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So nMg2 = (1e-5 *nH_sun ) *nH2 /nH_sun )=1e-5 *nH2.

So nMg2=1e-5 *nH2.

But from earlier, nMg2=2.0 *nSi2 → 1e-5 *nH2 =2.0 *nSi2 → nSi2= (1e-5 /2.0 ) *nH2 =5e-6 *nH2.

So now, I have expressions for n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms of their respective nH.

But I need the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2.

So:

n_Si1 =0.63096 *1e-4.5 *nH1.

n_Si2 =5e-6 *nH2.

So the ratio is (0.63096 *1e-4.5 *nH1 ) / (5e-6 *nH2 ).

Hmm, but this includes nH1 and nH2, which are the number densities of hydrogen in each star. I don't have their values, but perhaps I can find a way to express the ratio without them.

Wait, but wait! Since both stars are main-sequence stars (I think they are, given the context), their surface gravities and temperatures would relate to their masses. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of hydrogen in the two stars is the same as the ratio of their masses or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to assume that the hydrogen density ratio can be found using the mass ratio and some scaling from the Sun.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let's see if there's another way. Maybe the ratio of nH1 and nH2 can be expressed using the stars' masses.

Wait, but without knowing the exact scaling, perhaps the ratio of nH1/nH2 is equal to the ratio of the stars' hydrogen masses divided by their respective total masses. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that for main-sequence stars, the number density of hydrogen is proportional to the mass of the star and inversely proportional to the volume. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the fact that for each star, the number density of hydrogen (n_H) would be proportional to the star's mass and inversely proportional to its volume. But the volume of a star is roughly (radius)^3, and radius depends on mass. For main-sequence stars, radius scales roughly as mass^alpha, where alpha is about 1 (for stars similar to the Sun, perhaps a bit higher). But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the hydrogen ratio and proceed under the assumption that nH1 =nH2, which wouldn't be correct, but maybe it's a simplification.

Wait, but that would be incorrect because more massive stars have different surface gravities and thus different densities, but perhaps the problem expects us to proceed without considering that.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to express the ratio nH1/nH2 in terms of the stars' masses, given that they are on the main sequence.

Wait, main-sequence stars have mass-luminosity and mass-radius relationships. The typical relations are L ∝ M^3 and R ∝ M^something, perhaps R ~ M^0.8 or M^1.

If I can model the stars as having R proportional to M^alpha, then the density (rho) would be M/(R^3), so rho ~ M/(M^(3 alpha)) )= M^(1-3 alpha).

For the Sun, R is about 1 solar radius. For more massive stars, R increases, but not as rapidly as mass. So for a star with mass M, R ~ M^beta, where beta is around 1 (for higher mass stars, maybe beta is 1).

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact scaling. Let's see, for stars with masses similar to the Sun, R is roughly proportional to M^0.8. So R ~ M^0.8.

So volume is proportional to R^3 → M^2.4.

Density (rho) is mass/volume → M/(M^2.4) )= M^{-1.4}.

So density decreases with increasing mass.

But n_H is proportional to rho, so n_H1/n_H2 = (rho1)/(rho2) )= (M2^{1.4}) / (M1^{1.4} ) ) )= (M2/M1)^1.4.

Wait, but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, maybe I should assume that the surface gravity affects the number density, but without more information, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore this and proceed under the assumption that nH is the same for both stars. But that doesn't make sense because the stars have different masses.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Maybe the problem doesn't require knowing the exact ratio of nH1 and nH2, but perhaps the ratio of n_Si1 and n_Si2 can be expressed in terms that cancel out nH.

Wait, let's write the ratio again.

n_Si1 /n_Si2 = [0.63096 *1e-4.5 *nH1 ] / [5e-6 *nH2 ]

Simplify this:

= (0.63096 /5e-6) * 1e-4.5 * (nH1/nH2 )

= (0.63096 / 5e-6 ) * 1e-4.5 * (nH1/nH2 )

Calculating the constants:

0.63096 /5e-6 = 0.63096 / 0.000005 = 126192.

126192 * 1e-4.5 = 126192 * 3.1623e-5 ≈ 126192 * 3.1623e-5.

Let me compute that:

3.1623e-5 is approximately 0.000031623.

126192 * 0.000031623 ≈ 4.

So the constants multiply to about 4.

So the ratio becomes approximately 4 * (nH1/nH2 ).

But without knowing nH1/nH2, I'm stuck.

Wait, but perhaps nH1/nH2 can be expressed in terms of the stars' masses. Since the stars are more massive, their photospheric density is lower. Because higher mass stars have larger radii and lower surface gravity.

But perhaps, using the mass-luminosity relation and mass-radius relation, we can relate nH1 and nH2.

Wait, perhaps nH is proportional to the number density of hydrogen, which depends on the star's mass and radius.

The number density n_H is given by n_H = (M_H ) / ( (4/3)π R^3 ), where M_H is the mass of hydrogen in the photosphere. But this approach would require knowing the exact mass of hydrogen in each star's photosphere, which we don't have.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's assumed that the ratio nH1/nH2 = (M1/M2) ) because the problem gives the masses of the stars as 1.5 and 1.2 solar masses.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that nH is the same for both stars, which would make the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2=4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. So maybe the answer is A) ~3.9.

But I'm not fully confident. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem does not require considering the hydrogen ratio because it cancels out when taking the ratio of the two stars. But in the equation I had, the ratio depends on nH1/nH2, which I can't determine without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the ratio of nH1 to nH2 is (M1/M2), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the stars.

So M1=1.5, M2=1.2 → M1/M2=1.25.

So nH1/nH2=1.25 → then the ratio becomes 4 *1.25=5.

But 5 is not one of the options.

Wait, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the ratio of the number densities of H is the same as the ratio of the masses, assuming that the volume is the same, which is not the case.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, another approach. Let me find the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star and then compare them.

For Star_1:

n_Si1 = n_Fe1 *10^{ [Si/Fe]_1 }

But wait, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, so n_Si1 = n_Fe1 *10^{0.3}.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun /n_H_sun) *n_H1.

n_Fe_sun =1e-4.5 *n_H_sun.

So n_Fe1 = (1e-4.5) *n_H1.

So n_Si1 = 1e-4.5 *n_H1 *10^{0.3}.

n_Si1 =1e-4.5 *1.995 *n_H1.

So n_Si1/n_H1 =1e-4.5 *1.995.

Similarly, for Star_2:

n_Si2 =n_Mg2 /10^{ [Mg/Si]_2 }.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(n_Mg2/n_Si2)=0.3 → n_Mg2= n_Si2 *10^{0.3}.

But we also know from [Mg/H]_2=0 → n_Mg2 =n_Mg_sun * (n_H2/n_H_sun).

n_Mg_sun=1e-5 *n_H_sun.

So n_Mg2=1e-5 *n_H2.

So 1e-5 *n_H2 =n_Si2 *10^{0.3} → n_Si2= (1e-5 / 10^{0.3} ) *n_H2.

Compute 10^{0.3} ≈2. So n_Si2= (1e-5 /2 ) *n_H2 =5e-6 *n_H2.

So n_Si2/n_H2 =5e-6.

Now, the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si1/n_Si2) = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2).

Wait, no. Let me think again: n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2).

Because n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H2/n_Si2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write as:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think:

n_Si1 = (n_Si1/n_H1) *n_H1.

n_Si2 = (n_Si2/n_H2) *n_H2.

So n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) * (n_H1/n_Si2) ) * (n_H2) ?

Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Wait, perhaps better to write:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2).

Because:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = [ (n_Si1/n_H1) *n_H1 ] / [ (n_Si2/n_H2) *n_H2 ].

Which can be rewritten as (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2).

So the ratio is (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H1/n_H2).

We can compute (n_Si1/n_H1) and (n_Si2/n_H2):

n_Si1/n_H1 =1e-4.5 *10^{0.3} ≈1e-4.5 *2 ≈ 2e-4.5 ≈ 2 * 3.16e-5 ≈6.32e-5.

n_Si2/n_H2 =5e-6.

So (n_Si1/n_H1)/(n_Si2/n_H2) = (6.32e-5) / (5e-6) )= approx 12.64.

So the ratio becomes 12.64 * (n_H1/n_H2).

Now, I need to find (n_H1/n_H2).

But without knowing the actual number densities of H in each star, perhaps I can express this ratio in terms of the stars' masses, assuming that the number density of H is inversely proportional to the mass of the star.

Wait, why? Because a more massive star would have a higher gravitational pull, leading to higher density. But higher mass stars are also larger in radius, which might lower the density. Hmm, perhaps the number density of H is proportional to (mass of star) / (radius^3).

But without knowing the radius of each star, this might be difficult. But perhaps, using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relations, I can find an approximate ratio.

The mass-luminosity relation is L ∝ M^3.5, and the mass-radius relation is R ∝ M^0.8.

So for Star_1 (1.5 Msun) and Star_2 (1.2 Msun):

R1 = R_sun * (1.5)^0.8 → approx 1.5^0.8 ≈1.38.

R2 = R_sun * (1.2)^0.8 → approx 1.2^0.8 ≈1.16.

So Volume1 = (R1)^3 ≈ (1.38)^3 ≈2.62.

Volume2= (R2)^3 ≈(1.16)^3≈1.56.

Now, the number density of H, n_H, is proportional to mass of H divided by volume.

Assuming that the mass of H in each star is proportional to the star's total mass (since more massive stars have more hydrogen), so M1=1.5, M2=1.2.

n_H1 ∝ M1/(R1^3) → n_H1 ∝ 1.5 / 2.62 ≈0.5725.

n_H2 ∝ M2/(R2^3) → n_H2 ∝1.2 /1.56≈0.7692.

So n_H1/n_H2 = (0.5725)/(0.7692) ≈0.744.

So putting it all together:

n_Si1/n_Si2 =12.64 * 0.744 ≈9.4.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, C) ~0.8, D) ~1.2.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dependence on hydrogen number density and assume that the ratio is simply 12.64, which would be option B.

Wait, but the calculation without considering nH gives 12.64, which is option B. But earlier, when I thought the ratio was 4, when I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me re-examine the earlier step where I computed the ratio.

Previously, I had:

n_Si1/n_Si2 = (0.63096 *1e-4.5 *nH1 ) / (5e-6 *nH2 )

Which simplifies to (0.63096 /5e-6) * (1e-4.5) * (nH1/nH2 )

Wait, 0.63096 /5e-6 is 0.63096 /0.000005 = 126192.

1e-4.5 is 3.1623e-5.

So 126192 *3.1623e-5 ≈ (126192 *3.1623 ) *1e-5.

126192 *3 =378576, 126192 *0.1623≈20480 → total ≈ 399,056 *1e-5 = 3.99056.

So 3.99056 * (nH1/nH2).

If nH1/nH2 is 1, then the ratio is 4.

But if we consider that with the mass and radius relations, n_H1/n_H2 is 0.744, then the ratio is ~3.99 *0.744≈ 3.0.

But option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. So perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the nH ratio and just take 4, leading to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in including the (nH1/nH2) term because the ratio of silicon to hydrogen in each star is already accounted for, and the stars' nH would cancel out.

Wait, let me think again. The ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 is:

(n_Si1 /n_H1 ) * (n_H1 / n_H2 ) * (n_H2 /n_Si2 )

Which can be written as (n_Si1/n_H1 ) / (n_Si2/n_H2 ) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 ) * (n_H1/n_Si2 )? No, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the expressions I have.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the hydrogen density ratio, assuming that nH1 and nH2 are the same. If that's the case, then the ratio is 12.64, which is option B.

But that seems high. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [Si/Fe]_sun. Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I found that [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5, and [Mg/Si]_sun =0.

So [Mg/Si]_sun = [Mg/Fe]_sun - [Si/Fe]_sun → 0 = (-0.5) - [Si/Fe]_sun → [Si/Fe]_sun= -0.5.

That seems correct.

So, with that, the calculations for each star are correct.

Another approach: perhaps the problem expects us to compute the ratio of [Si/H] in each star and then compute the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 as ( [Si/H]_1 / [Si/H]_2 ) * (n_H1/n_H2 ).

Wait, because [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_H1) - [Si/H]_sun.

But [Si/H]_sun is zero because it's the Sun's ratio.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_H1) → n_Si1/n_H1 =10^{[Si/H]_1}.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 = log(n_Si2/n_H2) → n_Si2/n_H2 =10^{[Si/H]_2}.

Then, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 = (n_Si1/n_H1) / (n_Si2/n_H2) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 ).

Which is (10^{[Si/H]_1} ) / (10^{[Si/H]_2} ) ) * (n_H2/n_H1 )

= 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } * (n_H2/n_H1 )

Now, I need to find [Si/H] for each star.

For Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe1/n_H1 =n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun.

n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) *n_H1.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(n_Si1/n_Fe1 ) =0.3 + [Si/Fe]_sun → 0.3 + (-0.5 )= -0.2.

So n_Si1/n_Fe1 =10^{-0.2} ≈0.63096.

So n_Si1 =0.63096 *n_Fe1.

But n_Fe1 = (n_Fe_sun/n_H_sun ) *n_H1 =1e-4.5 *n_H1.

So n_Si1 =0.63096 *1e-4.5 *n_H1.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(n_Si1/n_H1 ) = log(0.63096 *1e-4.5 )= log( 6.3096e-5 )= log(6.3096 ) + log(1e-5 )= 0.7993 -5 = -4.2007.

So [Si/H]_1≈-4.2.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 →nMg2= n_Si2 *10^{0.3} →nMg2=2.0 *n_Si2.

Also, [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg2/n_H2 =nMg_sun/n_H_sun =1e-5.

So, 2.0 *n_Si2 =1e-5 *n_H2 →n_Si2 = (1e-5 /2.0 ) *n_H2 =5e-6 *n_H2.

So n_Si2/n_H2 =5e-6.

So [Si/H]_2 = log(5e-6 )= log(5 ) + log(1e-6 )=0.69897 -6= -5.30103.

So [Si/H]_2≈-5.3.

Now, the ratio n_Si1/n_Si2 =10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } * (n_H2/n_H1 )

=10^{ (-4.2) - (-5.3) } * (n_H2/n_H1 ) = 10^{1.1} * (n_H2/n_H1 ).

10^1.1 ≈12.589 → approximately 12.59.

So n_Si1/n_Si2 ≈12.59 * (n_H2/n_H1 )

But without knowing n_H2/n_H1, I can't compute the exact ratio.

But perhaps, using the mass and radius relations as before, n_H is proportional to (M/(R^3)).

M1=1.5, R1=1.5^0.8≈1.38; so R1^3≈2.62.

n_H1 ∝ 1.5/2.62≈0.572.

Similarly, M2=1.2, R2=1.2^0.8≈1.16; R2^3≈1.56.

n_H2 ∝1.2/1.56≈0.769.

So n_H2/n_H1 ≈0.769/0.572≈1.344.

So the ratio becomes 12.59 *1.344≈16.93.

But that's not among the options. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the stars have the same surface gravity, which would imply same n_H. But that's probably not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the n_H ratio and just take the ratio of [Si/H] as 10^{1.1}=12.6, which is option B.

But earlier, when I computed the ratio without considering nH, it was 12.6.

So perhaps the correct answer is B) ~12.6.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

[Si/H]_1 =-4.2 → [Si/H]_2 =-5.3 → difference is +1.1.

10^1.1 ≈12.6.

So the ratio is 12.6 times (n_H2/n_H1 ).

If we assume that the number densities of H are the same, n_H2/n_H1=1 → ratio is12.6, which is option B.

But the problem gives the stars' masses, which suggest that their H densities are different. So why would the problem expect us to assume n_H1 =n_H2? Perhaps it's a simplification.

But in reality, n_H depends on the star's mass and radius, which affects the surface gravity and density. So perhaps the problem expects us to recognize that the ratio of [Si/H]_1 to [Si/H]_2 is 10^{1.1}=12.6, making the ratio of Si atoms 12.6.

Looking at the options, option B is ~12.6.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given abundance data and apply the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios. The key steps and calculations are as follows:

---

### **Key Data and Definitions**
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun
   - [Fe/H] = log(n_Fe/n_H) - log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - [Mg/Si] = log(n_Mg/n_Si) - log(n_Mg/n_Si)_sun
   - [Mg/H] = log(n_Mg/n_H) - log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun

3. **Sun's Photospheric Composition**:
   - 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 → log10(n_Fe/n_H) = -4.5
   - 12 + log10(n_Mg/n_H) = 7 → log10(n_Mg/n_H) = -5

---

### **Step 1: Determine [Si/Fe]_sun**
Using the Sun's composition:
- n_Fe_sun = 10^(-4.5) × n_H_sun
- n_Mg_sun = 10^(-5) × n_H_sun

The Sun's [Mg/Fe] is:
\[
[Mg/Fe]_sun = \log\left(\frac{n_Mg/n_H}{n_Fe/n_H}\right) = \log\left(\frac{10^{-5}}{10^{-4.5}}\right) = \log(10^{-0.5}) = -0.5
\]

From the relationship:
\[
[Mg/Si]_sun = [Mg/Fe]_sun - [Si/Fe]_sun
\]
and knowing \([Mg/Si]_sun = 0\), we find:
\[
[Si/Fe]_sun = [Mg/Fe]_sun = -0.5
\]

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Silicon-to-Iron Ratios**
For **Star_1**:
\[
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 = \log\left(\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Fe1}}\right) - [Si/Fe]_sun
\]
\[
\log\left(\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Fe1}}\right) = 0.3 + (-0.5) = -0.2
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Fe1}} = 10^{-0.2} \approx 0.631
\]

For **Star_2**:
\[
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 = \log\left(\frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{Si2}}\right) - [Mg/Si]_sun
\]
\[
\log\left(\frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{Si2}}\right) = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{Si2}} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2.0
\]

---

### **Step 3: Relate Silicon to Hydrogen**
For **Star_1**:
Using \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\):
\[
\log\left(\frac{n_{Fe1}}{n_{H1}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{Fe,sun}}{n_{H,sun}}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Fe1}}{n_{H1}} = \frac{n_{Fe,sun}}{n_{H,sun}}
\]
\[
n_{Fe1} = n_{Fe,sun} \cdot \frac{n_{H1}}{n_{H,sun}}
\]
\[
n_{Si1} = n_{Fe1} \cdot 0.631 = n_{Fe,sun} \cdot 0.631 \cdot \frac{n_{H1}}{n_{H,sun}}
\]

For **Star_2**:
Using \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\):
\[
\log\left(\frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{H2}}\right) = \log\left(\frac{n_{Mg,sun}}{n_{H,sun}}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Mg2}}{n_{H2}} = \frac{n_{Mg,sun}}{n_{H,sun}}
\]
\[
n_{Mg2} = n_{Mg,sun} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H,sun}}
\]
\[
n_{Si2} = \frac{n_{Mg2}}{2.0} = \frac{n_{Mg,sun}}{2.0} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H,sun}}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Ratio of Silicon Atoms**
The ratio of silicon atoms is:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{n_{Si1}/n_{H1}}{n_{Si2}/n_{H2}} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(n_{Si1}\) and \(n_{Si2}\):
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{(n_{Fe,sun} \cdot 0.631 \cdot \frac{n_{H1}}{n_{H,sun}})/n_{H1}}{(n_{Mg,sun}/2.0 \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H,sun}})/n_{H2}} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{0.631 \cdot n_{Fe,sun}}{0.5 \cdot n_{Mg,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]

Using \(n_{Fe,sun} = 10^{-4.5} \cdot n_{H,sun}\) and \(n_{Mg,sun} = 10^{-5} \cdot n_{H,sun}\):
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{0.631 \cdot 10^{-4.5}}{0.5 \cdot 10^{-5}} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = \frac{0.631}{0.5} \cdot 10^{-4.5 + 5} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 1.262 \cdot 10^{0.5} \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} = 1.262 \cdot 3.162 \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} \approx 3.99 \cdot \frac{n_{H2}}{n_{H1}}
\]

---

### **Step 5: Simplify Assuming \(n_{H1} = n_{H2}\)**
If the problem assumes the hydrogen number densities are the same (\(n_{H1} = n_{H2}\)), then:
\[
\frac{n_{Si1}}{n_{Si2}} \approx 4
\]

This matches **Option A (~3.9)**.

---

### **Final Answer**
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
