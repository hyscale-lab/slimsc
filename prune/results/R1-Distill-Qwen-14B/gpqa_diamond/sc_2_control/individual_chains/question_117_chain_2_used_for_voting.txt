Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism where the compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. This usually happens when the molecule has chiral centers or some kind of stereogenic elements like planes or axes.

The question gives four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings are connected by a single bond, right? So the two phenyl rings can rotate around the central bond. If there are substituents on each ring that are in positions that are not equivalent, like 6 and 2 positions, maybe they can create some kind of geometric isomerism. Wait, but optical isomerism is about stereoisomerism, which requires either a chiral center or some kind of axial chirality.

In biphenyl systems, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, it could lead to enantiomers. For example, if one of the substituents is on opposite sides, that might create a chiral environment. But in this case, the substituents are at 6 and 6' as well as 2 and 2'. So the nitro groups are at the 6 positions, which are across from each other, and the carboxylate groups are at 2 and 2'. Wait, 2 on each ring—so on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Hmm.

Wait, wait. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it should have a chiral center or some other feature that makes it asymmetrical. Let's think: the biphenyl structure. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, maybe it can have enantiomers.

Alternatively, if the two rings have substituents that are in a trans configuration, perhaps leading to axial chirality. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think biphenyls can have cis and trans arrangements, but whether that leads to optical isomerism depends on whether the molecule has a center of symmetry or not.

Wait, if substituents are at 2 and 2' positions on each ring, and 6 and 6' are nitro groups. Wait, maybe each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions. So on each ring, the substituents are at para positions, but across the two rings, their arrangement might create a chiral center.

Alternatively, maybe each ring has a substituent at 2 and 6, but if the two substituents on each ring are in a way that when you rotate the central bond, the overall structure could have two enantiomers. I'm not entirely sure about this one. Maybe I'll come back to it.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with a methyl ester. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be something like CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH3-C(O-)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-, but with a methyl ester. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So that's a structure where the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon of the propanoate.

Wait, the carbonyl is at the end, so the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3? No, wait, wait: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, maybe not. Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, wait, maybe I should think of the structure as the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the structure would be:

The acid is HOCH2CH2COOH, but as an ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. If the OH is on the second carbon, then it's HOCH2CH2COOH. As an ester, that would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in that molecule, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Does this have a chiral center? Let's see: the central carbon (the one attached to OH and two CH2 groups and the carbonyl) would have four different groups. Wait no, wait. Let me count the groups attached to the second carbon.

The carbon chain is: COOCH3 is the first carbon (carbonyl), then the second is CH2 attached to OH and another CH2, which is attached to the COOCH3. Wait, no. Maybe I should number the carbons. The ester group is the COOCH3, which is on the first carbon. Then the second carbon is the one with the hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

COOCH3 - CH(OH) - CH2 - ?

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, that would be another structure. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the structure. Let's think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy means the hydroxyl is on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

O=C-OCH3 is the first carbon.

Then the second carbon is CH2 attached to the OH and the first and third carbons.

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the two CH2 groups are adjacent.

Wait, regardless, the key thing is: does the molecule have a chiral center?

In the molecule methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the 2-hydroxypropanoate ion would have a central carbon. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the adjacent carbon is CH2, which is attached to the OH and another CH2. Wait, that would mean the central carbon is CH2. No, wait, maybe not. Let's think about the substituents.

Wait, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the two CH2 groups are connected to the carbonyl group. So the structure is:

COOCH3 is the first carbon.

The second carbon is CH2.

The third carbon is CH2OH.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the molecule a three-carbon chain with the ester group on the first carbon, a CH2 on the second, and CH2OH on the third. That would make the structure: 

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain? No, wait, the propanoate is three carbons. So:

Propanoate: CH2CH2COO- → when esterified with methyl, it's CH2CH2COOCH3. But with a hydroxyl on the second carbon, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is: 

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH2-

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

CH2(OH)CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxyl group. The groups attached to this carbon are:

- OH

- CH2COOCH3

- two CH2 groups (wait, no. Let's see: the carbon with the OH is connected to two CH2 groups and the COOCH3 group.)

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2COOCH3, where one of the CH2 groups has an OH attached. So the central carbon is CH2 with OH, connected to another CH2, which is connected to COOCH3.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to number the carbons. Let's see:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (carbonyl carbon).

Carbon 2: connected to carbon 1 and 3. So it's CH2.

Carbon 3: connected to carbon 2 and has an OH group.

Wait, but that would make the structure: COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH. But that's a three-carbon chain, so that would be propanoate with a hydroxyl on the third carbon, but wait, the name is 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the hydroxyl is on the second carbon.

So the correct structure is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH).

Carbon 3: CH3? No, wait. Let me think again. Propanoate is three carbons: 1, 2, 3. The ester is OMe attached to the 3rd carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the formula for propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. So the 1st carbon is the COOCH3, the 2nd is CH2, and the 3rd is CH2.

But if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the OH is on the 2nd carbon.

So the structure is: 

COOCH3-CH(OH)-CH2-?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me try to visualize it.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. So the carbons are:

1: COOCH3

2: CH2

3: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The ester would be CH3CH2COOCH3. So for 2-hydroxypropanoate, the OH is on the middle CH2. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbon chain is:

COOCH3 connected to CH2, which is connected to CH2OH.

So the carbon with the hydroxyl group (the 2nd carbon) is attached to:

- a CH2 group connected to the COOCH3.

- a CH2 group connected to the OH.

Wait, no, the 2nd carbon is attached to:

- the COOCH3 (from the first carbon).

- two CH2 groups (the third carbon and the first).

Wait, no, not quite. Let me see: the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Breaking it down:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (i.e., the carbonyl group attached to OCH3).

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3: CH2OH.

So Carbon 2 has four substituents: COOCH3, two CH2 groups (Carbon 1 and Carbon 3), and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, Carbon 2 is CH2, which is connected to Carbon 1 (COOCH3), Carbon 3 (CH2OH), and two hydrogens.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps Carbon 2 is CH(OH), but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the actual structure again. Let's try to write the Lewis structure.

The ester group is OCOOCH3. So the ester is at the end. Then, the propanoate is three carbons: the first is the carbonyl (COOCH3), the second is CH2, the third is CH2OH.

So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate? No, because the OH is on the third carbon. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

No, wait, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate as O=C-OCH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the structure as propanoate with a hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (from the first carbon),

- two CH2 groups (to the first and third carbons),

- and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, no. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So the second carbon in this structure is connected to:

- COOCH3 (from the first carbon),

- a CH2 group (third carbon),

- two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that's not possible because then the second carbon would only have three substituents. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting the structure right.

Alternatively, perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (carbon 1)
|
CH(OH)CH3 (carbon 2 and 3).

Wait, that would make the structure O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the structure would be:

O=C-O-CH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So the carbon attached to the ester is the same as the carbon attached to the OH and the CH3 group. So that carbon has four substituents: the ester group, the OH group, the CH3 group, and another CH3 group? No, that can't be right because it would be a quaternary carbon, which isn't possible for a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify: the correct IUPAC name for the ester would help. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (second) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),

- CH2COOCH3,

- two hydrogens.

Wait, but that would make the groups on the second carbon: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So that's three different groups plus the hydrogen? No, wait, four substituents: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. But that's not four different groups. So the second carbon would be CH2(OH), but it's attached to two H's and two CH2 groups. So it can't be a chiral center because two of the substituents are the same (two H's). So the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, meaning it can't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me recount.

In the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, the second carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (one toward COOCH3, the other toward the CH2OH),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think of each carbon in the chain:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3: CH2OH.

Wait, that can't be right because the 3rd carbon would be CH2OH, but that's four substituents: OH, two CH2's, and a H.

Wait, no. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Let's number from the ester end. So the ester is on Carbon 1. Then, Carbon 2 is the next one, which has the hydroxyl. So the structure would be:

Carbon 1: COOCH3.

Carbon 2: CH(OH).

Carbon 3: CH3.

Wait, that doesn't seem right either. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (Carbon 1)

|
CH(OH) (Carbon 2)

|
CH3 (Carbon 3)

So in this case, Carbon 2 is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- CH3,

- and another CH3.

Wait, that can't be because that would make two CH3 groups, so the substituents are not all different. So Carbon 2 would have two CH3 groups, making it impossible to be a chiral center.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the structure as:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle CH2: so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

In this case, the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- COOCH3 (from Carbon 1),

- two CH2 groups (Carbon 1 and Carbon 3),

- and an OH.

Wait, but that would give it four substituents: COOCH3, two CH2's, and OH. So substituents are: COOCH3, CH2CH3, H, OH? No, wait, no. The substituents would be:

- COOCH3,

- a CH2 group,

- another CH2 group,

- and an OH.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the two CH2 groups would be identical. So the substituents would be:

- COOCH3,

- two identical CH2 groups,

- OH.

So the second carbon is attached to COOCH3, two CH2 groups (same), and OH. Therefore, it's not a chiral center because there are two identical substituents (the two CH2 groups). So in this case, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center and hence cannot exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm not so sure now. Let me think again.

Wait, the second carbon is attached to:

1. COOCH3 group (from Carbon 1),

2. a CH2 group leading to Carbon 3 (which is CH2OH),

3. another CH2 group leading to Carbon 1,

4. and an OH group.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the second carbon is connected to two CH2 groups, one on each side. So, the groups would be:

- COOCH3,

- CH2OH,

- two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that's not possible. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

In this case, the second carbon (the CH2 between the OH and COOCH3) is connected to:

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that again would have two identical substituents (the two CH2's), so no chiral center.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule does have a chiral center. Let me think about the actual structure again. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is also known as glyceric acid, I think. Or wait, no, glyceric acid is HOOCCH(OH)CH2OH. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure.

Wait, another approach: if the molecule has a chiral center, it will have optical isomerism. So if the second carbon has four different substituents, it's a chiral center.

So in the case of 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the second carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- two different groups (like CH3 and something else), then it would be a chiral center.

Wait, but in the structure I'm thinking, the second carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- two CH2 groups (which are the same).

So no, it's not a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have optical isomerism. But wait, I thought earlier that it might have a chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. That would make the second carbon (CHOH) attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH group (CH-).

Wait, no. Let me think: in this structure, the second carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH2 group? No, that's not right. Alternatively, in CH3-CHOH-COOCH3, the second carbon is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another CH2 group? I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's best to move on and come back to this after evaluating the other options.

3. The third compound is benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, where Ph is phenyl. So the structure is two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The molecule is symmetrical because the two phenyl groups are identical and attached to the same carbon. So there's a plane of symmetry through the ketone group, making it achiral. Therefore, benzophenone cannot exhibit optical isomerism because it has a plane of symmetry, so any mirror image would be identical to the original molecule. So this one doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. The fourth compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOCCHCHCOOH with the double bond in the trans configuration. The dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. So the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate has two double bonds? No, wait, fumarate is an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid. Its structure is HOOCCH=CHCOOH, with the double bond in the trans configuration. The dimethyl ester would replace the -OH of each carboxylic acid with OCH3, so the structure is O=C(OCH3)CH=CHCOOCH3, with the double bond in the trans configuration.

Now, for optical isomerism, we need to look for either a chiral center or some kind of axial chirality. In this case, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on both sides. Let's see: each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group.

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (from the first COOCH3)

CH2=CH

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (from the second COOCH3)

Wait, no, that's not correct. Fumarate is trans, so the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

No, wait, fumarate is (E) configuration, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to a CH group.

The double bond is CH-CH, with each CH attached to a COOCH3 and a methyl group? No, wait, no methyl groups. The structure is CH2=CH.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The dimethyl ester would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me.

So each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. It's COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So in the ester form, it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-O-C=O? No, no, the double bond is between the two CH groups, each attached to a COOCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2=CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. The double bond is between the two central carbons. So it's CH-CH, with each CH attached to a COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has two identical groups on each carbon of the double bond. So each carbon of the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each carbon in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 and another group. For fumarate, the structure is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides. But wait, each carbon of the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group? No, perhaps it's better to say that each carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it's in the trans configuration, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But wait, in the case of fumarate, the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think: in the trans configuration, each of the two carbonyl groups are on opposite sides. So the molecule may not have a plane of symmetry, leading to the possibility of optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, and both are stereoisomers. But they are not optical isomers because they are not mirror images of each other. They are geometric isomers. Wait, no, wait. No, fumarate and maleate are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. Optical isomerism requires that the mirror image is not the same as the original. But in the case of fumarate, the molecule itself may be asymmetrical, allowing it to have enantiomers.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the structure of dimethyl fumarate. The molecule is (E)-dimethyl 2,3-fumarate. The structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH group, which is double-bonded to another CH group connected to O=C-OCH3. In the trans configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry?

If the molecule is in the trans configuration, each carbon of the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 and a H. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the double bond, making it achiral. Wait, but that's not correct because in the trans configuration, the substituents are across from each other, but if they are the same, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. But in this case, the substituents are the same (each COOCH3), so the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are the same, then the molecule can't be chiral because it's superimposable on its mirror image. So dimethyl fumarate is a trans double bond with identical substituents on each end, making it achiral. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. No, the substituents on each end are the same, so the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. So why is dimethyl fumarate known for optical isomerism?

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let's think: the molecule has two COOCH3 groups on each end of the double bond. So if the double bond is in the trans configuration, the molecule would look like:

O=C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O=C-OCH3

But in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. So it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate is achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I thought fumarate was a chiral molecule. Wait, maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing fumarate with some other compound. Wait, wait. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. Its structure is HOOCCH=CHCOOH. So when you make the dimethyl ester, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3. Wait, no, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond.

So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in the trans configuration, each of the COOCH3 groups is on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm recalling that some compounds with double bonds can have E/Z isomerism, but that's geometric isomerism, not optical. So dimethyl fumarate would have E and Z isomers, but not optical isomers.

Wait, but I also remember that some diesters, like dimethyl maleate, are chiral. Wait, no, maleate is the cis isomer, which would have a different structure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again: maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid, and fumaric is (E). The dimethyl esters would retain the configuration. So in the case of dimethyl maleate, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So each carbon is attached to COOCH3 and another COOCH3 group. Wait, no, each carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a hydrogen. Wait, no, in maleate, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl maleate is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond, and in the cis configuration. So the substituents are on the same side, making the molecule chiral.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. Let me clarify. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry. So in the case of dimethyl maleate, the substituents are on the same side. Does that create a chiral center?

Wait, the molecule is:

O=C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O=C-OCH3

But in the cis configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side. So the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to the possibility of optical isomerism. So dimethyl maleate is chiral and exhibits optical isomerism.

But wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer, which would have the COOCH3 groups on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical and thus achiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism, but dimethyl maleate does.

Wait, but the question asks about dimethyl fumarate. So in this case, dimethyl fumarate (trans) is achiral, so it doesn't show optical isomerism. Therefore, option 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the substituents in fumarate are same on both sides, making it symmetrical. So no optical isomerism. So now, looking back at the options, let's reevaluate each option.

Now, going back to the options:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

This compound has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has nitro groups at 6 positions and carboxylate groups at 2 positions. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para positions. The arrangement around the central bond could allow for different stereoisomers. But biphenyl systems can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical.

In this case, each ring has two substituents: nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So on each ring, the substituents are at para positions, but when connected to another ring, perhaps the overall structure is asymmetrical.

Wait, the molecule has two nitro groups at 6,6', and two carboxylate groups at 2,2'. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group para to each other. The question is whether the arrangement around the central bond leads to a chiral axis, making the molecule exhibit optical isomerism.

In such a case, if the two substituents on each ring are in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral. So for example, if the two substituents are in a cis or trans arrangement around the central bond, and the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

But wait, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral. For example, if each ring has the same substituents in the same positions relative to the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

In this compound, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para. So when you look at the biphenyl structure, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group at opposite ends. When connected to the central bond, the orientation of these groups could lead to different stereoisomers.

For example, the nitro groups on each ring are on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) relative to the central bond. If they are on the same side, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical and thus is chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule lack a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group at 6 and 2 positions, which are para. So when considering the arrangement around the central bond, if the substituents on each ring are on the same face, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if they are on opposite faces, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the biphenyl system as having substituents that are in positions that make the molecule not symmetrical. So, for example, if the nitro groups are on the same face (cis) and the carboxylate groups are on the same face, but in a way that creates asymmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each ring's substituents are on opposite faces, leading to a chiral arrangement.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, but I think that this biphenyl compound does exhibit axial chirality, making it optically active. So option 1 does show optical isomerism.

Now, to summarize:

- Option 1: Yes, optical isomerism.

- Option 2: Earlier confusion, but perhaps no. Wait, let me reevaluate.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: if the molecule has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. Let's think again about the structure.

The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The carbon with the OH is the second carbon. The substituents are:

- COOCH3,

- CH2OH,

- two CH2 groups leading to the ester and the next carbon.

Wait, no, perhaps the second carbon is attached to:

- COOCH3,

- CH2CH2 group,

- OH,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- COOCH3,

- OH,

- and another H.

Wait, that's four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. So that would make the second carbon a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, yes! I think I messed up earlier. The correct structure is 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would have the OH on the second carbon, which is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

So option 2 does show optical isomerism.

Option 3: benzophenone has a plane of symmetry, so no optical isomerism.

Option 4: dimethyl fumarate is trans, which makes it symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

So the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 → No, because 4 doesn't.

Option B: 3 and 4 → No.

Option C: 2 and 3 → No.

Option D: 1 and 2 → Yes.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound based on the presence of chirality, which requires the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry and have at least one chiral center or axial chirality.

### 1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
This compound consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at the 6 positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 positions on each ring. The biphenyl system can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the rings are arranged asymmetrically around the central bond. Since the substituents (nitro and carboxylate groups) are not in a symmetrical configuration, the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and can exist as non-superimposable enantiomers.  
**Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### 2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one attached to the hydroxyl group) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, a hydroxyl group, and an ester group. A chiral center enables the molecule to exist as non-superimposable mirror images, making it optically active.  
**Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism.

---

### 3. **Benzophenone**  
Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The molecule is symmetrical, with a plane of symmetry passing through the carbonyl group. Due to this symmetry, the molecule is not chiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.  
**Conclusion:** This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### 4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-isomer of the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. In the (E)-configuration, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, creating a plane of symmetry through the molecule. Since the molecule is symmetrical, it is not chiral and cannot exhibit optical isomerism.  
**Conclusion:** This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

---

### Final Answer  
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1 (dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate)** and **2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)**.  

**Answer: D**
