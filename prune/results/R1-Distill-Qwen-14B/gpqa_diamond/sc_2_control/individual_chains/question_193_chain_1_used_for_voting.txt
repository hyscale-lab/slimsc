Okay, so I have this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me read it again. It says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance per unit range of distance, r? The options are A to D, each with a different power of r.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's calculate that.

So 1/( (1/r)^5 ) equals r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but the question isn't just asking for the proportionality—it's asking how the number changes with distance per unit range. So I think this is about the differential, like the change in N per unit change in r.

Hmm, if N is proportional to r^5, then the derivative dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So I think they're asking for the number of stars in each small slice of space, like a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. Or perhaps the number density as a function of r.

Wait, wait. Let's think about it again. The number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which we found is proportional to r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

But when considering how the number changes with distance, like per unit distance, maybe it's the gradient. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number per unit distance (like stars per parsec) would be N per r, which is 5 r^4. But wait, no, that's the derivative, which tells us the rate of change. But the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe it's about the number of stars in a shell between r and r + dr. So the number in that shell would be proportional to the difference in N between r and r + dr. If N(r) = k r^5, then the number in the shell is dN = k ( (r + dr)^5 - r^5 ). For small dr, this is approximately 5 k r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance is dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance at distance r is proportional to r^4.

Wait, that's making sense. So the number of stars per unit distance (number per parsec) increases with r^4. So if the options have r^4, that's option C.

Wait, but I need to make sure I'm answering the question correctly. The question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r?)". So, per unit distance, the number is proportional to r^4. So the number of stars increases as r^4 with distance.

Looking at the options: option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.

The question states that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely related to distance (\(r\)) in parsecs (\(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\)), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars increases with distance as \( r^5 \).

However, the question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\(r\)). To determine this, we consider the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \(r\) with thickness \(dr\). The number of stars in this shell is approximately \( \frac{dN}{dr} \), which is the derivative of \(N\) with respect to \(r\). Taking the derivative of \(N \propto r^5\), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \(r^4\).

Thus, the correct answer is that the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \(r^4\).
