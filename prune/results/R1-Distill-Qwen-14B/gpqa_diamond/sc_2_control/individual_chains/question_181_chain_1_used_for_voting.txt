Alright, let me try to work through this problem. Okay, so the question is about neutrino flux from the Sun, specifically comparing two energy bands after a certain reaction stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, like the proton-proton chain, and different branches within that.

So, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III branch stopped, the effects on neutrinos would be seen here on Earth after that time. But since the question is about the current flux ratio, the neutrinos we detect now would reflect the changes from that stoppage.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I think the pp chain is the main fusion process in the Sun, right? The proton-proton chain produces helium-4 from hydrogen. There are different branches, like the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. I'm not super clear on the details, but I remember that pp-III involves some boron or maybe lithium? Oh right, pp-III is the boron burning branch. So, it's a minor part of the Sun's energy production compared to the main pp-I.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, the production of which neutrinos would be affected? Neutrinos are produced in various processes. The main ones are the neutrinos from the proton-proton chain, which are the pep and the main pp (like the dominant branch) neutrinos. But wait, the pp-III branch produces a specific type of neutrino as well. Let me think—maybe the pp-III is responsible for producing some higher-energy neutrinos?

Wait, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where two protons and a helium-3 nucleus (He-3) combine to form boron-8 (B-8). Boron-8 is unstable and decays into lithium-7 and two positrons, I think. Oh, and during that decay, I believe a neutrino is emitted. Or wait, maybe more accurately, the production of B-8 is part of the pp-III branch, and the decay of B-8 produces high-energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, then those high-energy neutrinos wouldn't be produced anymore.

So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are higher energy compared to the main pp branch. The main pp branch (like the dominant pp-I) produces lower-energy neutrinos. But how does this affect the flux in the two energy bands?

The question is about the ratio of flux in two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, let's think about what neutrino energies are produced where.

If the main pp branch (pp-I) produces lower-energy neutrinos, maybe around 200-800 keV, and the pp-III branch produces higher-energy ones, like above 800 keV or so. So when pp-III stops, the flux in higher bands would drop more.

So before the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from both branches were contributing to the flux. After stopping, only the main pp branch continues. Therefore, the neutrinos in the higher energy bands (like 800-900 keV) would rely mostly on pp-III, which is now gone. So, their flux would decrease significantly compared to the lower band.

Wait, but band 1 is 700-800 keV and band 2 is 800-900. So band 1 is lower and band 2 is higher. If pp-III contributes more to the higher energies, then when it stops, band 2's flux would drop much more than band 1. So the ratio F1/F2 would be higher than before, because F2 is lower.

But how much higher?

Let me think about the relative contributions. Suppose that the main pp branch (pp-I) contributes a certain amount to both bands, and pp-III mainly contributes to band 2.

Assume that prior to stopping, the flux in band 2 was mostly from pp-III, while band 1 was a mix of main pp and maybe some pp-III. After stopping, band 2 would lose all its pp-III contribution, but band 1 would lose only a small part, if any.

So maybe band 1 flux is primarily from the main pp branch, and band 2 is mainly from pp-III. Therefore, after stopping, band 1 flux remains about the same, and band 2 drops to near zero (since pp-III was the main contributor there). So the ratio would be roughly F1/F2 ≈ previous F1/(F2 without pp-III). 

But wait, the question says "what is the approximate ratio". So if in the absence of pp-III, the flux in band 2 drops to almost zero, then the ratio would be very large. But looking at the options, option A is 10, option B is 0.01, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp branch contributes to both bands, but with different intensities. Let's consider that the main pp branch produces a broad spectrum of neutrinos, some in band 1 and some in band 2. The pp-III contributes mainly to band 2. So when pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 is reduced, but it's not entirely gone because the main pp still contributes some. So, the ratio would be (flux1)/(flux2) = (main_pp_band1) / (main_pp_band2 + ppIII_band2).

But I'm not sure about the exact fractions. Let me think about the typical energy distributions. The main pp chain produces neutrinos with energies around 200-800 keV, and the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe above 800 keV. So if band 2 is 800-900 keV, which is in the range where pp-III is dominant, and band 1 is 700-800, which is the upper end of main pp.

So before stopping, band 2 would have a significant contribution from pp-III. Let's say that the main pp contributes, say, 10% of band 2's flux, and pp-III contributes 90%. So when pp-III stops, band 2's flux drops to 10% of its original. Meanwhile, band 1's flux is mainly from main pp, which hasn't changed, let's say main pp contributes 90% to band 1 and maybe 10% comes from pp-III (if any). Wait, but if pp-III doesn't contribute to band 1, which is 700-800, then band 1 is still at full strength.

So if band 1 was at X and band 2 was Y before, after stopping pp-III, band 2 is Y' = Y * 0.1 (assuming main pp contributes 10% to band 2), and band 1 is still X.

So the ratio would be X/(0.1 Y) = 10 * (X/Y). What was the ratio before? Before, X/Y would be (main_pp_band1) / (main_pp_band2 + ppIII_band2). Since main_pp contributes more to band 1 than band 2.

Wait, main pp produces a distribution that peaks at lower energies, but some do go into higher bands. So, for band 1 (700-800), main pp contributes more, say 90% of its total in that band. For band 2 (800-900), main pp contributes maybe 10% of its total, and pp-III contributes 90%.

So before stopping, band1: 90% from main pp.

Band2: 10% from main pp, 90% from pp-III.

After stopping, band2: only 10% remains (from main pp).

So, the flux ratio F1/F2 after stopping would be:

F1 = 90 (main pp), F2 = 10 (main pp), so ratio is 9.

Wait, but the options don't have 9. Hmm. Closest options are A)10 and D)0.1.

Wait, no, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me think again.

Wait, in reality, the main pp branch contributes to all bands, but the highest energy neutrinos from main pp might be around 800 keV. So, for band 1, which is 700-800, main pp contributes most of it, say 90%, and pp-III contributes a small part, say 10% (so 700-800 could have a little from pp-III as well). For band 2 (800-900), maybe main pp contributes 5% and pp-III contributes 95%. Because pp-III emits higher energy neutrinos.

So before stopping, band1: 90% main, 10% pp-III.

Band2: 5% main, 95% pp-III.

After stopping, band2 becomes 5% (from main pp), and band1 remains 90% main + 10% pp-III (since pp-III stopped, so the 10% from pp-III in band1 would drop to zero? Or wait, no. Because pp-III might not contribute to band1. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe pp-III's neutrinos are higher than 800 keV. So they don't contribute to band1 (700-800), only to band2. So band1 only has main pp, and band2 has main pp and pp-III.

So before stopping: F1 is all from main pp (100%), F2 is 80% from main pp and 20% from pp-III (as an example). The actual percentages would depend on the exact energy distributions.

Wait, but that's probably not correct. Because the main pp branch produces a range of neutrino energies. The main pp branch has a peak in the 200-800 keV range. So, within that, the main pp contributes to both bands. So if band1 is 700-800, let's say that the main pp produces 90% of that. Band2 is 800-900, and main pp produces, say, 10% of that, and pp-III produces 90%.

So before, F1 = 90 (main pp), F2 = 10 (main) + 90 (pp-III) = 100.

After stopping pp-III, F2 becomes 10.

So the ratio F1/F2 becomes 90 / 10 = 9.

But the options don't have 9. The closest is A)10.

But maybe I'm being too precise. The question is about an approximate ratio. So if the flux in band2 was mainly from pp-III, then after stopping, band2's flux would drop a lot, making the ratio F1/F2 much larger than 1.

If the original ratio was about 1 (since both bands receive contributions from main pp and pp-III), then after stopping, band2 loses most of its flux. So the new ratio would be (F1 main pp) / (F2 which is mainly from main pp's higher end).

Wait, perhaps prior to stopping, F1 was (main pp + some pp-III), and F2 was (main pp + most pp-III). So F1 was say (80 + 20) = 100, and F2 was (10 + 90)=100, ratio is 1. After stopping, F1 remains 80 (since pp-III stopped contributing there?), and F2 is 10. So ratio becomes 80/10=8.

Again, close to 10 or 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp contributes more to band1. For example, main pp neutrinos peak around 300 keV, but have a tail up to 800. Let's say that band1 (700-800) has 10% of main pp flux, and band2 (800-900) has 5% of main pp. Then, if pp-III contributed 95% of band2, then after stopping, band2's flux drops by 95%, leaving 5% from main pp.

So F1 is 10 (main pp) + whatever from pp-III. But if pp-III doesn't contribute to F1, then F1 remains at 10, F2 was 95 (pp-III) +5 (main pp) =100. After stopping, F2 is 5, so ratio is 10/5=2.

But none of the options is 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes a small fraction to the total neutrino flux. I recall that the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the main pp-I. So, the pp-III contributes maybe 1-2% of the total neutrino flux. So, in band2, which is 800-900 keV, if pp-III was the main contributor, then perhaps the flux in band2 is higher than band1.

Wait, but without exact numbers, it's hard to get precise. Maybe another approach: in the Sun, the main neutrino emission is from the dominant proton-proton chain (pp-I), which produces 7Be and then captures a proton to make 8B, which then decays into 7Li + positron + neutrino. Wait, wait, perhaps the main neutrinos are the ones from the pep branch (pep) and the main pp branch. Oh, wait, the main pp neutrinos are from the branch where a proton captures a 7Be nucleus (but I think that's the main pp-I), and the pep branch is a different part.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The dominant proton-proton chain is the pp-I branch, which is the majority of the solar neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are minor branches.

The pp-III branch is the boron burning branch. So, when the pp-III stops, the production of B-8 stops. B-8 decays into 7Li and emits a neutrino. So, the neutrinos from the decay of B-8 are high-energy, around 15-18 MeV? Or wait, no, neutrinos are emitted with a range of energies, but the B-8 decay emits a neutrino with an average energy of about 4 MeV. Wait, no, that can't be—wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the proton-proton chain's dominant branch and the pep branch. The dominant pp branch (pp-I) produces neutrinos when a 7Be nucleus captures a proton to form 8B, which then decays into 7Li, emitting a neutrino. The energy of this neutrino is around 3.7 MeV on average, but the distribution extends to higher energies. The pep branch is a small part of the pp chain that produces higher-energy neutrinos (around 14-18 MeV), but it's a minor contribution.

The pp-III branch, which is the boron burning branch, involves reactions that produce B-8. B-8 decays into 7Be and emits a neutrino, but wait, that's the same as the main branch? Or perhaps I'm mixing up the steps. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch contributes to the production of higher-energy neutrinos, such as those around 14-18 MeV, similar to the pep branch.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to look for another approach. The question is about the ratio F1/F2, where F1 is 700-800 keV and F2 is 800-900 keV. So, the neutrinos in F2 are higher energy than those in F1.

If the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, then when it stops, the higher-energy flux (F2) would drop more than the lower-energy flux (F1). So, F1 remains largely unaffected, but F2 drops. Thus, the ratio F1/F2 would increase.

If before the pp-III stopped, F1 and F2 were roughly similar (because both had contributions from main pp and maybe a bit from pp-III), then after stopping, F2 would be much lower. For example, if pp-III contributed 90% to F2 and 10% to F1, after stopping, F2 becomes 10% of its original, while F1 remains at 100%. So the ratio would be 100% / 10% = 10.

But wait, in reality, pp-III's contribution to F1 (700-800) might be negligible. Because pp-III's neutrinos are higher than 800 keV. So, F1 is almost entirely from the main pp branch, and F2 is a mix of main pp and pp-III.

So, if the main pp branch contributes x% to F2, and pp-III contributes (100-x)% to F2, then after stopping pp-III, F2 = x% of original.

So, the ratio F1/F2 after stopping would be (F1) / (x% * F2_original).

But without knowing x, it's tricky. However, if pp-III is a major contributor to F2, say 90%, then F2 after stopping would be 10% of original. So F1/F2 ratio becomes F1/(0.1 F2_original) = 10*(F1/F2_original).

What was the original ratio? If F1_original = F1 (all from main pp), and F2_original = main_pp_contribution_to_F2 + ppIII_contribution_to_F2.

Assuming that main pp contributes, say, 20% to F2, and 80% comes from pp-III. So F2_original is 100, and F1_original is 100.

After stopping, F2 becomes 20. So F1/F2 = 100/20 =5. Still, not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the main pp branch's contribution to F2 is much smaller. Let's say main pp contributes 5% to F2, and pp-III contributes 95%. So F2_original is 100, F1_original is 100.

After stopping, F2 is 5. Ratio is 100/5=20. But the options don't have 20. Alternatively, perhaps the main pp contributes 10% to F2, so after stopping, F2 is 10, and ratio is 10.

Wait, that gives us a ratio of 10, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp contributes about 10% to F2, and pp-III contributes 90%. So before stopping, F1 is 100 (all from main pp), F2 is 100 (10% from main pp, 90% from pp-III). So the ratio was 1. After stopping, F2 drops to 10 (only main pp's contribution), so F1/F2 is 100/10=10. So the ratio becomes 10.

That would make option A correct.

But wait, another thought. The main pp neutrino distribution is such that the majority of the neutrinos are around 3-4 MeV (3000-4000 keV). So, the 700-800 keV band is much lower than the main peak. So, perhaps the main pp contributes a small amount to band1 and a small amount to band2.

But when pp-III is stopped, which produces higher-energy neutrinos, then band2's flux would drop more.

If, for example, band1 has 10% from main pp and 90% from pp-III, and band2 has 5% from main pp and 95% from pp-III, then after stopping, band1 is 10% and band2 is 5%.

So the ratio F1/F2 is 10/5=2. But that's not one of the options.

But perhaps I'm getting the contributions wrong. Another approach: if the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in the higher energy range, and the main pp in the lower, then when pp-III stops, the higher band's flux would drop.

So band1 (700-800) is dominated by main pp, and band2 (800-900) is dominated by pp-III. So originally, F1 is mainly from main pp, F2 from pp-III.

When pp-III stops, F2 drops, so F1/F2 increases. If F2 was 90% of pp-III and F1 was 10% from main pp, but that can't be right because F1 would be much higher.

Wait, perhaps the main pp produces a large number of neutrinos, but the majority are in lower energy bands. So, for band1, which is around 700-800, maybe 90% comes from main pp and 10% from pp-III. For band2, 800-900, maybe 5% from main pp and 95% from pp-III.

So before stopping, F1 is 90 (main) + 10 (pp-III) = 100, F2 is 5 +95=100. Ratio is 1.

After stopping, F1 is 90 (main) only, F2 is 5 (main) only. So ratio is 90/5=18.

Hmm, but option A is 10. Close but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps pp-III contributes more to F2 than I thought. Let's say F2 is 90% from pp-III and 10% from main pp. So after stopping, F2 is 10% of its original.

So F1 is say 90 (main pp), F2 is 10 (main pp). So ratio is 9.

But the options don't have 9. So, perhaps the intended answer is 10, so option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos have a peak around 600 keV, so the 700-800 band is the tail, so main pp contributes maybe 50% to F1, and 50% from pp-III. F2 is 90% from pp-III, 10% from main pp.

So, after stopping, F1 is 50, F2 is 10. Ratio 50/10=5.

But again, not matching the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp contributes a small fraction to both bands, but pp-III contributes a major fraction to band2. So, F1 is 90% main pp, 10% pp-III. F2 is 5% main pp, 95% pp-III.

After stopping, F2 is 5% (main pp), so F1 is 90, F2 is 5. 90/5=18.

But again, not matching the options.

Perhaps the correct approach is to think about the fact that the pp-III branch is a minor contributor. So, the flux from pp-III is small compared to main pp. So, when it stops, the flux in band2 reduces a little, making the ratio F1/F2 not change much, so approximately 1. So, the answer would be C) 1.

But that doesn't seem right because the question states that the pp-III stopped, which would have a significant effect on higher energy bands.

Wait, perhaps the main pp neutrinos have a continuous spectrum, with a tail into higher energies. So, band1 (700-800) is mostly main pp, and band2 is a mix of main pp and pp-III.

If the pp-III contribution is significant to band2, then when it stops, band2 flux reduces. Let's say originally, F1 was 100 (all main pp), F2 was 10 (main pp) +90 (pp-III) = 100. So ratio F1/F2 was 1.

After stopping, F2 becomes 10, so ratio is 100/10=10. So option A is 10.

That makes sense. So the answer would be A)10.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor to solar neutrino production, primarily producing high-energy neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range. The main proton-proton (pp-I) branch produces a broad spectrum of neutrinos, with contributions extending into both bands but peaking at lower energies.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Contributions**:
   - **Band 1 (700-800 keV)**: Primarily contributed to by the main pp-I branch. The pp-III branch contributes negligibly to this band, as its neutrinos are generally higher energy.
   - **Band 2 (800-900 keV)**: A mix of contributions from the main pp-I branch (lower energy tail) and the pp-III branch (major contributor, especially at higher energies).

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - The pp-III branch is a significant source of neutrinos in band 2. When it stops, the flux in band 2 drops significantly, leaving only the contribution from the main pp-I branch.
   - Band 1 remains largely unaffected, as it is dominated by the main pp-I branch.

3. **Flux Ratio Before and After**:
   - **Before Stopping**: Band 1 flux is dominated by the main pp-I branch, while band 2 flux includes contributions from both the main pp-I and pp-III branches. The ratio \( F_1 / F_2 \) is approximately 1.
   - **After Stopping**: Band 2 flux drops to only the contribution from the main pp-I branch, while band 1 flux remains unchanged. This increases the ratio \( F_1 / F_2 \).

4. **Approximation**:
   - If the pp-III branch contributes 90% of the flux in band 2, and the main pp-I branch contributes 10% to band 2 and 100% to band 1, the ratio after stopping becomes:
     \[
     \frac{F_1}{F_2} = \frac{100}{10} = 10.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The approximate ratio of the flux between the two bands after the pp-III branch stops is **10**.
