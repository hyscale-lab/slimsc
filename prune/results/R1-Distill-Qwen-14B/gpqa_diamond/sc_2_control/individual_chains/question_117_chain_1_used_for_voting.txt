Okay, so I have this question about isomers and optical activity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. The question is asking which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. 

First, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, I need to check each compound to see if they have any such centers.

Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings... So the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. At positions 2 and 2', there are carbonyl groups, and at 6 and 6', nitro groups. And the ester groups are on the same positions. But wait, the question is about optical isomerism. So, does this structure have a chiral center? Well, the central carbon where the two phenyl groups are attached—wait, no, the biphenyl is connected via a single bond, so each carbon on the biphenyl is part of the ring and maybe doesn't have four different substituents. Alternatively, are there any chiral centers in the ester groups? Each ester group is CH3-O-CO-... so the oxygen is connected to the methyl and the carbonyl. So the central carbon in the ester is attached to OMe, O, and two carbonyl groups? Wait, no. Wait, the ester group is O-CO-O, but wait, no, the formula is dimethyl, so each ester is OMe. Wait, the structure is 2,2'-dicarboxylate, so each COO- is connected to a methyl group. So each of those would be OMe on the carbonyl. So the carbonyl is connected to an oxygen (from the ester linkage), a methyl (from the ester), and two phenyl groups? Wait, perhaps not. Wait, the structure is the biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2', which are COOCH3 groups. So each COOCH3 is attached to the benzene ring. Now, considering the central carbon in each ester group: the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The oxygen in the ester is attached to the methyl and the carbonyl. But the central carbon in the biphenyl—each phenyl ring is connected by a single bond, so the bond between the two rings is a single bond. So each ring can rotate, but I don't think the central carbon is a chiral center. Wait, but in the case of biphenyls, sometimes there's a possibility of atropisomerism if the rotation is hindered. But for that, the substituents have to be bulky enough to prevent free rotation. Are the substituents here (like nitro groups) in positions that would cause the rings to be non-superimposable? Let me think. The substituents are at 6 and 6'—so perhaps on the same side or opposite. Wait, but if the rings are connected by a single bond and can rotate, then the substituents may be able to rotate into positions that make the molecule superimposable. But if the substituents are in such a way that the rings can't rotate (like if they are bulky and hinder rotation), then it's a case of atropisomerism. But I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so no chiral centers. Alternatively, perhaps each substituent is in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical. I'm a bit confused. Maybe it's better to move on and come back if needed.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with methyl ester, so the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3CHOHCOOH, and the ester would be when the -OH of the acid is esterified. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the chiral center is the middle carbon (the one attached to OH). Let's see: the groups attached are CH3, OH, COOCH3, and a hydrogen. So four different groups? Yes. So this compound has a chiral center, and thus can exist as enantiomers, showing optical isomerism. So compound 2 does.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is two benzene rings connected by a ketone group, so it's Ar-CO-Ar. The central carbon is connected to two benzene rings and a carbonyl group. So the groups are two benzene rings (which are identical?), a carbonyl (O double bond), and a hydrogen. Wait, no, the structure is Ph-C(O)-Ph. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, one carbonyl (O double bond), and a single hydrogen. So the groups are Ph, Ph, O (as part of C=O), and H. Wait, so two substituents are the same (two phenyl groups). So the central carbon has two identical groups, making it not a chiral center. So benzophenone doesn't have a chiral center. But wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism? No, that's for double bonds, so I think in this case, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers because the central carbon has two identical substituents. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, so the structure is CH2CH(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's succinic acid. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with a double bond between the two CH groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So the diester would replace the two -OH groups with OMe. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-(COOCH3), but wait, no, the double bond is between the two carbons. So it's more like (COOCH3)CHCH(COOCH3). Wait, so the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait. Fumarate is the trans form of the diacid. So the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. Oh wait, no, wait. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. So, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, because that would be succinate. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, that's succinic acid. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH for succinic, and HOOC-CH=CH-COOH for fumaric. So the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the two ester groups are on each end of the double bond. Now, the question is whether this structure has any chiral centers. The central two carbons are double-bonded, so each is connected to two carbonyl groups (the esters). So each of those carbons is attached to COOCH3, another COOCH3, and two CH2 groups? Wait, no. Wait, each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, because the structure is CH2-COOCH3 on both ends. Wait, no, the structure is CH2(COOCH3) connected by a double bond. So each central carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs? No, because the structure is CH2(COOCH3) on each end. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. No, wait, the formula is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, that's succinate. Fumarate has a double bond. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 and OCH3-O-C=O on each end of a double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is more like:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

No, perhaps a better way: the molecule is (E)-but-2-enedioic acid dimethyl ester. So structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? Wait, no, because but-2-ene would be CH2-CH2. Hmm, maybe I should draw it. The structure of fumarate is the trans diastereomer. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, so about chiral centers. Let's look at each carbon in the molecule. The COOCH3 groups are on the ends of the double bond. So each of the central carbons is part of the double bond and therefore is sp² hybridized. For a carbon to be chiral, it must be sp³ and have four different substituents. So the central carbons are double-bonded and thus not chiral centers. The other carbons are the ones attached to the ester groups. Let's see: each ester group is CH3-O-CO-O- attached to the double bond. Wait, no, each ester is OMe attached to the carbonyl. So each COOCH3 is attached to a CH2 group (from the butenedioate). Wait, perhaps it's better to think about whether any of the carbons in the molecule have four different substituents. 

Looking at the central carbon: each is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups? No, because in the structure, the central carbons are part of the double bond. The carbons next to the double bond (the ones attached to COOCH3) would each have two substituents. So, for example, the structure might be CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3 if it were succinate, but for fumarate, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3? Wait, no, fumarate's structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH(COOCH3). No, wait, that can't be right because that would imply branching. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3, which can't be right because that's a single bond. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: does the molecule have any chiral centers? For that, any carbon with four different groups. The dimethyl fumarate structure: the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond. The central two carbons are double-bonded, so each has two substituents. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a CH2 group and a COOCH3. Wait, so the carbon adjacent to the double bond could be CH2. Let me imagine the structure. Let's say it's CH2(COOCH3) on either end of a double bond. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, and for fumarate, you have CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that would imply a four-carbon chain. Oh, wait, but fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH-COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group? No, that doesn't fit. Let me think again. The molecule is (E)-butenedioic acid dimethyl ester. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3
   |
   O

No, wait, but that's for a single bond. For a double bond, it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    CH2-CH2
   /
O-C-OCH3
But wait, that's not correct. I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of a double bond. So the structure would look like O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-O-C-OCH3, but that's for a single bond, which would be succinate. For fumarate, it's O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-O-C-OCH3. So the carbons in the double bond are each connected to a COOCH3 and a CH group. Wait, no, each of the two carbons in the double bond would have a COOCH3 on one side and a CH2 or CH group on the other. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but that would have four carbons in a row with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3.

Wait, regardless of the exact structure, the key point is whether any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Since dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, the carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The other carbons are attached to the ester groups. Let's look at the carbons adjacent to the double bond. Each of those carbons is attached to a CH2 group and a COOCH3. So, the groups would be CH2, COOCH3, and two Hs? If that's the case, then the carbon has two Hs, a CH2, and a COOCH3. That's three different groups plus the Hs. No, wait, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, then the CH2 would be connected to a COOCH3, a CH=CH group, and two Hs. So, the groups are H, H, CH(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), and COOCH3. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each of those carbons is connected to a COOCH3, a CH2, and two Hs. That would make it CH2(COOCH3)CH2. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a COOCH3, a CH2, and two Hs. So, for example, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, but for fumarate, it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, but then the CH2 groups are on either side of the double bond, and the double bond is between the two central carbons.

In that case, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a COOCH3, a CH2, and two Hs. So, for each of these carbons, the substituents would be: COOCH3, CH2 (which is connected to another CH2 and a double bond), and two Hs. So, four substituents: H, H, CH2, COOCH3. So no, because two substituents are the same (H and H). So no chiral centers there.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Is there any other carbon in the structure that could have four different substituents? The ester groups are OCH3 attached to the carbonyl, so the carbons in the ester are connected to O, the carbonyl, the methyl, and another group. Wait, the carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The methyl groups are all attached to O, so each OCH3 is connected to three identical groups (three CH3s and an O). So, no chiral centers here either.

But wait, what about the possibility of geometric isomerism (cis-trans) in the double bond? That relates to the arrangement around the double bond, but that's not the same as optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of the diacid, but does it have chiral centers? I don't think so. So perhaps compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe in the molecule, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but that doesn't create a chiral center. So I'm starting to think that compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center either.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another possibility: the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. If the structure is symmetric, then it can't have a chiral center. For example, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical. Then, there are no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, to recap:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: Are there any chiral centers here? The biphenyl rings are connected by a single bond. If the substituents are symmetric, then no. Let's imagine the structure: the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each has nitro groups at 6 and 6', and ester groups at 2 and 2'. So, each ring has a nitro group and an ester group. If the arrangement is such that the substituents are in symmetrical positions, then the molecule as a whole might be symmetrical. For example, if the nitro groups are in positions that mirror each other across the central axis, then the molecule might not have a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the central biphenyl bond allows the molecule to have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, perhaps this molecule is symmetrical and thus does not have a chiral center. So, compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about the possibility of atropisomerism? Atropisomerism occurs when a molecule has hindered rotation around a single bond, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. For biphenyl compounds, if the substituents are bulky enough, the molecule can have atropisomers. So in this case, the substituents are nitro groups and ester groups, which are bulky. So perhaps the biphenyl can't rotate freely, leading to distinct isomers. But wait, atropisomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, but does it lead to optical isomerism? Because atropisomers are enantiomers if they're mirror images. So if the molecule is not symmetrical, it can have atropisomers, which are enantiomers and thus exhibit optical activity. So, does this compound have such a structure?

Looking at the substituents: each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester group. Let's imagine the positions: if the nitro groups are on the same side (both para to the connecting bond), and the ester groups are also on the same side, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Or maybe not. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could have atropisomers, which are optical isomers.

Wait, but for a biphenyl compound to have atropisomers, the substituents should be in such a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Let's say the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetric. For example, if one ring has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester at 2, and the other ring has similar substituents, but arranged in a way that breaks symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule chiral.

But without a clear understanding of the exact structure, it's a bit tricky. But I'll assume that compound 1 lacks a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism because of symmetry.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: No optical isomerism.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

Wait, but wait. What about compound 4 again? I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, so the two ester groups are on opposite sides. So, the molecule is trans. Now, the question is whether any carbon in this molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at the structure, the two carbons in the double bond are each connected to two substituents: one ester group and one CH2 group. So, for each of these carbons, the substituents are:

- For the left carbon in the double bond: attached to a CH2 group (which is connected to another CH2 and a COOCH3), a COOCH3 group, and two Hs? Or perhaps, considering the double bond, each carbon is double-bonded to another, so each has only three substituents: the double bond, a COOCH3 group, and a CH2 group. So, each of these carbons has three substituents, making them trigonal, not tetrahedral. So, not chiral centers.

The other carbons are the CH2 groups. Let's look at the carbon attached to the COOCH3 and the double bond. So, for each CH2 group, the substituents are: two Hs, a COOCH3, and a CH (from the double bond). So, the groups are H, H, COOCH3, and CH. So, since two substituents are H, this carbon isn't a chiral center. So, no chiral centers in compound 4. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Wait, but earlier I thought that compound 4 might not have any, but I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: are there any other chiral centers I'm missing? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, based on this, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, the options given are:

A) 1, 2, and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, but according to my analysis, only compound 2 does. So none of the options match, because none of the options say only 2. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 1. Let me re-examine.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Structure: biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2' positions (COOCH3) and at 6 and 6' (NO2).

The biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are in such a way that each ring has a COOCH3 at 2 and a NO2 at 6. So, the arrangement on each ring is such that the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Now, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or exhibits atropisomerism.

Atropisomerism occurs when the single bond between the two rings is sufficiently hindered so that the molecule can exist in forms that are non-superimposable. For example, if the substituents on the rings are large and prevent rotation, the molecule can have atropisomers—thus being chiral.

In this case, the substituents are nitro groups and ester groups, which are relatively bulky. So, perhaps the rotation around the single bond is hindered, leading to atropisomerism. If that's the case, then the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism because the two atropisomers are enantiomers.

But wait, for atropisomerism to occur, the molecule must not have a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a symmetric fashion, then the molecule would be achiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are mirror images, then the molecule might be symmetrical.

In this compound, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. Looking at the positions on the biphenyl, 2 and 6 are para to each other on each ring. So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. Now, the biphenyl can rotate, but if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule as a whole is chiral, then atropisomerism occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. If the substituents on each ring are placed symmetrically, the entire molecule could be achiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, then no chirality. 

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach is to think about whether the molecule is meso or not. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's meso and thus not chiral. But again, without the exact structure, it's hard to say.

But considering that the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring, and the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure: if the two rings are connected such that the substituents on each ring are mirrored, then the molecule would be symmetrical and thus not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates chirality, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about another angle: if the biphenyl has substituents that are not symmetrical, then the molecule could be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral. So, for example, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that one is a mirror image of the other, the molecule would be symmetrical.

But if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then the molecule would be chiral.

Without the exact structure, it's challenging, but perhaps the positions 2 and 6 on each ring are such that the substituents are in a symmetrical arrangement, making the molecule achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not symmetrical. Let's say the two rings have substituents that are opposite each other, but the overall structure is not symmetrical. For example, if the two rings are connected in a way that creates a chiral center, but that seems unlikely since the central bond is a single bond.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates chirality. For example, if the two rings have substituents that are not mirror images, leading to a lack of symmetry. So, the molecule could be chiral and exhibit optical isomerism.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make a decision.

So, to recap:

Compound 1: Possibly exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism. Not certain.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

Looking at the options, option A includes 1, 2, 4. Option D includes 1 and 2.

But according to my analysis, only 2 has optical isomerism. But that's not an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3?

Wait, no. The correct structure is CH2(COOCH3) on each end, connected by a double bond. So, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would imply four carbons with a double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is (E)-MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, that's the succinate. Fumarate is (E)-MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So, the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, each end is a COOCH3 group. So, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, and MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 for fumarate.

Wait, no. For fumarate, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. So each of the two middle carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group. So, each central carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two Hs (because of the double bond). So, each central carbon has groups: COOCH3, COOCH3, and two Hs. So, each has two identical groups (COOCH3 and COOCH3), so no chiral centers.

But wait, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the double bond are CH2 groups. For example, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate, and MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 can't be right because that's a single bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 for succinate and MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 for fumarate. In that case, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a MeOOC group, a CH2 group, and two Hs. So, each of these carbons has substituents: MeOOC, CH2, H, H. So two Hs, which means no chiral centers.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, no chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. But looking back at the options, none of them have only 2. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

So, if only 2 is correct, but none of the options have only 2, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the compounds. Alternatively, perhaps compound 4 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think again. Could the molecule have a chiral center I didn't notice?

Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3. The two central carbons are part of the double bond. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are each connected to a MeOOC and a CH2 group. So, each of those carbons is attached to MeOOC, CH2, H, and H. So, substituents: MeOOC, CH2, H, H. So, two Hs. So, no.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is arranged in a way that creates a chiral center elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If it's symmetric, then no chiral centers. 

Wait, another angle: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that bisects the two COOCH3 groups. For example, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides, the molecule might be symmetrical. So, no chirality.

Thus, I think compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Then, the only compound that does is number 2. But the options don't include that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a COOCH3 at position 2. Now, considering the biphenyl structure: the two rings are connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other on each ring.

Now, the question is whether the molecule as a whole is chiral. If the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule asymmetrical, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and COOCH3 at 2. On each ring, 2 and 6 are across from each other. So, when looking at the biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are opposite each other. Now, if the two rings have substituents arranged in a way that the entire molecule is symmetrical, then it's not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that their arrangement relative to the central bond is not symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the two rings have substituents that are mirror images. If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center at the central bond.

Wait, the central bond is a single bond. So, if the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it could be chiral, leading to atropisomerism.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. But I think that in this case, the molecule is symmetrical. Because each ring has the same substituents at equivalent positions. So, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, only compound 2 does. But none of the options have only 2. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center after all. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which has a trans configuration. Let me imagine the structure:

MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOCH3 (succinate, no double bond)

MeOOC-CH=CH-COOCH3 (fumarate, double bond)

The central two carbons are double-bonded, so each is attached to two groups. The carbons adjacent to the double bond (the CH2 groups) would each have substituents.

Wait, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a COOCH3, a CH2, and two Hs. So, substituents: H, H, CH2, COOCH3. So, no chiral centers.

But wait, perhaps the structure is different. What if the diester is on adjacent carbons? Wait, perhaps the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH(COOCH3)=CH2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to another O=C-OCH3. Wait, that's for a single bond, which would be succinate.

For fumarate, it's O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH2 group, connected by a double bond to another CH2 group, which is attached to O=C-OCH3. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH group, which is double-bonded to another CH group, which is attached to O=C-OCH3. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH=CH-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but that can't be correct because the double bond is between two CH groups, each attached to an ester.

In that case, each of those CH groups is attached to O=C-OCH3 and another CH (from the double bond). So, each has substituents: O=C-OCH3, CH (from double bond), and two Hs. So, substituents: O=C-OCH3, H, H, CH. So, two Hs, making it not a chiral center.

Thus, I'm confident that compound 4 doesn't have a chiral center. So, only compound 2 does, which isn't an option. So, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, perhaps compound 1 does have a chiral center. Let's think again about the structure. The biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine looking along the central bond. The substituents on each ring are in positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. Now, in the biphenyl, the substituents on each ring could be arranged in such a way that their positions relative to each other create chirality.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is such that substituents on each ring are in positions that make the entire molecule chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry. 

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, given that the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, and the rings are connected at 1 and 1', perhaps the molecule is symmetric along the central bond. If the substituents on each ring are mirror images of each other, the molecule would be achiral.

But perhaps the substituents are placed such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to chirality. For example, if the substituents on each ring are not mirror images, the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers but has atropisomers, which are enantiomeric. So, in that case, the molecule would exhibit optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.

So, in this case, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. 

If that's the case, then compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, which corresponds to option D.

But earlier I thought that compound 1 might not exhibit optical isomerism. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis.

Given the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not certain.

Wait, but earlier I concluded that compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers. So, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which includes compounds 1 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find the correct answer.

Wait, another approach: which of these compounds are capable of having enantiomers?

Compound 2: Yes, because it has a chiral center.

Compound 1: If it has a chiral center or exhibits atropisomerism, then yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So, if compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism, then the correct option would be A or D. If only compound 2, then none of the options, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 1. Let me think: if the molecule has a chiral center, then it would exhibit optical isomerism.

But in the case of the biphenyl, the central bond is a single bond, so the two rings can rotate. So, unless there's a chiral center on one of the rings, it's unlikely to have optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on the rings are such that each ring has a chiral center.

Looking at the substituents on each ring: each has a nitro group and an ester group. Are any of the carbons on the rings chiral? For example, in the substituents, perhaps the ester group is attached to a carbon that's a chiral center.

Wait, no. The ester group is COOCH3, which is attached to the benzene ring. The benzene ring is attached to the CH2 group (from the COOCH3), but that's part of the aromatic system. So, the carbons in the ring are sp² hybridized and not chiral centers. Thus, no chiral centers in the rings.

Thus, compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 does. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the central carbon in the ester groups is a chiral center. Wait, no, the ester group is OMe attached to the carbonyl. So, the carbon in the ester is connected to O, COOCH3, and two CH3 groups. So, no, because the substituents would be O, COOCH3, and two CH3s, but wait, that's not correct. The ester group is OMe, so the structure is OMe connected to the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O. So, the carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center.

So, in conclusion, only compound 2 has a chiral center, thus exhibits optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread them. Let me check:

Options:

A) 1, 2, 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

So, if compound 2 is the only one with optical isomerism, but the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the central carbons are double-bonded, so each is attached to two substituents. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, and two Hs. So, no chiral centers.

Thus, no. So, I'm back to the original conclusion. Only compound 2 has a chiral center.

But the options don't include that. So perhaps the answer is option A, but I don't see how. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about geometric isomerism (cis-trans), not optical isomerism. But the question specifically mentions optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-CH2(COOCH3)CH=CH(COOCH3). So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, looking at the carbons adjacent to the double bond: each has a COOCH3, a CH2, and two Hs. So, substituents are COOCH3, CH2, H, H. So, no chiral centers.

Thus, compound 4 doesn't have any.

So, the only compound with optical isomerism is 2. But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I must have made a mistake in evaluating compound 1.

Wait, another angle: the question is about which of the following moieties show optical isomerism. So, which compounds have any possibility of having optical isomers?

Compound 2 definitely does.

Compound 1: perhaps it does.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So, if compounds 1 and 2 do, the answer is D. But without being sure about compound 1, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Thus, I'll go with option D: 1 and 2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or atropisomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to chiral centers or hindered rotation (atropisomerism).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and ester groups at positions 2 and 2' on each ring. The biphenyl structure can exhibit atropisomerism if the bulky substituents (nitro and ester groups) prevent free rotation around the central bond. If the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule can lack a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism. Thus, this compound likely exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. The carbon atom at the 2-position (the one attached to the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two benzene rings are connected by a ketone group. The central carbon is bonded to two identical benzene rings, a carbonyl group, and a hydrogen. Since it does not have four different substituents, it lacks a chiral center and does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans (E) ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. The central carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and cannot be chiral centers. The carbons adjacent to the double bond are each bonded to a COOCH3 group, a CH2 group, and two hydrogens. Since these carbons do not have four different substituents, they are not chiral centers. Therefore, this compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 likely exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.  

The correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**.
