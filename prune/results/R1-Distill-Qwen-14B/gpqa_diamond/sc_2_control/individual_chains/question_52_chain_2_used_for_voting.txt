Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

First, I'll try to parse the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—no, no, wait. Oh, no, the Teff when there are spots is 5500 K. Or wait, is the Teff the photospheric temperature? Wait, the problem says when the surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So that's the new Teff. So the star's overall brightness changes because parts of its surface are cooler (spots), making the average Teff lower.

But wait, wait a second. Oh, wait, no. Because when a star has spots, those spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the total flux emitted by the star decreases, but the effective temperature is an average based on the total luminosity. So the problem says that the Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered. So the star's overall Teff is lower than when there are no spots.

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes, i.e., (N1/N2) without spots divided by (N1/N2) with spots.

Wait, the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor would be (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower, so the factor is greater than 1.

Wait, but how does the temperature affect this ratio? I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio N1/N2 depends on temperature as (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels, and E2 is the energy of the upper level, E1 the lower.

Wait, wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), because E2 is higher than E1. So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -(ΔE)/(kT) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So when the temperature increases, the exponential term increases, because the denominator kT is larger. So the ratio N1/N2 increases with higher Teff, assuming ΔE is positive (E2 > E1). Wait, no, because higher T makes the exponent less negative. So if E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive, so the exponent is negative. So as T increases, the exponential term becomes larger because the denominator is bigger, but the negative sign makes it approach zero slower. So the ratio N1/N2 would be proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), multiplied by the statistical weights.

Oh wait, but in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower. So Teff drops from 6000 K to 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star's average Teff is lower. But how does this affect the photosphere? Assuming that the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K.

Wait a minute, I'm a bit confused. Because when a star has spots, the overall luminosity is lower, so the effective temperature is lower. But the photosphere's temperature is not uniform. So when the star has spots, the average Teff is 5500 K, but the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spotted regions are lower. But in this problem, when the star isn't spotted, the entire surface is at 6000 K.

Wait, but the problem states that when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. So perhaps when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So when spots are present, the photosphere has a lower average temperature.

But wait, in reality, the star's surface is a mix of hotter and cooler regions when spots are present. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K, so the average is lower.

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So in LTE, each region may have its own temperature, but perhaps the problem is modeling the observed ratio as if the entire photosphere is at the average Teff. Hmm, but the problem says, "In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio...". Oh, perhaps the entire photosphere is assumed to be at the effective temperature. Or wait, perhaps the transition is observed in the integrated light, so the ratio is a weighted average. Hmm, but the problem says, "the photosphere is in LTE," so each part is in LTE.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. So when spots are present, 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature, and 60% is at 6000 K. So the Ti atoms in different regions would have different energy level populations. But when you observe the total spectrum, the lines would be a blend of the two regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Because the problem says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps it's treating the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

But that doesn't make sense physically because the spots are cooler regions. So perhaps the problem is making an approximation, but let's read it again.

The problem states: "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the effective temperature is 5500 K, which is the average. But in reality, the photosphere isn't uniform. However, the question is about the ratio in the photosphere, so perhaps each region has its own temperature, but the observed ratio is an average.

But wait, the problem says "in the stellar photosphere," when examining the ratio. So I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about it differently.

The key is that the ratio N1/N2 is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). Since the problem gives the wavelength of the transition as approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or maybe extreme UV? Wait, 1448 Å is about 0.1448 nm, which is in the UV range. But perhaps that's not directly relevant except for estimating the energy of the transition. Because E = hc/λ.

But wait, perhaps I can compute the energy difference ΔE. Let me calculate that. So using the formula E = hc/λ. Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1448e-10 m) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

But I need this in terms of energy levels, so per atom. Then, the Boltzmann constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) would be (1.372e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.372 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approximately 9.94e4 K.

Wait, 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.372 / 1.38) * (1e-18 / 1e-23) ) = approx 0.994 * 1e5 = 99400 K.

So ΔE/(k) is about 99400 K. So the exponent is ΔE/(k T). So for T=6000 K, the exponent is 99400 / 6000 ≈ 16.567. And for T=5500 K, it's 99400 / 5500 ≈ 18.07.

Wait, but wait, in the Boltzmann factor, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for higher T, the exponent is less negative, meaning the ratio is higher. Because as T increases, (ΔE/(k T)) decreases, so the exponent is less negative, so exp(-x) becomes larger.

Wait, let me think again. The ratio N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So when T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, so the exponential increases. So N1/N2 increases with T.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower (because Teff is 5500 K), the exponent is more negative, making the exponential term smaller. So N1/N2 is lower when T is lower.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K) and the ratio N1/N2 decreases. So comparing when the star has no spots (6000 K) and when it does (5500 K), the ratio is higher in the no-spot case because T is higher. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

So let's compute the ratio of the two ratios.

Let me denote R as the ratio N1/N2. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But since g1/g2 is the same in both cases (same star, same transition), the ratio R1/R2 (where R1 is no spots, R2 is with spots) is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) )

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, wait: R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (-ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, because ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, that would be the same as ΔE/(k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. So T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

ΔE/(k) is approximately 99400 K, as computed before.

So the exponent becomes 99400 * ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) )

Let me compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667.

Their difference is 0.000181818 - 0.000166667 = 0.000015151.

So 99400 * 0.000015151 ≈ 99400 * 1.5151e-5.

So 99400 * 1.5151e-5 = (99400 * 1.5151) * 1e-5.

Calculating 99400 *1.5151:

99400 * 1 = 99400

99400 *0.5 = 49700 → 49,700

99400 *0.0151 ≈ 99400 * 0.01 = 994; 99400 *0.0051≈506.94 → total ≈ 1500.94.

Adding up: 99400 +49700 = 149100; 149100 + 1500.94 ≈ 150600.94.

Multiply by 1e-5 → 150600.94 *1e-5 ≈ 15.060094.

So the exponent is approximately 15.06.

So R1/R2 = exp(15.06) ≈ ?

Hmm, what's exp(15)? Let me remember: exp(10)≈22026, exp(15)=exp(10)*exp(5)=22026 * 148.413≈3.269e6.

Wait, but 15.06 is slightly more than 15. Let me compute exp(15.06) = exp(15) * exp(0.06).

exp(0.06) is approximately 1.0618.

So 3.269e6 * 1.0618 ≈ about 3.47e6.

Wait, but this can't be right. Because when the spots are present, the ratio R2 is lower, so the factor R1/R2 would be much larger than 1, but the options are nowhere near that. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, this suggests I made a mistake in my approach. Because according to this calculation, the factor is around 3.5e6, which isn't any of the options. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔE/(k). Let me recalculate that.

The wavelength is 1448 Å = 1448e-10 meters.

E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) ) = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = let me compute that. 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) ) * 1e-25+7 = 1.9878 /1.448 ≈ 1.373 → 1.373e-18 J.

Then, ΔE/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 → approximately 0.995 * 1e5 = approx 99500 K.

So that's correct. So the exponent when calculating R1/R2 is 99500 * (1/5500 -1/6000 ) ?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Because when calculating the exponent in R1/R2, I have (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, T1 is 6000 K (no spots), T2 is 5500 K (with spots).

So 1/T2 is bigger than 1/T1. So the difference is positive. So the exponent is positive, so R1/R2 = exp(positive number), which is a large number. But the options don't have a number that high.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood how the ratio changes. Let me think again. The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_with_spots = R2 < R1.

So R1/R2 is greater than 1. So the factor is the ratio when no spots are present divided by when spots are present, which is (R1)/(R2) = (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

But according to my calculation, this is exp(15.06) ≈ 3.47e6, which is way higher than any option.

So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I got the energy levels reversed. Because if level 1 is lower than level 2, then E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. But perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, so the energy difference is negative. Wait, no, the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, which would mean that the photons are emitted when the atom drops from level 2 to level 1. So the energy of the photon is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So I think my initial approach is correct. So why is the factor so high?

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the entire photosphere being at 5500 K. Because when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, perhaps the rest is at 6000 K. But then the observed line would be a blend of the two regions. So the observed ratio would be a weighted average based on the area covered.

Wait, but the problem states: "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K." So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present, but that doesn't make physical sense. Because spots are cooler regions, the rest should still be at 6000 K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the effective temperature as the representative temperature of the entire photosphere when spots are present. But that would imply that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, which isn't correct. So perhaps the problem is oversimplifying, and we're supposed to model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K when spots are present.

But if that's the case, then my initial calculation stands, which leads to a factor of ~3.5e6, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in some other aspect.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the inverse ratio. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which implies that R2 < R1. So the factor is R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me re-calculate the exponent.

Wait, (1/T2 - 1/T1) is (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000 ) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) ≈ 1.51515e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) ≈ 99500 K → 99500 * 1.51515e-5 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505 ≈ 4.5.

Because e^1 ≈ 2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817.

So approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the factor is about 4.5. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation of (1/T2 - 1/T1) * (ΔE/k).

Ah! I see where I went wrong earlier. I thought (1/T2 - 1/T1) was about 0.000015151, but when multiplied by 99500, it's 99500 * 0.000015151 = ?

Wait, 1e5 * 1e-5 is 1. So 99500 is about 99.5e3, and 0.000015151 is 1.5151e-5.

So 99.5e3 * 1.5151e-5 = 99.5 * 1.5151e-2 ≈ 99.5 * 0.015151 ≈ approximately 1.507.

So the exponent is approximately 1.507. So exp(1.507) is e^1.507 ≈ 4.51.

So the factor is about 4.5, which matches option C.

So the ratio N1/N2 increases when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does, by a factor of ~4.5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights of the levels, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Parameters:
1. **Energy difference (\(\Delta E\))**: The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(1448 \, \text{Å}\). Using the relation \(E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to energy per unit temperature (\(\Delta E / k\)), where \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K}.
   \]

2. **Temperatures**:
   - \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (no spots),
   - \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (with spots).

3. **Ratio of Ratios**:
   The ratio of the populations without spots to with spots is:
   \[
   \frac{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{N_1}{N_2}\right)_{\text{with spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) \approx 99,500 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.505.
   \]
   \[
   \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes (no spots to with spots) is approximately **4.5**.
