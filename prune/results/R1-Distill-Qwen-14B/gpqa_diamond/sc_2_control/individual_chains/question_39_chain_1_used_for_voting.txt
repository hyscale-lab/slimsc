Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that moves along a tube—the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit odd. Because in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex number, but the form here is interesting. Oh wait, I think I remember that the wave function must be square-integrable and must satisfy certain normalization conditions.

The question states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region x=1 to x=3. So, the wave function must be zero (or undefined) outside this region. But the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that can't be right because if it's a valid wave function, it must be normalizable. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the expression. Let me read it again. Oh, maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by e^(-0.5i something), but no, the given expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That seems a bit strange because wave functions usually have a complex exponential part, perhaps. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo in the problem, but I'll proceed as given.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by another term, perhaps an exponential. But maybe the problem is written correctly, and the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But that doesn't look like a standard form. Or perhaps the 'i' is part of an exponential term, like e^(-i something). Oh, maybe it's (a/(sqrt(1+x))) multiplied by e^(-0.5i something), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is simply (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by a complex number, perhaps like e^{-ikx} or something else. Hmm. But the way it's written is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, which looks like a subtraction. That might be a problem because then the wave function could be complex, but its real and imaginary parts would need to be considered.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach the problem. The wave function is given, and when we measure the position, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So, the wave function must be zero outside this region. So, perhaps the given wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Wait, but the expression given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, maybe this expression is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero otherwise. Hmm, but the problem says that this is the wave function in the region where it can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So, perhaps the wave function is non-zero only in that region, and zero elsewhere. But that's not what the expression says. Wait, maybe the wave function can be written as a function that's (a/sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by e^{-i something}, but for this problem, I'm supposed to find 'a' such that the wave function is normalized.

Wait, the wave function needs to be normalized, which means the integral of the absolute square (the probability density) over all space must equal 1. So, we can set up an integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx equals 1.

Wait, but let's look at the given wave function again. It's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex number. Let me compute its modulus squared. The modulus squared is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) ]² + [ (-0.5) ]², because the real part is a/sqrt(1+x) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So, |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that's interesting. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Integrate this from x=1 to x=3. But that can't be right because if that's the case, then the integral would be a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to 3. Let's compute each part.

Compute the integral ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that part would contribute a² * ln(2).

The other part is 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. That's 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5. And this must equal 1 for normalization.

So, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate that numerically. Let's see: ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202. So a² is approximately 0.7202. Therefore, a is sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8487.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close to 0.8487. So the answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So, when I compute the modulus squared, it's [real part]^2 + [imaginary part]^2. Real part is a/sqrt(1+x), imaginary part is -0.5. So, |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. That seems correct.

So integrating from 1 to 3:

Integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25 * (2) = 0.5.

So adding them gives a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² = (1 - 0.5)/ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7202) ≈ 0.8487. Rounding to two decimal places, that's approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Hmm, but wait a moment. Are we sure that the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3? Because the way the problem is stated, when measuring, no particles were found outside that region. So perhaps the wave function is zero (or not considered) outside this interval. But the way the wave function is written, (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, that's valid for x where 1+x is positive, so x > -1. But the problem says that particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere. But in the given expression, it's non-zero elsewhere as well. Hmm, but that might not matter for normalization because the integral outside 1 to 3 would contribute zero. Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside 1 to 3, then the integral would be only over 1 to 3, which is what we have already considered.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the wave function is given as valid in the part of space where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So, outside that region, the wave function is zero. Therefore, the expression (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere. So when integrating, we're only considering from 1 to 3, which is what we did.

Thus, our calculation should be correct. So, the value of 'a' is approximately 0.8487, so option B is 0.85, which is the closest.

To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) equals 1. This means:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Thus, the normalization integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

We split this into two parts:

1. \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx \)
2. \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx \)

For the first integral, the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \):

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

For the second integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Rearranging for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7202 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7202} \approx 0.8487
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( a \approx 0.85 \). Comparing this to the options, the closest value is:

**Answer: B**
