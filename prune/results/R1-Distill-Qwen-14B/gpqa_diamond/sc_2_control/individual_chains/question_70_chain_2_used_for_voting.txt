Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the reactions given step by step. 

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. That's a lot of B reacting with A. I'm thinking about the possible reactions here. Maybe A is a metal, since it's a solid, and B is a diatomic gas. Common diatomic gases are like O2, N2, Cl2, etc. Wait, but when A reacts with B in a ratio of 8, that might suggest something like a metal reacting with Cl2, but 8 equivalents are a lot. Maybe A is aluminum, which reacts with Cl2? Or perhaps it's another metal. Alternatively, maybe B is something like O2, but that would form oxides, but I'm not sure about the 8:1 ratio.

Wait, another thought: what if A is a metal that forms a salt with B? For example, suppose B is Cl2. Then A could be a metal that forms a chloride. But 8 equivalents of Cl2—that's a big amount. Alternatively, maybe B is a halogen, and A is a metal that forms a halide with multiple charges.

Wait, the product C is bright red. Bright red products in chemistry often make me think of things like MnO2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a transition metal complex. Another bright red substance I remember is mercury(II) nitrate, but that's more orange, I think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrate or sulfate? Hmm.

Let me think about the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So E is dangerous. Possible options for E could be something like phosgene (but that's COCl2), or maybe a strong acid, but with D being another gas.

Wait, the third reaction is C reacting with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives two acids. Strong acid and weak acid. Hmm.

Examples of such reactions: perhaps C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two acids. Like, for example, if C is a nitride, it might produce ammonia and another acid. But ammonia is a weak base, so maybe not. Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. No, sulfides usually produce HS- and maybe another acid. Or perhaps C is a nitrate? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride or a cyanide. Wait, but let's think about the products. Water reacting with C gives A and two acids. So, if A is a metal, then maybe the reaction produces the metal hydroxide and two acids. But wait, if A is a metal, then maybe in the first reaction, A and B form a metal chloride (C). Then when that chloride reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into the metal hydroxide and HCl. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so F could be HCl. But then, where does the weak acid come from? Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider possible substances for C. If C is a metal oxide, like Al2O3, which is a bright white solid, so that's not red. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong and weak acid. So, for example, if C is NaHSO4, which is a salt that can hydrolyze into H2SO4 (strong acid) and NaOH (but that would produce a base, not an acid). Alternatively, perhaps C is something like (NH4)2SO4, which when dissolved in water gives NH4+ and SO4^2-, but the hydrolysis would produce NH4OH (which is weak, like NH3·H2O) and H2SO4. Wait, that's a possibility.

Wait, but (NH4)2SO4 is white, not bright red. Hmm. Or maybe another sulfate. Alternatively, if C is a nitrate, like Ca(NO3)2, but when it dissolves in water, it just dissociates into ions without hydrolysis. Not producing acids, I think.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfite. For example, CaSO3. When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into Ca(OH)2 and H2SO3. Hmm, H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, a weak acid. But if F is a strong acid, then where does that come from? Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate of a metal that hydrolyzes into a strong acid and another acid.

Wait, maybe I'm getting off track. Let's think about the other reactions. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B are gases, and their reaction produces H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like hydrochloric acid, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, perhaps H is a solvent like ether, but that's more of a liquid. Wait, another possibility: if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, then their reaction would be Cl2 + H2O → 2HClO (but wait, that's more like Cl2 + 2 H2O → HClO + HCl + H2O? Or perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, if D is something like NH3, which can react with Cl2 to form NH2Cl. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. Then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That's possible. If B is O2 and D is H2, then 1:1 ratio? Wait, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1 for H2:O2. But the problem states D and B react in a 1:1 ratio. So if B is O2, D would have to be something that reacts 1:1 with O2. Hmm. Maybe D is F2, so O2 + F2 → 2 FOO or something? Not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about D and B. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So for example, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, but their reaction isn't 1:1. Alternatively, if B is NH3 (a gas) and D is something else. Hmm, maybe D is CO2 and B is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O2, then 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. But the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So maybe that's not it. Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is O3 (ozone), then H2 + O3 → H2O + O2. But that's probably not a 1:1 reaction.

Wait, perhaps H is something like CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. So if D is CO2 and B is something else, but I don't see the reaction.

Alternatively, think of H as DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), but I'm not sure how that would form from B and D.

Wait, perhaps D is SO2 and B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S and D is Cl2. Then H2S + Cl2 → 2 HCl + S↓. But that's a possible reaction, but the product isn't a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, moving on. Let's think about the product E. When C reacts with gas D in a 2:1 ratio, it produces E. E is extremely hazardous. What could E be? Maybe phosgene? Phosgene is COCl2, but I'm not sure how that fits. Or perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but I don't think it's formed from C and D as described.

Alternatively, maybe E is a strong acid like H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like Cl2O7 (dichlorine heptoxide) which is a strong acid, but I don't know if that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps C is a nitride. For example, NH4NO3 is a nitride that could hydrolyze. Wait, NH4NO3 when heated can decompose, but when reacted with water, it might produce HNO2 and HNO3. Oh! Wait, that's interesting. Let's think about that.

If C is ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), which is a white crystalline solid. When it reacts with water, it would give NH4OH (which is weak, but actually it's NH3·H2O) and HNO3, which is a strong acid. Hmm, but in the problem statement, C reacts with water to form A plus two acids F and G. So A would be NH3 in this case. But then A would be a gas, but in the first reaction, A is a solid. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a dichloride or something else.

Wait, perhaps C is something like CaC2. When CaC2 reacts with water, it produces C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. But that doesn't produce acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce acetylene and calcium hydroxide. But again, no acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt of a strong base and weak acid, like NaHSO4. When NaHSO4 reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^- ions. But HSO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to form SO4^2- and H+.

Wait, but let's think about the hydrolysis. If C is NaHSO4, then when it dissolves in water, it would give Na+ and HSO4^- ions. HSO4^- can act as an acid (donating H+) or a base (accepting H+). So, if HSO4^- donates a proton, it becomes SO4^2- and H+. So in solution, you have H+ (from HSO4^-) and SO4^2-.

But in that case, the reaction with water would produce H+ (a strong acid) and SO4^2- (which is the conjugate base of a strong acid, so not an acid itself). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate of a metal that hydrolyzes. For example, consider Pb(NO3)2. When Pb(NO3)2 reacts with water, it hydrolyzes into Pb(OH)2 and HNO3. So the products would be a strong acid (HNO3) and a weak acid? Wait, Pb(OH)2 is more of a base. So maybe F is HNO3, and G is something else. Hmm, but the problem says two different acids, F and G, so both should be acids.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to map each reaction step by step.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)
Second reaction: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
Third reaction: C + H2O → A + F + G (F is strong acid, G is weak)
Fourth reaction: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

Let me try to figure out possible substances for each.

Looking at the fourth reaction: B and D react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So possible pairs could be H2 and O2 (but their ratio is 2:1 for H2O), so no. Maybe CO2 and H2O? No, that's not 1:1. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is H2O, then Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. But that's a 1:1:1:1 reaction, but the ratio is 1:1 for B:D. So total products would be HCl and HOCl, which are both liquids or solutions. Hmm, but the product H is a solvent, so maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: B is NH3 (a gas) and D is HCl (a gas). Then NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl (a solid). But that's a 1:1 ratio, but the product is a solid, not a solvent. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, B is H2O (liquid, but the question says gas B and D) and D is something else. Wait, maybe B is H2O (but it's a gas?), but that's not a gas under standard conditions. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2, but they react in a 2:1 ratio, not 1:1.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2O. Then, O2 and H2O can form HOOH (but that's not a common reaction). Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is Cl2. Then Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. So H would be a mixture of HCl and HOCl, but that's not a pure solvent. Alternatively, perhaps the main product is HCl, which is a liquid, but that's not a solvent in itself.

Wait, another angle: what solvents are formed from reactions of gases? Perhaps H is something like ethanol or methanol, but how would that form from B and D?

Wait, if B is CO2 and D is H2O, then they can form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's a weak acid and not a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is NH3. Then CO2 + NH3 + H2O → NH4HCO3, which is a solution but not a typical solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is H2S and D is Cl2. They react in 1:1 ratio to form 2 HCl + S↓. But that's not a solvent.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let's think about E. E is the product of C reacting with D in 2:1 ratio. E is extremely hazardous. What about phosgene (O=CCl2)? Phosgene is a toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2O (chlorine dioxide), which is a dangerous gas.

But how would that form? If C is something like CCl2O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is CCl2F2? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red). One possibility is that A is aluminum and B is Cl2. 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. But that's a 3:2 ratio of B to A. The problem states 8 equivalents of B, so perhaps the reaction uses more Cl2. Wait, but 8 equivalents would imply 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. For aluminum, which has a valence of +3, the formula would be AlCl3. So for 1 mole of Al, you need 3 moles of Cl2. So 8 moles of Cl2 would suggest maybe a different formula. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe, and B is Cl2. Fe reacts with Cl2 in a 3:2 ratio (for FeCl3). But again, not matching 8 equivalents.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal that forms a higher chloro compound. Maybe it's a +4 oxidation state. For example, SnCl4. So, Sn (solid) + Cl2 (gas) → SnCl4. The reaction would require 2 moles of Cl2 per mole of Sn. But 8 moles would suggest a different stoichiometry. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces a polymer or something else. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms a complex with B. Hmm.

Another thought: maybe C is a bright red salt. For example, potassium permanganate (KMnO4) is purple, but not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitro compound. For example, sodium nitrate is white. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. But sulfides are usually not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chromate or dichromate. Sodium dichromate is orange. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitroprusside or something else. I'm not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a complex ion. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me try to think about E. If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent or a highly toxic gas. Alternatively, maybe it's something like sarin gas, but that's more of an organophosphate. Alternatively, maybe E is something like hydrogen cyanide (HCN), but I don't see how that forms from C and D.

Wait, if C is a chloride salt and D is a gas like SO2, then maybe C reacts with SO2 to form something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is NH4NO3. Then, when it reacts with SO2 (D), maybe something happens. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate, like KClO3. When it reacts with D, which could be SO2 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider the symmetry group first. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

What are these symmetry groups?

C2 is a two-fold rotation. It's a minimal symmetry group.

D4h is the dihedral group with four-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. It includes elements like 4-fold rotation, reflections, etc. This is the symmetry of a square or something with four-fold symmetry and horizontal mirrors.

D∞h is the dihedral group with infinite-fold rotation, which is the symmetry of a regular polygon with infinite sides, like a straight line or a cylinder. It has a horizontal mirror and infinite vertical mirrors.

C2v has a two-fold rotation and two vertical mirror planes. It's the symmetry of a water molecule, for example.

Wait, the question is about E's molecular symmetry. So I need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular symmetry.

But to determine E's structure, I need to understand the reactions.

Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red)
Second: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
Third: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Fourth: B + D → H (solvent, 1:1)

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate, and when it reacts with H2O, it produces a metal hydroxide and a nitric acid. Then F would be HNO3, which is a strong acid, and G would be another acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, if C is a nitrate salt, like NaNO3, then when it's hydrolyzed in water, it would just dissociate into Na+ and NO3^- ions. NO3^- is the conjugate base of a strong acid (HNO3), so in water it doesn't hydrolyze further. So that might not produce two acids.

Hmm, perhaps C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. When FeS reacts with water, it doesn't usually hydrolyze. But if it's a more complex sulfide, perhaps like CuS, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the production of two different acids upon hydrolysis. So, if C is a salt of a weak acid and a weak base, like NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into H2CO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But that doesn't fit because F and G are acids, not a base.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a diacid salt. For example, Na2HPO4. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NaOH and H3PO4. So F would be H3PO4 (strong acid?), but H3PO4 is a weak acid. Alternatively, if it's something else.

Wait, perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids. For example, perhaps a salt like Mg(HSO4)2. When it hydrolyzes, it might produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and Mg(OH)SO4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metaborate or something similar. Hmm.

Another angle: let's think about the possible reaction of C and D to form E.

If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a highly reactive compound. For example, ozone (O3) is a dangerous gas, but how does that form from C and D?

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like Cl2O or something else.

Wait, another possibility: E could be phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a toxic gas. So, if C is a chloride, and D is CO2, then perhaps C reacts with CO2 to form phosgene. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, phosgene is made by reacting CO with Cl2 in presence of a catalyst, but that's maybe not fitting here.

Hmm, perhaps E is a highly oxidizing compound. Maybe ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is a strong oxidizing agent and toxic. How would that form?

ClO2 can be formed via the reaction of NaClO3 with HCl (concentrated) under heat. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps D is O2, and C is something that when reacts with O2 forms a strong oxidizer.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible groups.

The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

Which of these are common for certain molecules?

- D4h is the symmetry of molecules like ozone (O3) and some transition metal complexes.
- D∞h is the symmetry of linear molecules like CO2, H2O (in gaseous form, but it's bent), O3, and others. Wait, no, O3 has D3h symmetry, I think. Wait, O3 has a bent structure with a central oxygen, so it's C2v symmetry.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible structures of E.

If E is O3, its symmetry is D3h. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. For example, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry, but when it's a gas, it's a linear molecule. Wait, but CO2 is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry in the gas phase. So if E is CO2, its symmetry group is D∞h. But is CO2 extremely hazardous? Probably not, but maybe in certain contexts.

Alternatively, phosgene (O=CCl2) has a trigonal planar structure. The molecule is planar with a central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the symmetry group would be C2v. Because there's a mirror plane along the C-O axis and a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to that. So C2v is the symmetry group.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2O, which has a bent structure similar to O3, its symmetry group would be C2v.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures of E again.

If E is O3 (ozone), which is a bent molecule with a central oxygen atom. The molecule has a C2v symmetry group. Ozone has a central O with two O atoms attached, making a bent structure. So yes, it's C2v symmetry.

But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Ozone is indeed toxic in high concentrations, so that could fit.

Alternatively, phosgene is also extremely toxic. Phosgene is O=CCl2, which is a planar molecule. The molecule has a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. The symmetry here would involve a mirror plane through the C=O bond and a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to it. So that's C2v symmetry as well.

Wait, if E is phosgene, then its symmetry group is C2v, which is option D.

If E is ozone, same C2v symmetry.

So either way, if E is a planar molecule with a mirror plane and a two-fold rotation, it would be C2v.

But wait, let's think about the reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E.

If C is a chloro compound and D is CO2, for example, then maybe C is something like Cl2C=O (phosgene) isn't formed from C and CO2. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride, and D is something else.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about possible H from reaction of B and D. H is a solvent formed from B and D in 1:1 ratio. Suppose H is water (H2O), which is a solvent. Then, B and D would have to react to form H2O. For example, B could be H2 and D could be O2. But the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So the ratio is 2:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if H is something like ethanol, but how would that form from B and D?

Alternatively, perhaps B is NH3 and D is HCl. NH3 + HCl → NH4Cl, which is a solid, not a solvent. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps B is H2O and D is something else. But H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is something else. For example, O2 and H2S. O2 + 2 H2S → 2 H2O + 2 S. But that forms a solid, not a solvent.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is H2O. Cl2 + H2O → HCl + HOCl. So H is a mixture, but if the main product is HCl, which is a liquid, not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O (but that's a liquid) and D is something else. I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps B is NH3 and D is H2O. But that's a liquid, but in the reaction, it's a gas. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2O and D is NH3, but both are gases at high temps. Then, H2O + NH3 → NH4OH (which is a liquid, not a solvent).

Alternatively, perhaps H is something like H2O, but formed from B and D. But I'm stuck.

Let me go back to the first reaction. If A is a metal and B is Cl2, then C is a chloride. The reaction uses 8 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of A. What metal would require 8 moles of Cl2 per mole? Let's see.

The formula for the chloride would be AClx. The moles of Cl2 needed would be x/2 per mole of A (since each Cl2 provides 2 Cl atoms). So if x is 8, then moles of Cl2 would be 8/2 =4 per mole of A. But the question says 8 equivalents of B (Cl2). So perhaps 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A.

So, x/2 =8 → x=16.

Wait, that's a lot of Cl per A. What metal forms a 16-valent chloride? That's unlikely. Maybe the formula is different, like ACl4. Then x=4, so moles of Cl2 per mole A is 4/2=2. So if 8 equivalents are used, that wouldn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is 2 A + 8 B → 2 C. Then, for each mole of A, 4 moles of B are used.

So, if B is Cl2, then 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. So for A as Al, which has a +3 charge, the formula would be AlCl3. Moles of Cl2 per mole Al: 3/2. So 1.5 moles Cl2 per mole Al. Not matching 4.

Hmm, perhaps A is a transition metal with a higher charge. Let's say A is Fe with a +8 charge. Then the formula would be FeCl8. So moles of Cl2 needed per mole Fe would be 8/2=4. So 4 moles Cl2 per mole Fe. But the reaction uses 8 equivalents of Cl2 per mole A. So 4 is less than 8. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ACl8, which would require 8/2=4 moles Cl2 per mole A. Still not matching 8 equivalents.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the hydrolysis reaction. C reacts with water to give A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). 

So, if C is a salt, say, MB, which upon hydrolysis gives M(OH) and HB (a strong acid) and perhaps another acid. Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, if C is NaHSO4, which is a salt of H2SO4 (strong acid) and HSO4^- (weak acid). When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Na+ and HSO4^-. HSO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to form SO4^2- and H+ (from water autoionization). So the products would be H+ (from HSO4^-) and SO4^2-. But those are ions, not separate acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt like Mg(ND)2 or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a complex salt. For example, something like Cu(NO3)2·H2O. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Cu^2+ and NO3^- ions. But nitrate is a strong acid's conjugate base, so it doesn't hydrolyze into an acid. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps C is a diacid anhydride. For example, something like (HOOC)2O (oxalic anhydride), which upon hydrolysis gives HOOC-COOH (oxalic acid). But that's one acid, not two.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride. For example, something like HSO4·HCO3. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfite, like CuSO3. When it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into Cu(OH)2 and H2SO3. H2SO3 is sulfurous acid, a weak acid. So F would be H2SO3 (weak acid) but where's the strong acid? Hmm, unless the metal hydroxide is a strong base, but that's not an acid.

Hmm, not matching. Maybe C is a sulfite of a metal that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid. Doesn't seem likely.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound. Like, for example, sodium nitrite (NaNO2). When it reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into HNO2 and NaOH. HNO2 is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. But the problem states that two acids are formed, so this wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metaborate or something else. I'm not making progress.

Let me think about the possible symmetry group again. If E is O3, its symmetry is C2v. If E is phosgene, also C2v. So either way, the symmetry group would be C2v, which is option D.

Wait, but the question says E is produced when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D. If E is O3, what would C and D be?

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN. The structure of HCN is linear, with a carbon atom triple-bonded to N and single-bonded to H. The symmetry group is D∞h because it's linear. But HCN is a weak acid, not extremely hazardous in small amounts, but it is toxic. But I'm not sure if it's the correct fit.

Wait, another possibility: if E is Cl2O, which is a bent molecule. Its structure is similar to O3, with a central Cl double-bonded to O and single-bonded to another Cl. So the molecule is bent, making its symmetry C2v.

So Cl2O has C2v symmetry.

But how would Cl2O form from C and D?

If C is ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is ClO^- and D is Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I think I'm going around in circles. Let's try to make some educated guesses.

Based on the hydrolysis reaction, when C reacts with water, it produces A (solid), F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a salt that upon hydrolysis releases two acids. For instance, something like HSO4^- and another acid. But I'm not exactly sure.

In any case, given the options for the symmetry group, and considering that E is likely a bent molecule with C2v symmetry, I'll go with that.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on the given reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **First Reaction**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The large amount of B suggests a highly reactive gas like Cl₂, and A could be a metal or its oxide. The bright red color of C suggests it could be a chloride or a related compound.

2. **Second Reaction**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. E could be a toxic gas like phosgene (O=CCl₂) or ozone (O₃). Both are highly reactive and fit the description of E.

3. **Third Reaction**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong acid) and G (weak acid). This suggests C is a salt that hydrolyzes into acids. For example, if C is a chlorinated compound, hydrolysis could yield a strong acid like HCl and a weak acid like HOCl.

4. **Fourth Reaction**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This could involve gases like Cl₂ and H₂O reacting to form HCl and HOCl, though the exact identity of H is unclear.

5. **Symmetry Analysis**: 
   - If E is phosgene (O=CCl₂), it is a planar molecule with a central carbon double-bonded to oxygen and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. Its symmetry group is **C₂v**, as it has a two-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane.
   - If E is ozone (O₃), it is a bent molecule with a central oxygen atom. Its symmetry group is also **C₂v**, as it has a two-fold rotation axis and a mirror plane.

Given the options, both phosgene and ozone have **C₂v** symmetry, making this the correct choice for E's molecular symmetry group.
