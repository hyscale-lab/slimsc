Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. There's a small spherical cavity inside it, not at the center because the center of the cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is located at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, okay. So I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Let me think.

First, since the conductor is uncharged, initially, there's no net charge on it. But when a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, that should induce some charges on the conductor's surfaces. Wait, how does that work again?

I recall that when a conductor has a cavity and a charge is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge inside. So, the inner surface would have -q. But wait, the conductor itself was initially uncharged, so what happens to that induced charge?

Wait a second, the conductor's total charge is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because the conductor's total charge is the sum of the inner and outer surface charges. Since the conductor was neutral, inner is -q, outer must be +q.

So the conductor as a whole now behaves as if it has a charge of +q on its outer surface. Because any excess charge on a conductor resides on the outer surface.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so L > R. Because of the conductor's properties, the electric field outside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem, right? So, the electric field outside a spherical shell of charge depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center.

So in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the electric field at point P should be as if a point charge +q is at the center of the conductor. That would mean E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), right?

Wait, but wait a minute. The charge +q is inside the cavity, but the conductor's outer surface has +q. So regardless of where the inner charge is placed, as long as it's inside the cavity, the outer surface will respond. So for any point outside the conductor, the field is just due to the outer charge, which is +q.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor, but what about the position relative to the cavity? The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle is theta, so maybe that affects the calculation somehow. Or does it?

Wait, no. Because the conductor is a conductor. The charges on the outer surface distribute themselves in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. So the outer surface behaves as a point charge when outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but in the setup, the cavity is not at the center. The center of the cavity is s distance away from the conductor's center. Oh, but that's inside the conductor, right? The conductor is a sphere, so if the cavity is off-center, then the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge -q, but the outer surface will have +q. However, the outer surface is a sphere, so the charge distribution is uniform, I think. Or wait, no, because the conductor is a sphere and the outer surface is a sphere. So in that case, the outer charge is uniformly distributed, so the field outside depends only on the total charge and distance from center.

Wait, but the outer surface is a sphere, so the distribution is uniform regardless of where the cavity is located. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges on the outer surface would adjust to make the field inside zero, so the outer surface must have a uniform charge distribution. So, regardless of the position of the cavity's charge, the outer surface will have a uniform distribution of +q. So the electric field outside the conductor would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

So looking at the options, option B is this expression. Option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, why are the other options involving l and theta? Let me think again. If the conductor is a conductor, then the charges on the outer surface are uniformly distributed. So the field at point P, which is outside, only depends on the total charge and the distance from the center of the conductor. So the position of the cavity or the point inside shouldn't matter because the outer shell's distribution is uniform.

So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform, and the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity is not at the center of the conductor, as its center is separated by a distance $s$ from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, located at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity is $l$, and the angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$. 

When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge of $+q$ to maintain charge neutrality. The outer surface of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium behaves as if all its charge is concentrated at the center, due to the shell theorem. Therefore, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge of the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor.

The position of the cavity, the angle $\theta$, or the distance $l$ from $P$ to the cavity's center do not affect the electric field at $P$, as the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform and the field outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge $+q$ and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. Using Coulomb's law, the electric field at $P$ is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This matches option B. The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly involve $l$, $s$, or $\theta$, which are irrelevant for the electric field outside the conductor.

Answer: B
