Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is another 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So I should probably write that down.

Wait, S is a matrix, so let me write it out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And then A_y = c * S. So substituting c, that becomes h/(4π) multiplied by that matrix. So A_y is a 2x2 matrix with entries (0, -i c) and (i c, 0). Plugging c in, that's (0, -i*(h/(4π))) and (i*(h/(4π)), 0). So the matrix looks like:

A_y = [[0, -i h/(4π)],
        [i h/(4π), 0]]

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. And then choose which statement is correct from the options.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0. So let's set that up.

The matrix (A_y - λ I) is:

[ [ -λ , -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, what's (-i)*(i)? Let's compute that: (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (1)*(h²/(16 π² )).

So the equation becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0. So λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but h is Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes h is used as ħ here, but in the problem statement, c is h/(4π). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of ħ. Wait, let me check: ħ is h/(2π). So h is 2π ħ. So substituting, h/(4π) is (2π ħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Wait, but in the options, the options are given in terms of h and so on.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or something. No, because the eigenvalues we found are real numbers. Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. Oh, wait, the matrix A_y is a Hermitian operator? Because angular momentum components are Hermitian.

Wait, S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me check. The matrix S has elements 0, -i; i, 0. The conjugate transpose would have 0, i; -i, 0. So S is anti-Hermitian? Because S† = -S. Because the (1,2) element is i, which is the negative of the original's (2,1) element. So S is anti-Hermitian, meaning S† = -S. Then A_y is c * S, so A_y† = c * S† = c*(-S) = -c S = -A_y. So A_y is anti-Hermitian.

Wait, but that's unusual because observables are Hermitian. Oh wait, angular momentum operators are Hermitian. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says A_y = c·S, but perhaps I have to be careful with the definition of S. Another possibility is that S is actually the Pauli matrix. Let me think about the Pauli matrices. The Y Pauli matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So that's exactly the S matrix given. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. Wait, wait, is the Pauli Y matrix Hermitian?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Let me check. The Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So its conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Which is equal to the original matrix multiplied by -1: [[0, -i],[i, 0]] multiplied by -1 gives [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as the conjugate transpose. So indeed, Y is Hermitian. So S is Hermitian, so A_y is c * S. So A_y is Hermitian as well, since c is a real constant. So that's good because observables are Hermitian.

So the eigenvalues of A_y must be real. So that explains why in our earlier calculation, we found real eigenvalues (plus and minus h/(4π)).

Wait, wait, in the calculation earlier, I found the eigenvalues as ± h/(4π). But when I thought about it in terms of ħ, that's because h/(4π) is equal to (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So real numbers.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option A says that the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be because the eigenvalues are real. So option A is wrong.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't fit either, because our eigenvalues are real, and their magnitude is h/(4π) which is a real number, not 1.

Option C: The eigenfunction of A_y can also be an eigenfunction of A squared but not of Az. Well, I'm not sure about this, but I know that for angular momentum, the square of the total angular momentum is L², and the components Li commute with L². So if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's also an eigenstate of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0. So the eigenfunctions of Ay should be eigenfunctions of A² as well. But what about Az? The components don't commute with each other, so if a state is an eigenstate of Ay, it can't be an eigenstate of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which only occurs for eigenstates of all components, but that's not possible except for certain states (like spin-1/2, but even then, only for specific cases). So option C says the eigenfunction can also be that of A² but not Az. That sounds correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix. Hmm, I'm not sure. The eigenfunctions form a basis if they are complete and orthogonal. For a 2x2 matrix, there are two eigenvalues, each with their eigenvectors. So they should form a basis. So option D sounds correct as well.

Wait, but I need to think about this more carefully. Let me go back.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. Since A_y is Hermitian, the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Wait, but let me compute the eigenvectors to check.

The eigenvalues λ are h/(4π) and -h/(4π), which are ± (h/(4π)). Let me compute the eigenvectors.

For λ = h/(4π):

The matrix (A_y - λ I) is:

[ [ -h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), -h/(4π) ] ]

So to find the eigenvector, we solve (A_y - λ I) v = 0.

Take the first equation: (-h/(4π)) v1 - (i h/(4π)) v2 = 0.

Divide both sides by h/(4π): -v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1; v2] = [ -i v2; v2 ] = v2 [ -i; 1 ].

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( -i, 1 ).

Similarly, for λ = -h/(4π):

The matrix (A_y + λ I) is:

[ [ h/(4π), -i h/(4π) ],
  [ i h/(4π), h/(4π) ] ]

The first equation: (h/(4π)) v1 - (i h/(4π)) v2 = 0 → v1 = i v2.

Eigenvector is [i v2; v2 ] = v2 [i; 1].

So the eigenvectors are [ -i; 1 ] and [ i; 1 ].

Are these eigenvectors orthogonal? Let me take their dot product.

( -i * i ) + (1 * 1 ) = (-i^2) + 1 = -(-1) + 1 = 1 +1 = 2. Wait, but that's not zero. Oh wait, because they are eigenvectors, but perhaps I should normalize them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me compute the inner product properly. The vectors are [ -i; 1 ] and [i; 1 ].

So the inner product is (-i)(i) + (1)(1) = (-i^2) + 1 = -(-1) +1 = 1+1=2. Hmm, that's not zero, which suggests they are not orthogonal. But since A_y is Hermitian, its eigenvectors should be orthogonal. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, let me recompute. Wait, maybe I missed a step. Let me think about the eigenvectors again.

Wait, for λ = h/(4π), the equation is (A_y - λ I) v = 0.

The matrix is:

Row 1: [-λ, -i c ] → because A_y has (0, -i c), so A_y - λ I is [ -λ, -i c ]

Row 2: [i c, -λ ]

So for λ = c, because c is h/(4π), the matrix is:

Row 1: -c, -i c → [ -c, -i c ]

Row 2: i c, -c.

So equation 1: -c v1 - i c v2 = 0 → -v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

Equation 2: i c v1 - c v2 = 0 → i v1 - v2 = 0 → substitute v1 = -i v2 → i (-i v2) - v2 = 0 → (i*(-i)) v2 - v2 = ( (-i^2) ) v2 - v2 → (1) v2 - v2 = 0 → 0=0.

So the eigenvector is as before, [ -i v2; v2 ].

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ] multiplied by a scalar. Now, their inner product is ( -i * i ) + (1 * 1 ) = (-i^2) + 1 = 1 +1=2. So not zero. But that's impossible because Hermitian operators have orthogonal eigenvectors. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should construct the eigenvectors correctly. Let me compute the eigenvectors properly by considering the equations again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should normalize the eigenvectors, but the orthogonality arises when the eigenvectors are normalized. Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual eigenvectors and check their inner product.

Wait, let me compute the eigenvectors for λ = h/(4π):

The equations are: -v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is [v1, v2] = [-i v2, v2] = v2 * [ -i, 1 ].

Let me choose v2=1, so the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ].

Similarly, for λ = -h/(4π), the eigenvector is [ i, 1 ].

Now, the inner product is (-i)(i) + (1)(1) = (-i^2) + 1 = (1) + 1 = 2.

Hmm, that's a problem because they should be orthogonal. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the inner product again.

Wait, when computing the inner product, I should take the conjugate transpose of the first vector and multiply by the second vector.

The first eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ].

The second eigenvector is [ i, 1 ].

The conjugate transpose of the first is [ i*, 1* ] = [ i, 1 ].

Wait, no: wait, the first vector is [ -i, 1 ]. Its conjugate transpose (as a row vector) would be [ i, 1 ].

Then, multiplying by the second vector [ i, 1 ] gives:

(i)(i) + (1)(1) = i^2 +1 = (-1) +1 = 0.

Ah! So the inner product is zero. That makes sense. So my mistake earlier was considering the inner product without taking the conjugate transpose. So they are orthogonal.

So the eigenvectors are orthogonal, as expected.

Now, looking back at the options:

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az.

Well, for a spin-1/2 system, the square of the angular momentum operator would be A² = (ħ/2)^2 * (S_x² + S_y² + S_z²) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator A is the Y-component, but the square of the total angular momentum would be A_total^2 = (A_x + A_y + A_z)^2 = A_x² + A_y² + A_z² + 2(A_x A_y + A_x A_z + A_y A_z). But for a spin-1/2 system, A² is (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2), which is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) * (3) for spin 1/2, because for spin s, A² = ħ² s(s+1) I, where I is identity matrix. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 system, the square of the total angular momentum is A² = (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2 ) = ( ħ^2 ) ( ( (σ_x)/2 )² + ( (σ_y)/2 )² + ( (σ_z)/2 )² ), where σ are the Pauli matrices. So each σ_i squared is identity matrix. So A² = ( ħ² /4 ) ( I_x² + I_y^2 + I_z^2 ) = ( ħ² /4 ) ( I + I + I ) )= ( ħ² /4 ) * 3 I. So A² = (3 ħ² /4 ) I.

So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², because A² is proportional to the identity matrix. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², since A² acting on any vector gives the same eigenvalue. So option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. And they cannot be eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenfunctions form a complete basis since they are orthogonal eigenvectors of a Hermitian 2x2 matrix. So their span is the entire space, so they can serve as a basis. So option D is also correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C says that they can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So if I'm correct, C is correct.

Now, let me look at the options again.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh or ±...? No, because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Doesn't fit our eigenvalues.

Option C: Correct, as reasoned.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions. That's correct because any Hermitian matrix's eigenvectors (when distinct) form an orthonormal basis. So D is correct.

Wait a minute, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one is correct, but let's read each option.

Wait, the question says "which statement will you consider to be correct?" So only one is correct.

Which of the options is correct?

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Well, the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the space, yes, since they are orthogonal and form a basis. So D is correct.

But let's think again about option C. It says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Since A² is proportional to identity, any state is an eigenstate of A². So all eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

So both C and D seem correct, but wait, the problem gives four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Hmm, the question is which is correct during the calculation.

Let me think about each option again.

Option C: Correct because any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A² (since A² is identity), and they are not eigenstates of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

Option D: The eigenvectors are the basis functions. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

Wait, but the options don't all have to be mutually exclusive. But in this case, the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, perhaps option C is incorrect. Let me think. The statement in option C is that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Wait, but in reality, any state is an eigenstate of A² because A² acts as a multiple of the identity matrix. So for any state, A² |ψ> = (3ħ²/4) |ψ>. So yes, the eigenstates of Ay are also eigenstates of A². So the statement in option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors are two orthogonal vectors, which form a basis. So D is correct.

But I'm supposed to choose only one correct option. The original question says "which statement will you consider to be correct?"

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't fit.

Option A's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which can't be because A_y is Hermitian, so eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Options C and D seem correct. But perhaps the correct answer is C, because D is always true for any Hermitian matrix. But since the question is about which statement is correct in the context of the calculation, perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one is an option.

Wait, looking back at the question, perhaps the calculation is more involved.

Wait, the question is asking during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So during this calculation, you might find that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is option D.

But also, during the calculation, when you find the eigenvalues, you could see that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which is option C.

But perhaps the correct answer is C because when finding the eigenfunctions, you see that they are also eigenfunctions of A².

But perhaps the correct answer is D because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the operator.

Hmm, it's getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let me look for any possible mistakes in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, in the problem statement, the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. So A_y is c * S, which is Hermitian. So its eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors are orthogonal.

So the eigenvalues are ± c, which is ± h/(4π), which is ± (ħ/2) because c= h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π )= ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the options giving real eigenvalues are options A and B. Wait, no, option A talks about imaginary parts, which is wrong, option B has real parts ±1 and imaginary parts ±1/2, which is wrong.

So options C and D are the possible correct ones.

Now, for option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So yes, they are the basis functions. So option D is correct.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Well, since A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, every state is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Hmm, but the question says, which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, I must choose the correct one.

But the options are presented as A, B, C, D, with only one correct. Let me read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, correct because A² is a multiple of identity, so any state is an eigenstate of A². And because [Ay, Az] = iħ something, which isn't zero, so they don't commute, meaning a state can't be an eigenstate of both. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That is correct as well.

Wait, but perhaps both C and D are correct. But in the options, it's not possible, so perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct. 

So while solving, when you find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you might note that the eigenvectors form a basis, which is option D. And also, you might note that they are eigenfunctions of A², which is option C.

But I think I need to choose between C and D.

The question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options present them as separate.

Wait, looking back, the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Hmm, perhaps both are correct. But according to the options, only one is correct. So I must have made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the question is about 'the' eigenfunctions, whether they are the basis functions. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenfunctions form a basis. So option D is correct.

But during the calculation, you would calculate the eigenvectors, which are the basis functions of the operator, so D is correct.

But Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So perhaps both C and D are correct. But since only one option can be correct, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate each option.

Another approach: Let's think about each option.

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/4π.

No, because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is a real number.

Option C: Correct, as discussed.

Option D: Correct, because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions are two, which form a basis. So D is correct.

But perhaps also, the correct answer is C.

But I must pick one.

Wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, perhaps D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. 

The problem statement says the matrix operator is 2x2. So the eigenfunctions are two vectors, which form a basis, so D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So which statement is correct.

I think the correct answer is option C.

Wait, why? Because during the calculation, you find that the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A², which is a property you can observe. And you also find that they aren't eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But I'm a bit torn. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the possible answers.

If the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2, then looking at the options, only option C's statement about the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of A² is correct.

So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. So option C is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the correct statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues are:
     \[
     \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
     \]
   - In terms of \( \hbar \), since \( \frac{h}{4\pi} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). These are real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors corresponding to \( \lambda = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( \lambda = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \) are orthogonal. For \( \lambda = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and for \( \lambda = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvector is proportional to \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

3. **Analysis of Options:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).
   - **Option B:** Claims the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), not \( \pm 1 \).
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because:
     - \( A^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix (\( A^2 = \frac{3\hbar^2}{4} I \)), so any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \).
     - \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenstate of \( A_y \) cannot be an eigenstate of \( A_z \).
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator. This is also correct because the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, the question specifies selecting the correct statement during the calculation. Option C highlights a key property of the eigenfunctions (their relationship to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \)), making it the most relevant choice.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

**Answer: C**
