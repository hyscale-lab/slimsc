Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is relativistic, so things might be different. 

The question gives me a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. I think the potential energy here is (1/2)kx², like in the classical case. But since it's relativistic, I have to consider how velocity affects the mass or maybe the equations of motion.

Wait, relativistic mechanics... Oh right, in relativity, momentum isn't just mv anymore. The relativistic momentum is gamma times m times v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, when considering forces, Newton's law would involve the derivative of momentum, which complicates things because of the gamma factor.

Alternatively, maybe energy is easier. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)mv²_max for kinetic, which equals the potential energy at maximum displacement, (1/2)kA². So (1/2)mv²_max = (1/2)kA², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The problem is relativistic, so that can't be the answer here.

So, I need to think about relativistic energy. The total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. However, under relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma -1)mc². Hmm, but maybe the oscillator's potential is still (1/2)kx²? Or does it change?

Wait, the problem says it obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is the same as before, (1/2)kx². So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the kinetic energy is zero, and the potential is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma -1)mc². So maybe the total energy is gamma mc² plus the potential energy?

Wait, no. Because in classical mechanics, the total energy is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy should be gamma mc², right? So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right because in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let's think again. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is equal to the potential energy, which is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy should also be gamma mc² when the object is at rest (v=0, so gamma=1). Wait, no, because when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, it's not at rest—it's moving, but at that instant, its velocity is zero. So at x=A, v=0, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is just the potential energy, E = (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc² plus kinetic energy. Wait, no, that's not correct. The total energy E is gamma mc², which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify. In relativity, the total energy is E = gamma m c². At maximum displacement, the kinetic energy is zero, so gamma is 1, because v=0 at that point. So E = mc². But this can't be right because the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that's the total energy. So (1/2)kA² = mc²? That would be a problem because (1/2)kA² is much smaller than mc² for typical oscillators.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Maybe the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case isn't just E = gamma m c². Because in the non-relativistic limit, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)mv² + (1/2)kA², but relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m c². So the total energy would be (gamma) m c² = (1/2)kA² + (gamma -1) m c². So simplifying, (gamma) m c² = (1/2)kA² + gamma m c² - m c². Hmm, that would imply (1/2)kA² = - m c², which is impossible. So I must be making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy in the relativistic case isn't (1/2)kx². Because in relativity, when you have a force, the potential energy isn't necessarily the same as in the non-relativistic case. Or maybe the way the oscillator works is different. Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the force is the same as in the classical case. So the potential energy U would be the integral of F dx, which is (1/2)k x². So the U is the same.

But then, the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case isn't just (1/2)kA², because the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv². So perhaps I need to set up the energy equation correctly.

At any displacement x, the total energy E is the sum of the kinetic energy and potential energy. So,

E = K + U
E = (gamma - 1) m c² + (1/2) k x²

At maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so gamma = 1. So E = (1-1)m c² + (1/2)k A² = (1/2)k A².

But at another point, when the oscillator is at x=0 (equilibrium position), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So E = K = (gamma -1) m c².

Wait, but E must be the same in both cases. So,

At x=A: E = (1/2) k A²
At x=0: E = (gamma_max -1) m c²

So,

(1/2) k A² = (gamma_max -1) m c²

We can solve for gamma_max.

gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

But gamma_max is 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c² ), where v_max is the maximum speed.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)^2 ) = 1 + (k A² )/(2 m c² )

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root.

1 / (1 - v_max²/c² ) = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]^2

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, let's say B. So B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

1/(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = (1 + B )^2.

Multiplying both sides by denominator,

1 = (1 + B )^2 (1 - (v_max^2/c^2) )

Hmm, maybe it's easier to invert the equation.

Let's take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1/(1 + B )

Then,

1 - v_max²/c² = 1/(1 + B )^2

So,

v_max²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B )^2 
= [ (1 + B )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + B )^2
= [1 + 2B + B² - 1 ] / (1 + B )^2
= (2B + B² ) / (1 + B )^2

But B is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is probably small because k A^2 is likely much smaller than 2 m c^2. So B is small, so B² is negligible. So approx,

v_max²/c² ≈ (2B )/(1 + B )^2 ≈ 2B (1 - 2B ), using 1/(1+x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x when x is small.

But wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let me just proceed without approximation.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2B + B² ) / (1 + B )^2 ]

But B is (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), so substituting back,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2*(k A²)/(2 m c²) ) + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²)/(2 m c² ) = (k A²)/(m c² )

So numerator becomes:

(k A²/(m c² )) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]^2 = (2 m c² + k A² )² / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting together,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A²/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A² )² / (4 m² c^4 ) ]

Simplify the division:

Multiply numerator by reciprocal denominator,

= c^2 * [ (k A²/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )) * (4 m² c^4 )/( (2 m c² + k A² )² ) ]

Factor out 1/(m c² ) from the first term:

= c^2 * [ (1/(m c² )) (k A² + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m c² )) ) * (4 m² c^4 )/( (2 m c² + k A² )² ) ]

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me factor out k A²/(m c² ) from the numerator terms:

Numerator:

(k A²/(m c² )) (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2 ) )

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A²/(m c² )) ( 1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2 ) ) ) * (4 m² c^4 ) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )² )

Simplify the terms:

(k A²/(m c² )) * (4 m² c^4 ) = 4 m c² k A²

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [4 m c² k A² (1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A² )^2 )

Notice that (2 m c² + k A² ) is approximately 2 m c² when k A² << m c².

Wait, but let me proceed.

The denominator is (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = [2 m c² (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))]^2 = 4 m² c^4 (1 + ... )^2.

But perhaps expanding numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator inside the brackets:

4 m c² k A² [ 1 + (k A²)/(4 m c^2 ) ]

= 4 m c² k A² + (4 m c² k A²)(k A²)/(4 m c^2 )

= 4 m c² k A² + (k^2 A^4 )

Denominator: (2 m c² + k A² )^2 = [2 m c²]^2 + 2*2 m c^2 *k A² + (k A^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ] / [4 m² c^4 +4 m c² k A^2 +k^4 A^4 ].

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should factor out 4 m c² k A² from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: 4 m c² k A² (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c² )) 

Denominator: (2 m c² )^2 [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )]^2

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [4 m c² k A² (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c² )) ] / [4 m^2 c^4 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Simplify the 4 m c² k A² and 4 m^2 c^4:

= c^2 * [ (4 m c² k A² )/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) * (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Simplify 4 m c² k A² / 4 m² c^4 = (k A² )/( m c² )

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2)/( m c² ) * (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Factor out the (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) term.

Let me let x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

(k A^2)/(m c^2 ) = 2x.

And,

(1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) = 1 + x/2.

Denominator becomes (1 + x )^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ 2x (1 + x/2 ) ] / (1 + x )^2 

= c^2 * [ 2x (1 + x/2 ) ] / (1 + x )^2 

Let me compute numerator:

2x (1 + x/2 ) = 2x + x^2 

Denominator: (1 + x )^2 = 1 + 2x + x²

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * (2x + x² )/(1 + 2x + x² )

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe let me factor numerator and denominator.

Numerator is x (2 + x )

Denominator is (1 + x )^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [x (2 + x ) ]/(1 + x )^2 

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is a small quantity if kA² is much smaller than m c².

So, let's make a Taylor expansion for small x.

Approximate denominator as (1 + 2x + x² ) ≈ 1 + 2x.

Numerator: 2x + x² ≈ 2x.

So,

v_max² ≈ c^2 [2x ]/(1 + 2x ) ≈ 2x (1 - 2x )

≈ 2x - 4 x² 

But since x is small, x² is negligible:

≈ 2x = 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c² ) = (k A^2)/(m c² )

So,

v_max ≈ sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c² ) ) * c 

= sqrt( k A² / m ) / c * c 

= sqrt(k A² / m )

Which is the non-relativistic result. But that only holds when x is small, which is when k A² << 2 m c².

But the question is asking for the maximum speed in the relativistic case, not the non-relativistic limit. So perhaps I shouldn't make this approximation.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is sqrt( k A² / m ), which would be the non-relativistic result. But the options A, B, D involve terms with c, so perhaps they are correct in the relativistic case.

Wait, let me go back to the earlier equation:

gamma_max = 1 + (k A² )/( 2 m c² )

But gamma_max = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c² )

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c² ) = 1 + (k A² )/( 2 m c² )

Let me call (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as term y.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + y

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + y )

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + y )^2

Rearranging,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 

= [ (1 + y )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + y )^2 

= (1 + 2y + y² -1 )/(1 + y )^2 

= (2 y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 

So,

v^2 = c^2 (2 y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 

But y is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ 2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) = (k A^2)/( m c^2 )

So numerator becomes:

(k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator:

( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2 

Wait, no, let me write it as ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ numerator ] / [ ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ]

= c^2 * [ numerator * 4 m² c^4 ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Substituting numerator:

[ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 ) ] *4 m² c^4

= 4 m² c^4 (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + 4 m² c^4 (k^2 A^4 )/(4 m² c^4 )

= 4 m c² k A² + k^2 A^4

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 

So,

v^2 = c^2 (4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 +4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 )

Hmm, but I don't see a straightforward way to simplify this. Maybe factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator: 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k^2 A^4 = k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Wait, 4 m c^2 +k A^2 is 2*(2 m c^2 ) +k A^2, but perhaps it's not helpful.

Wait, wait: 4 m c^2 is (2 m c^2 ) *2.

So numerator: k A^2 (2 m c^2 * 2 +k A^2 ) = k A^2 [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = [2 m c^2 +k A^2 ]^2 

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (2 (2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 ]

= c^2 * [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / ( ... )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I can factor out (2 m c^2 +k A^2 ) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, numerator is k A^2 (2 (2 m c^2 ) +k A^2 ) = 2*(2 m c^2 ) *k A^2 +k^2 A^4 

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = [2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ]^2 

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me let u = k A^2/(2 m c^2 )

Then, u = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So, numerator: 4 m c^2 k A^2 +k^2 A^4 = k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) =k A^2 [ 4 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ]

= k A^2 *4 m c^2 (1 + u/2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 = (2 m c^2 )^2 (1 + u )^2 

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 *4 m c^2 (1 + u/2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 )^2 (1 + u )^2 )

Simplify:

[4 m c^2 ] is in numerator, denominator is [4 m^2 c^4 ].

So,

= c^2 * [ k A^2 *4 m c^2 (1 + u/2 ) ] / [4 m^2 c^4 (1 + u )^2 ]

Simplify 4 m c^2 /4 m^2 c^4 = 1/(m c^2 )

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [ k A^2 (1 + u/2 ) ] / [ m c^2 (1 + u )^2 ]

The c^2 cancels with m c^2 denominator:

= [k A^2 (1 + u/2 ) ]/( m (1 + u )^2 )

But u = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so substituting,

= [ k A^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / [ m (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ]

Hmm, not seeing a clear path. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2m ))^2 )

Wait, but the denominator inside the square root is (1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2.

Wait, that would be (1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2. Hmm, doesn't match what we have.

Option B: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that's c times sqrt(1 + [1/(1 - x ) ] ), where x is (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

So, inside the sqrt: 1 + [1/(1 -x ) ] = [ (1 -x ) +1 ]/(1 -x ) = (2 -x )/(1 -x )

So option B would be c * sqrt( (2 -x )/(1 -x ) )

But from our equation,

v_max^2 = c^2 (2 y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2, where y = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, which is different.

Option D: c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2, where y = (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] = [ (1 + y )^2 -1 ] / (1 + y )^2 

= (1 + 2y + y² -1 ) / (1 + y )^2 

= (2y + y² )/(1 + y )^2 

Which is exactly the same as v_max^2 / c^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [2y + y² ]/(1 + y )^2 

Which is the same as,

v_max = c * sqrt( [2y + y² ]/(1 + y )^2 )

= c * sqrt( (2y + y² ) ) / (1 + y )

= c * sqrt( y (2 + y )) / (1 + y )

But I don't see this matching any of the options. Wait, looking again at option D.

Option D is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 ] )

Wait, let me compute the inside of the sqrt.

1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] 

= [ (1 + y )^2 -1 ] / (1 + y )^2 

= (1 + 2y + y² - 1 ) / (1 + y )^2 

= (2y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 

So,

sqrt( [2y + y² ]/(1 + y )^2 ) = sqrt( (2y + y^2 ) ) / (1 + y )

Which is equal to sqrt( y (2 + y )) / (1 + y )

But y = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so substituting,

v_max = c * sqrt( (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * (2 + k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Which is,

c * sqrt( [ (k A^2) (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ 2 m c^2 * ( 2 m c^2 )^2 ] ) ) / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write this as,

sqrt( (2y + y² ) ) / (1 + y )

= sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

= sqrt( y ) * sqrt( (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

But I'm not sure if this is helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, 2y + y² = y (2 + y )

Denominator: (1 + y )^2.

So,

sqrt( (2y + y² )/(1 + y )^2 ) = sqrt( y (2 + y ) ) / (1 + y )

I don't see a way to simplify this further, but let me look back at the options. Looking at option D, it's expressed as sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + y )^2 ), which is exactly what we have for v_max²/c².

Wait, no. Wait, option D is sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] )

Which is sqrt( (2y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 )

Which is the same as sqrt( (2y + y^2 ) ) / (1 + y )

Which is the same as v_max / c.

So, option D says v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + y )^2 ] )

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2y + y^2 )/(1 + y )^2 )

Which is exactly what v_max is. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which becomes,

c * sqrt( [ (2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] / denominator )

Which is,

sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is the same as our expression for v_max.

So yes, option D is correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is purely potential:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is purely kinetic. In relativistic mechanics, the total energy is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the total energy at \( x = A \) and \( x = 0 \), we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \gamma m c^2.
\]

Solving for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}.
\]

Rearranging and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \left( \frac{2m c^2}{kA^2} \right)^2.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2m c^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the expression given in **Option D**. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve incorrect denominators or terms that do not align with the derived expression.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic result and does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
