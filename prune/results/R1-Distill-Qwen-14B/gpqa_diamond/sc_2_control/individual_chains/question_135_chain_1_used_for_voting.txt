Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, right, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction terms. So the X field couples to fermions, which implies that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

But wait, the structure of the Lagrangian—let me parse it. The term looks like a Yukawa coupling. The standard Yukawa term is something like g ψ̄ ψ X, where g is the coupling constant. So in this case, the interaction is proportional to (v + X), and the fermion fields ψ_f are in the middle. So the interaction is with fermions ψ_f.

So the X boson can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that the interaction term allows. Now, let's think about the possible decay products. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV for the decay to be kinematically allowed.

Wait, but the mass of the fermion pair is 2 times the mass of each fermion, since they are a pair. So the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, wait, the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So for a decay X → f f̄ to be possible, the sum of the rest masses of the fermions must be less than or equal to X's mass. Because in the center-of-mass frame, the energy available is the mass of X. So for the decay to happen, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be ≤ 6 GeV.

So I need to list all the possible fermion pairs where each fermion has a mass such that 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV. Let's list the masses of the known fermions.

The fermion masses (approximate):

- Electron (e): 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.0045 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV

Wait, but wait, how about the quark masses? Because in the decay, they are produced as a quark and antiquark pair. So, for example, u quark and anti-u quark. Each has a mass of about 0.003 GeV, so combined 0.006 GeV. That's way less than 6 GeV, so uū is allowed.

Same with d, s, c quarks. Let's check their masses:

u: ~2 MeV → 0.002 GeV
d: ~4 MeV → 0.004 GeV
s: ~100 MeV → 0.1 GeV
c: ~1.25-1.5 GeV (let me take 1.5 for safety)
b: ~4.5 GeV
t: 173 GeV, way too big.

So for quarks, the possible pairs are u, d, s, c. Wait, but wait, let me think: when X decays, it can produce any fermion pair. So for each fermion f, m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV, because 2m_f ≤6 → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So for quarks:

u: 0.002 GeV → allowed
d: 0.004 GeV → allowed
s: 0.1 GeV → allowed
c: ~1.5 GeV → allowed
b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5*2=9 GeV >6 GeV → Not allowed.

So quarks: u, d, s, c, but not b or t.

For leptons:

e: ~0.0005 GeV → allowed
μ: ~0.105 GeV → allowed
τ: ~1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV <6? Wait, 2m_τ=3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ is allowed.

But wait, the tau's mass is about 1.777 GeV. So 2m_τ is about 3.55 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ can be produced.

What about the muon? m_μ ~0.1 GeV, so 2m_μ is 0.2 GeV, which is allowed.

Similarly, e is even lighter.

So the possible fermion pairs are:

u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e ē, μ μ̄, τ τ̄.

Wait, but what about the top quark? t is way too heavy, so t t̄ is impossible.

Wait, the problem states "fermions" in the Lagrangian. So does the interaction include all possible fermions, or only certain ones? The problem says the interaction is with ψ_f, which is the fermion field. So if all fermions are included, then all the allowed ones with m_f ≤3 GeV can be decay products.

But wait, let's look at the options.

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

But b b̄ would require 2m_b = 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So option A includes b, which is impossible, so A is not correct.

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but c c̄: 2m_c is about 3 GeV. So 3 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

So this option includes c, which is allowed. But option B doesn't include b, so that's correct.

Wait, but what about the tau? Their mass is about 1.78 GeV. 2m_τ is 3.56 GeV, which is allowed. So option B includes τ, which is allowed.

So B includes c, s, u, d, τ, μ, e.

But what about the charm quark? 2m_c is around 3 GeV, so allowed. So yes, c is allowed.

Wait, but what about the top quark? No, the top is way too heavy.

So the possible decay channels are all the fermion pairs where m_f ≤3 GeV.

So the allowed decays are:

c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

But wait, the question asks which are kinematically allowed. So any fermion pair where the sum of their masses is ≤ 6 GeV.

So the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That seems correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t's mass is way above 6 GeV, so decay into t t̄ is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so D is incorrect.

Option A says b is allowed, which is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the quarks. The X boson mass is 6 GeV. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄.

So the correct decay channels are all the ones that don't require more than 6 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are:

e, μ, τ (leptons), and u, d, s, c (quarks).

So the decays would include c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that.

So the correct answer is option B.

The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions, allowing decays into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the combined rest mass of the fermion pair \( 2m_f \) must be less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \): \( m_u \approx 0.002 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u = 0.004 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( d \): \( m_d \approx 0.0045 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d = 0.009 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( s \): \( m_s \approx 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( c \): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c = 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( b \): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b = 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
   - \( t \): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e \): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \mu \): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \tau \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Allowed Decay Channels:
From the above analysis, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are:
\[
X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^-.
\]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b = 9.0 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Matches the allowed decays \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

**Answer: B**
