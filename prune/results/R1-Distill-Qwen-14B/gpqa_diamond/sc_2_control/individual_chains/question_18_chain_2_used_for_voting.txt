Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, let's see what the question gives me. 

First, the stars have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the masses aren't directly relevant here. I'll keep that in mind but focus on the abundance ratios given.

The elemental abundances provided are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2

And the Sun's photospheric composition is:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, but how do these tie into the ratios of silicon in the two stars?

I remember that the notation [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y relative to the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. That means:

log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0 → log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun = -4.5 → nFe/nH for Star_1 is 10^(-4.5), same as the Sun.

Wait, but let me think. If [Fe/H] is 0, that means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So Star_1 has the same Fe/H as the Sun.

But [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So in Star_1, the ratio of Si to Fe is higher than in the Sun by 10^0.3. Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So nX/nY = 10^{([X/Y]_star - [X/Y]_sun)}.

Wait, but wait. Let me be precise. [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun → so log(nX/nY)_star = [X/Y]_star + log(nX/nY)_sun.

Wait no, the definition is [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) − log10(nX/nY)_sun. So, [X/Y]_star = log(nX/nY, star) - log(nX/nY, sun) → so log(nX/nY, star) = [X/Y]_star + log(nX/nY, sun).

But I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me double-check. Oh wait, no. The standard definition is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) − log(nX/nY)_sun. So if [X/Y] is positive, nX/nY in the star is higher than in the sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but what is log(nSi/nFe)_sun? Let's think. We know nFe/nH for the Sun is 10^(-4.5). What about nSi/nFe?

Wait, perhaps I should find the solar ratios first.

In the Sun, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). And the given 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

But for Si, the question doesn't give the solar abundance. Oh wait, perhaps I can find it using the given [Mg/Si] for Star_2. Or maybe I can find nSi in the Sun using [Mg/Si], but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, maybe I should try to find the ratios for each star and then compute the silicon ratio between them.

Let me start with Star_1.

Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H is solar. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as solar, which is 10^(-4.5).
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + log(nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but I don't know log(nSi/nFe)_sun. Hmm. Maybe I can express it in terms of [Si/Fe]_sun?

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] would be zero, because if everything is solar, then [Si/Fe] is 0. So for the Sun, [Si/Fe]_sun = 0 → log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0 → nSi/nFe = 1.

Wait, wait, no. Because if [X/Y] = 0, it means nX/nY = nX/nY)_sun, so yes, nSi/nFe = nSi/nFe)_sun. But if [X/Y]_sun is zero, then nX/nY is 1.

Wait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because [X/Y] is a logarithmic scale. So for the Sun, [X/Y]_sun is 0, so log(nX/nY) = log(nX/nY)_sun → which is the same as the sun's ratio. But since the sun's ratio is itself, that's correct.

So for the Sun, log(nSi/nFe)_sun = [Si/Fe]_sun = 0.

So for Star_1, log(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 → nSi/nFe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

Wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2? Let's see: 10^0.3 is about 2? 10^0.3 is around 2 because 10^0.3 ≈ 2 (since 10^0.3010 is about 2). Yes, so nSi/nFe for Star_1 is about 2.

So nSi = 2 * nFe.

But in Star_1, nFe = nFe_sun * (since [Fe/H]_1 is zero → same Fe/H as the Sun. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5), same as the Sun. So nFe is 10^(-4.5) * nH.

So nSi = 2 * nFe = 2 * 10^(-4.5) * nH.

So nSi/nH for Star_1 is 2 * 10^(-4.5) ≈ 2*(3.16e-5) = 6.32e-5.

Wait, but the Sun's nSi isn't given directly. Hmm, perhaps I should find that.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is not given. Wait, in Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. So let's see what that tells us.

Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → nMg/nH = nMg/nH)_sun. So nMg = 10^(-5) * nH (since for Sun, nMg/nH = 10^-5).

- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

Wait, so for Star_2, log(nMg/nSi)_2 = [Mg/Si]_2 + log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

But for the Sun, [Mg/Si]_sun is log(nMg/nSi)_sun = ?

Wait, because in the Sun, [X/Y] is zero for elements relative to themselves.

Wait, no. Wait, the [Mg/Si]_sun is log(nMg/nSi)_sun, which would be a certain value. But without knowing the Sun's Mg/Si ratio, I can't directly compute it. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express nSi in Star_2 in terms of nMg and the [Mg/Si] ratio.

Wait, let's think about Star_2.

nMg = 10^(-5) * nH (since [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → same as Sun).

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + log(nMg/nSi)_sun.

Wait, but I don't know the Sun's [Mg/Si]. Oh, wait, but the Sun's [Mg/H] is 7 → 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

Similarly, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is 0. But that's not directly helpful.

Wait, maybe I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] value. Let's compute that.

In the Sun: nMg/nH =1e-5, and nFe/nH=1e-4.5.

But I don't have nSi in the Sun. Wait, perhaps I can find it using the solar [Si/Fe].

Wait, the Sun's [Si/Fe] is 0, which means log(nSi/nFe)_sun =0 → nSi/nFe = 1.

So in the Sun, nSi = nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH.

So in the Sun, nMg =1e-5 * nH, and nSi =1e-4.5 *nH.

So the Sun's Mg/Si ratio is (nMg/nSi)_sun = (1e-5)/(1e-4.5) )= 1e-0.5 → 1/sqrt(10) ≈ 0.316.

So log(nMg/nSi)_sun = log(0.316) ≈ -0.5.

Wait, because 1e-0.5 ≈ 0.316, and log(0.316) is approximately -0.5.

So for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(nMg/nSi)_2 = 0.3 + (-0.5) = -0.2.

So nMg/nSi =10^(-0.2) ≈ 0.63.

So nMg = 0.63 * nSi.

But in Star_2, nMg is 1e-5 * nH, as [Mg/H]_2 is 0.

So 1e-5 *nH = 0.63 * nSi → nSi = (1e-5 / 0.63) * nH ≈ (1.587e-5) *nH.

So nSi in Star_2 is approximately 1.587e-5 per H atom.

Now, let's get back to Star_1.

In Star_1, nSi = 2 * nFe.

But nFe in Star_1 is 1e-4.5 *nH.

So nSi = 2 *1e-4.5 *nH = 2e-4.5 *nH.

Compute 1e-4.5: 10^(-4.5) is about 3.16e-5.

So 2e-4.5 ≈ 6.32e-5.

So nSi in Star_1 is approximately 6.32e-5 per H.

In Star_2, nSi is about 1.587e-5 per H.

So the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = (6.32e-5) / (1.587e-5) ≈ 6.32 / 1.587 ≈ 4.

Wait, because 1.587 is approximately 1.587, and 6.32 / 1.587 ≈ 4.

So the ratio is about 4, which is option A (3.9) or approximately 4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4.

Wait but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

For Star_1:

nSi = 2 * 1e-4.5.

1e-4.5 is 3.16e-5.

So 2 *3.16e-5 is 6.32e-5.

For Star_2:

nMg =1e-5 *nH.

nMg =0.63 *nSi → nSi =1e-5 /0.63 = approximately 1.587e-5.

So ratio is 6.32e-5 /1.587e-5 = approx 4 (since 6.32 /1.587 is about 4).

So the ratio is approximately 4, which is option A (~3.9), but let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

So option A is ~3.9, which is very close to 4. So that's the answer.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundance data and use the definitions of logarithmic abundance ratios.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex → Fe/H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex → The ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times higher than in the Sun.

   Since Fe/H is solar, the number density of Fe in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Fe}} = 10^{-4.5} \, n_{\text{H}}
   \]  
   Using [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the number density of Si in Star_1 is:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}} = 2 \times 10^{-4.5} \, n_{\text{H}} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{-5} \, n_{\text{H}}
   \]

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex → Mg/H is the same as the Sun.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex → The ratio of Mg to Si in Star_2 is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times higher than in the Sun.

   Since Mg/H is solar, the number density of Mg in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Mg}} = 10^{-5} \, n_{\text{H}}
   \]  
   Using [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the number density of Si in Star_2 is:  
   \[
   n_{\text{Si}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg}}}{10^{0.3}} = \frac{10^{-5}}{2} \, n_{\text{H}} \approx 1.587 \times 10^{-5} \, n_{\text{H}}
   \]

3. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is:  
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{6.32 \times 10^{-5}}{1.587 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 4
   \]  
   This value is closest to option **A (~3.9)**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **4**, which corresponds to option **A**.
