Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, relativistic effects become significant. So I probably need to use some formulas from special relativity here.

First, let me read the problem again. The nucleus is called X and it's defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make its isotope Li-6, because the atomic number is protons (3) plus neutrons (3) equals 6. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, so the mass is that of 6 nucleons.

Wait, but when calculating relativistic energy, the rest mass is important. The rest mass energy would be mc². So I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) and multiply by 6. Wait, because the nucleus is made of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, right? So total of 6 nucleons. So the total mass would be 6 times the mass of a nucleon. 

I think the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron, maybe a bit less? Oh wait, actually, the neutron has a slightly lower rest mass than a proton. But for a rough calculation, perhaps we can approximate them as similar? Or maybe I should look up the exact values. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as a whole. Hmmm. Let me think: for heavy ions like in RHIC, they usually use the mass of the entire nucleus. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the given data.

Wait, the problem says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6. I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is given or can be derived. But since I don't have exact values, maybe I'll proceed by using the rest mass of the nucleus as a whole.

So the first thing I need is the total energy of the nucleus. In a collider, particles are accelerated to a certain kinetic energy, and the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in high-energy physics, when they say the energy of the collider, are they talking about the kinetic energy per particle or the total energy (rest + kinetic)? I think it's the total energy, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again: in colliders, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Or wait, no, sometimes people refer to the kinetic energy, but in relativistic terms, it's the total energy that matters because the kinetic energy is just a portion of it. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for the total energy E of a relativistic particle is gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if the speed is 0.96c, I can compute gamma.

Let me compute gamma for v = 0.96c. So beta is v/c = 0.96. Then gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96²)).

Let me compute 0.96 squared: 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28? Let me check: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So yeah, gamma is about 3.57142857.

So the total energy E is gamma * m c². So I need to find m, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Li-6 has a mass of approximately... I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u), but wait, each u is about 931.5 MeV/c². Wait, but wait, the mass of the nucleus is actually slightly less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of binding energy, but for this calculation, maybe we can approximate it as 6 * (mass of a proton), but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons." So that's Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact value, but since I don't have that, I'll proceed with 6.015 u.

So 6.015 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives the mass in MeV/c². Let me compute that. 6.015 * 931.5 = Let's compute 6 *931.5 = 5589, and 0.015 * 931.5 ≈13.9725. So total is approximately 5589 +13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV. So about 5603 MeV = 5.603 GeV. So m c² is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Wait, wait, no. Because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015 u is 6.015 * 931.5 = let me compute that more accurately.

6 *931.5 = 5589. 0.015 *931.5=13.9725. So 5589 +13.9725 = 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV. So m c² ≈5.603 GeV. So E = gamma * m c². Gamma is approximately 3.5714.

So E = 3.5714 *5.603 GeV.

Wait, let me compute that. 3.5714 *5.603:

First, 3 *5.603=16.809.

0.5714 *5.603: let me compute 0.5 *5.603=2.8015, and 0.0714*5.603≈0.401. So together 2.8015 +0.401≈3.2025.

Total E ≈16.809 +3.2025 =20.0115 GeV.

Hmm, so approximately 20.01 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option D is 21.419, which is higher.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the computation of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma more precisely.

Beta is 0.96. So beta squared is 0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

But perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so the square root is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.57142857 *5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

3 *5.6029725=16.8089175.

0.57142857 *5.6029725: Let's compute this.

0.5 *5.6029725 = 2.80148625.

0.07142857 *5.6029725: Let's approximate. 0.07 *5.6029725=0.392208075. Then 0.00142857 *5.6029725≈0.008. So sum is ≈0.392208075 +0.008=0.400208075.

So 0.57142857 *5.6029725≈2.80148625 +0.400208075≈3.201694325.

Now add the 3* part: 16.8089175 +3.201694325=20.010611825 GeV.

So E ≈20.0106 GeV. So approximately 20.0106 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. But wait, my calculation is about 20.01 GeV, which is not matching exactly. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, maybe I should not approximate the mass. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6. The exact value is about 6.0150768 u. Wait, more accurately, the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0150768 u. So the exact calculation would be 6.0150768 *931.5 MeV/u.

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0150768 *931.5 = Let's compute that:

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.0000768 *931.5≈ approx 7.16 MeV.

Wait, 0.0000768 *931.5 = 0.0768 *93.15 ≈7.16 MeV.

So sum is 9.315 +4.6575 +7.16= 21.1325 MeV.

So total m c² =5589 +21.1325 =5610.1325 MeV =5.6101325 GeV.

Wait, so earlier I had 5.603 GeV, but with more accurate calculation, it's 5.6101325 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6101325 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6101325.

Again, 3 *5.6101325=16.8303975.

0.57142857 *5.6101325.

0.5 *5.6101325=2.80506625.

0.07142857 *5.6101325= approx 0.07 *5.6101325=0.392709275. And 0.00142857 *5.6101325≈0.00803. So total ≈0.392709275 +0.00803≈0.400739275.

So the 0.57142857 part is 2.80506625 +0.400739275=3.205805525.

So E=16.8303975 +3.205805525=20.036203 GeV.

So about 20.0362 GeV. Now looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is higher than that.

Hmm. So maybe my assumption about the mass is incorrect. Perhaps I should use the mass of a single nucleon and multiply by 6.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each nucleon as having a mass of approximately 938 MeV/c². So 6 nucleons would have 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So let's compute E again with m c² =5.628 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857. So E =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628: 0.5 *5.628=2.814. 0.07142857 *5.628≈0.403.

So sum is 2.814 +0.403=3.217.

Total E=16.884 +3.217=20.101 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.10 GeV. So looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. But my calculation with the sum of nucleons is about 20.10 GeV, which is near option C. But why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the exact mass of the nucleus. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has an atomic mass of approximately 6.0150768 u. So exact calculation: 6.0150768 *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0150768 *931.5 = let's compute exactly.

0.01*931.5=9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.0000768 *931.5= let's compute that.

0.0000768 *931.5 = 0.0768 *93.15.

0.0768 *93= approx 7.13, and 0.0768 *0.15=0.0115, so total about 7.1415 MeV.

So sum is 9.315+4.6575 +7.1415 = 21.114 MeV.

So total m c² =5589 +21.114=5610.114 MeV =5.610114 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.610114 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.610114.

Let me do this step by step.

3 *5.610114 =16.830342.

0.57142857 *5.610114: Let's compute this part.

0.5 *5.610114 =2.805057.

0.07142857 *5.610114: Let's calculate 0.07 *5.610114=0.39270798. 0.00142857 *5.610114≈0.00805.

So sum is 0.39270798 +0.00805≈0.400758.

So 0.57142857 *5.610114 ≈2.805057 +0.400758 ≈3.205815.

So E=16.830342 +3.205815 =20.036157 GeV.

Wait, around 20.036 GeV.

But the options are:

A)18.475

B)23.069

C)20.132

D)21.419

So 20.036 is closest to option C, which is 20.132. But that's a difference of about 0.096 GeV, which is about 100 MeV. Hmm. That's a significant difference. Did I make a mistake in the gamma calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me recheck.

v =0.96c, so beta =0.96.

gamma =1/sqrt(1- (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, but maybe I should compute sqrt(0.0784) more precisely. Let me compute 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise method, like using a calculator approach.

Wait, what's 1/(sqrt(0.0784))?

Yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=3.57142857.

So the calculation seems correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single proton for the nucleus, which would be way off, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus's kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh! Wait, maybe the question is referring to the kinetic energy (K) rather than the total energy (E). Because sometimes in these problems, the energy given is the kinetic energy.

The formula for kinetic energy in relativity is K = (gamma -1) m c².

So let me compute that. So for gamma=3.57142857,

K= (3.57142857 -1) *5.610114 GeV.

3.57142857-1=2.57142857.

So 2.57142857 *5.610114 = ?

Compute 2 *5.610114=11.220228.

0.57142857 *5.610114, which we've computed before as approximately 3.205815.

So K=11.220228 +3.205815 ≈14.426043 GeV.

So if the question is about kinetic energy, that would be about 14.43 GeV, which isn't any of the options. So probably, the question is asking for the total energy.

Wait, but the options are all about 20 GeV, so it's more likely that I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the Li-6 nucleus is not 6.015 u but something else. Wait, let me look up the exact mass of Li-6. Hmm, I remember that the exact mass is approximately 6.0150768 u. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value for gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for the total energy in terms of rest mass and velocity, but I think that's what I did.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy equation E² = (pc)² c² + (m c²)². But for a particle moving at v, p = gamma m v.

So E = gamma m c², which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute beta=0.96.

Beta squared is 0.96^2 =0.9216.

1 - beta squared =0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma is 3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using a calculator method for more accuracy. Let me compute 0.96 in terms of beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise decimal places.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator to compute 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) more accurately.

Wait, 1 - 0.96^2 = 1 - 0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28 exactly. So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So that's correct.

So then, perhaps the mistake is in the mass calculation. Let me compute 6.0150768 u *931.5 MeV/u.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0150768 *931.5: Let's compute this precisely.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575 MeV.

0.0000768 *931.5=0.0768 *931.5 = (0.07 *931.5) + (0.0068*931.5).

0.07 *931.5=65.205.

0.0068 *931.5=6.3322.

So 65.205+6.3322=71.5372.

Wait, no, wait, I think that's miscalculating. Because 0.0000768 is 7.68e-5.

So 7.68e-5 *931.5 = approximately 0.0716 MeV. Because 931.5 *0.00007 is about 0.065205, and 931.5 *0.0000068= approximately 0.006332. So sum is 0.065205 +0.006332=0.071537 MeV.

So the 0.0000768 part contributes about 0.0715 MeV.

So sum all parts:

9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.071537=14.044037 MeV.

So m c² =5589 +14.044037=5603.044037 MeV =5.603044 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603044 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603044.

3 *5.603044 =16.809132.

0.57142857 *5.603044.

Compute 0.5 *5.603044=2.801522.

0.07142857 *5.603044: 5.603044 *0.07=0.392213, and 5.603044*(0.00142857)= approx 0.008.

So sum 0.392213 +0.008=0.400213.

So 0.57142857 *5.603044 ≈2.801522 +0.400213≈3.201735.

So E=16.809132 +3.201735 =20.010867 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Still, the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Let me think about other possibilities. Oh, wait, perhaps the mass is being taken as the mass of a proton, but multiplied by 6 would give:

Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², so 6 *938=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.628.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628= Let me compute that.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628 ≈0.07 *5.628=0.394, 0.00142857 *5.628 ≈0.008.

So 0.394 +0.008=0.402. So sum 2.814+0.402=3.216.

So total E=16.884 +3.216=20.1 GeV.

Which is 20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV. So that's very close.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton times the number of nucleons, rather than the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus. So perhaps I should go with that approach.

So with m c² =5.628 GeV, E=3.57142857 *5.628 =20.1 GeV. So option C is 20.132, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that my calculation is 20.01 GeV, but perhaps the precise calculation gives 20.132 GeV. How?

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

Wait, beta is 0.96.

Compute gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2).

Compute 1 - beta^2 =1 - 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=3.571428571428571..., which is exactly 25/7, because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857...

Wait, 25 ÷ 7 is 3.57142857..., so yes, gamma is 25/7.

So 25/7 * m c².

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculation of the mass. Let me compute the exact mass again.

Li-6: mass is 6.0150768 u.

6.0150768 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0150768 *931.5= let's compute this precisely.

0.0150768 *931.5 = ?

Let me compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.005 *931.5=4.6575.

0.0000768 *931.5=0.0768 *931.5= 71.5372 MeV? No, wait, wait, wait. No, 0.0000768 is 7.68e-5, which multiplied by 931.5 gives 0.0715372 MeV.

So sum: 9.315 +4.6575=13.9725 +0.0715372=14.0440372 MeV.

So m c² =5589 +14.0440372=5603.0440372 MeV =5.6030440372 GeV.

So E= (25/7) *5.6030440372 GeV.

Compute 25/7=3.57142857...

25/7 *5.6030440372.

Let me compute 5.6030440372 *25 =140.07610093.

Then divide by 7: 140.07610093 /7=20.01087156 GeV.

So E≈20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, but the option is 20.132 GeV. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the nucleus is moving, so the total energy is gamma times m c², but the mass m is the rest mass of each nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6. Let me compute it again. Li-6 has a mass of 6.0150768 u.

So 6.0150768 u *931.5 MeV/u =5.603044 GeV.

Then E=gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.603044 GeV=20.0109 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is expecting the kinetic energy. Wait, but then the calculation was 14.426 GeV, which isn't matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem statement. Let me read it again.

The question says: "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c."

Wait, in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy per particle. But perhaps the question is considering the total energy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the kinetic energy is given as a certain percentage, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is being taken as the mass of a single proton. Let's try that.

Assuming m =938 MeV/c².

So m c²=0.938 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *0.938 =approx 3.5714 *0.938.

Compute 3 *0.938=2.814.

0.5714 *0.938: 0.5 *0.938=0.469, 0.0714 *0.938≈0.067. So sum 0.469+0.067=0.536.

So E=2.814 +0.536=3.35 GeV.

But that's way lower than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken as the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each neutron having a slightly lower mass.

But I think it's standard to approximate the mass of a neutron as about 939 MeV/c², so let's compute that way.

So, 3 protons:3*938=2814 MeV.

3 neutrons:3*939=2817 MeV.

Total:2814 +2817=5631 MeV=5.631 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.631 GeV.

3.5714 *5.631.

3 *5.631=16.893.

0.5714 *5.631: 0.5*5.631=2.8155, 0.0714*5.631≈0.403.

So sum 2.8155+0.403=3.2185.

Total E=16.893 +3.2185=20.1115 GeV.

Which is about 20.11 GeV, very close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the correct approach is to take the mass as the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons, each neutron being about 939 MeV.

So E≈20.11 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

But why the slight discrepancy? Perhaps due to more precise neutron and proton masses.

Alternatively, the problem may have used more precise values for gamma.

Wait, what if I compute gamma with more precision?

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.9216.

1 - beta squared= 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma=3.57142857.

So no improvement there.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely using a calculator method.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps I can compute E = gamma * m c², and the exact mass is 5.603044 GeV.

So 3.57142857 *5.603044.

Compute 3 *5.603044=16.809132.

0.57142857 *5.603044.

Let me compute this with more precision.

5.603044 × 0.5 =2.801522.

5.603044 ×0.07142857.

Compute 5.603044 *0.07 =0.39221308.

5.603044 *0.00142857= approximately 0.008.

So 0.39221308 +0.008=0.40021308.

So sum 2.801522 +0.40021308=3.20173508.

So total E=16.809132 +3.20173508=20.010867 GeV.

So 20.010867 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV.

Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy. Wait, let me compute the kinetic energy again.

Kinetic energy K= (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma-1=2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 *5.603044 GeV.

2 *5.603044=11.206088.

0.57142857 *5.603044.

0.5 *5.603044=2.801522.

0.07142857 *5.603044≈0.400213.

Sum 2.801522 +0.400213=3.201735.

So K=11.206088 +3.201735=14.407823 GeV.

Which is about 14.408 GeV. None of the options match.

So perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the initial calculation, which gives about 20.01 GeV, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus as 6 times the rest mass of a proton, which would be 5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV.

So E=gamma *5.628 GeV=3.57142857 *5.628=20.101 GeV.

Which is very close to option C, 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would yield 20.132 GeV. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628 with more precision.

3.57142857 multiplied by 5.628.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.028=0.09999999996.

Adding them up: 17.85714285 +2.14285714=20.0 +0.09999999996=20.099999996 GeV.

Hmm, so that's approximately 20.1 GeV. So why is the option C 20.132 GeV?

Ah, perhaps I should compute using more precise values for gamma and m c².

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise steps.

Another approach: perhaps the problem uses the formula for the total energy and I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact calculation of gamma.

Wait, beta =0.96.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857...

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps the discrepancy arises from the way the mass is computed.

Wait, could the problem be using the mass of the lithium ion with 3 neutrons but considering charge, perhaps losing some mass due to electrons? No, because when dealing with nuclei, electrons are not part of the nucleus, and the rest mass is just the nucleons.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula but considering the nucleus as a collection of free nucleons. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact mass values for protons and neutrons, like proton mass is 938.272 MeV, neutron is 939.565 MeV.

So let's compute the exact mass of Li-6 as 3 protons +3 neutrons.

Proton mass: 938.272 MeV.

Neutron mass:939.565 MeV.

So 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.633511 GeV.

Compute that.

3 *5.633511=16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511.

0.5 *5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511≈ approx 0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈0.404.

So sum:2.8167555 +0.404≈3.2207555.

So E=16.900533 +3.2207555≈20.1212885 GeV.

That's approximately 20.121 GeV, which is even closer to option C, 20.132 GeV.

Ah, that's probably why the correct answer is option C.

So to recap, using exact proton and neutron masses, the total mass is 5.6335 GeV, multiplied by gamma 3.5714 gives about 20.121 GeV, which is very close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

So the correct answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the lithium-6 (Li-6) nucleus is 0.96c, we use relativistic energy principles. The total energy \( E \) of a relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the particle, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \beta = v/c = 0.96 \). Then:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.96^2}}
\]

\[
\beta^2 = 0.96^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - \beta^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy \( m c^2 \)
The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of approximately \( 6.0150768 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m c^2 = 6.0150768 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}
\]

Breaking this down:
- \( 6 \times 931.5 = 5589 \, \text{MeV} \)
- \( 0.0150768 \times 931.5 \approx 14.044 \, \text{MeV} \)

\[
m c^2 = 5589 + 14.044 \approx 5603.044 \, \text{MeV} = 5.603044 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the total energy \( E \)
Using \( E = \gamma m c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.603044 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this down:
- \( 3 \times 5.603044 = 16.809132 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( 0.5714 \times 5.603044 \approx 3.201735 \, \text{GeV} \)

\[
E = 16.809132 + 3.201735 \approx 20.010867 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Refine the calculation using more precise values
To match the options, the problem likely assumes the rest mass of Li-6 as the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Using more precise values:
- Proton mass: \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
- Neutron mass: \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)

\[
m c^2 = 3(938.272) + 3(939.565) = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} = 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Now compute \( E \):

\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.633511 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this down:
- \( 3 \times 5.633511 = 16.900533 \, \text{GeV} \)
- \( 0.5714 \times 5.633511 \approx 3.220756 \, \text{GeV} \)

\[
E = 16.900533 + 3.220756 \approx 20.121289 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This value is very close to option C, \( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \), considering rounding differences.

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC is approximately **20.132 GeV**, corresponding to option C.
