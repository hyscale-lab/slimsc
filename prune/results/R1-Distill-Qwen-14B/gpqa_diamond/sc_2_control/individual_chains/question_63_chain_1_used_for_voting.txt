Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, it's about the rotation-vibration model. Let me think. So the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, in the rigid rotor approximation, the energy levels are quantized, but the non-rigid one considers bond vibrations as well. But wait, the question is about switching states, probably involving a transition in energy.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so that would be the ground state. So when a photon is absorbed, it must be promoting the molecule to the next higher energy state. But wait, what's the next state? In quantum systems, transitions are usually between adjacent energy levels. But wait, the model is rotation-vibration, so it's a combination of rotational and vibrational energy.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energy levels. The energy of a diatomic molecule can be considered as a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. The fundamental vibrational state is the ground state (v=0), and the rotational energy depends on the rotational quantum number J.

But wait, the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest increase in energy. So maybe it's the first excited state, either in vibration or rotation.

Wait, but how do the energy levels work? The total energy is E = E_rot + E_vib. The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v, where v is the vibrational quantum number (0,1,2...).

Wait no, the ground state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the fundamental state is J=0, v=0. The next state could either be J=1, v=0 (rotational excitation) or J=0, v=1 (vibrational excitation). But which transition requires less energy?

Because the question says the photon causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy, so it's the transition with the smallest photon energy needed.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the question is considering only vibrational or only rotational transitions. Wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state is the one that requires the least energy to get to. So I need to find which transition (vibrational or rotational) needs less energy.

Let me calculate the energies for the possible transitions.

First, vibrational energy: The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w. Because E_vib = (1/2 h w) + h w v. So the difference when v changes from 0 to 1 is h w.

Rotational energy: For J=0 to J=1, the energy goes from 0 to B * 1*(1+1) = 2B. So the energy difference is 2B.

I need to find which is smaller: h w or 2B.

So if 2B < h w, then the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the next state. Otherwise, vibrational.

Given the parameters:

Masses: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 +2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 1 amu is about 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

The rotational constant B is given by h/(8 π² μ R²). Wait, B is usually given by (h)/(8π² I), where I is the moment of inertia I = μ R².

So B = h/(8 π² μ R²)

Wait, let me compute B.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

So substituting:

B = (6.626e-34) / (8 * π² * μ * R²)

Compute denominator:

8 * (pi)^2 ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

μ is 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m, so R² =4e-20 m².

So denominator: 78.9568 *3.01e-27 kg *4e-20 m².

Let me compute that:

3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *1.204e-46 ≈95.15e-46 = 9.515e-45.

So B =6.626e-34 /9.515e-45 ≈approx 6.96e9 rad/s.

Wait, 6.626e-34 /9.515e-45 is 6.626e-34 / 9.515e-45 = approx 6.626 /9.515 * 1e11 → 0.696e11 →6.96e10 rad/s? Wait, because 1e-34 /1e-45 is 1e11. So 6.626e-34 /9.515e-45 = (6.626/9.515) * 1e11 ≈0.696 *1e11=6.96e10 rad/s.

So B ≈6.96e10 rad/s.

Wait, but the given angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So 2B is about 1.39e11 rad/s.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w. So h w =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s=2.65e-19 J.

Wait, but we need to compare 2B and h w. Wait, no, the energy differences for rotational and vibrational transitions.

Wait, rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 requires energy 2B, and vibrational from v=0 to v=1 requires h w.

But wait, actually, in terms of energy, the rotational energy is quantized but the vibrational energy is quantized as well. So the question is, which transition requires less energy.

But wait, I think I made a mistake. Because the energy for rotational levels is E_rot = B J (J+1). So the energy difference when J increases by 1 (from J=0 to J=1) is E = 2B.

Wait, but to get the actual energy in Joules, since B is in rad/s, E_rot = ħ B J (J+1), but perhaps I should think in terms of frequency for the photon.

Wait, photons have energy E_photon = h f, where f is frequency. So the frequency of the photon would need to match the energy difference.

Wait, the question asks about the photon's momentum. Since momentum p is related to the photon's energy via E = pc (for photons, since they have no mass, E=pc). So if I can find the energy, I can find p.

But wait, first I need to determine whether the photon's energy corresponds to a rotational or vibrational transition.

So which transition has lower energy: the first rotational or the first vibrational?

Let me compute the energies.

Rotational transition (J=0 → J=1): ΔE_rot = 2B.

But B is 6.96e10 rad/s. So 2B=1.39e11 rad/s.

Energy is E_rot = ΔE_rot * ħ? No, wait, B is already expressed in terms of angular frequency. Wait, E_rot is in terms of B, which is in rad/s.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) J (J+1). Which can be written as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant in energy units. Wait, but earlier I calculated B in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, perhaps I should better compute the energy differences in terms of Joules.

So B as the rotational constant is ħ²/(2 I) = (h/(2π))²/(2 I) ) = h²/(8 π² I). But I=μ R². So B is h²/(8 π² μ R²), which when multiplied by J (J+1) gives the rotational energy in Joules.

Wait, so let me compute B in Joules.

Wait, B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈4.39e-67 J²·s².

μ is 3.01e-27 kg.

R is 2e-10 m, so R²=4e-20 m².

So denominator: 8 π² μ R² = 8 * (9.8696) *3.01e-27 *4e-20.

Compute denominator:

8 *9.8696≈78.9568.

3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 *1.204e-46 ≈95.15e-46 →9.515e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.515e-45 ≈4.39e-67 /9.515e-45 ≈4.61e-23 J.

Wait, so B≈4.61e-23 J. So the energy difference when J increases by 1 (from 0 to 1) is 2B =9.22e-23 J.

Now the vibrational energy difference is from v=0 to v=1. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w v.

Wait, the energy difference ΔE_vib = h w (1). So h w =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s =2.65e-19 J.

So comparing the two energy differences: 9.22e-23 J (rotational) vs. 2.65e-19 J (vibrational). Clearly, the rotational transition requires less energy.

Therefore, the photon must have energy equal to the rotational transition, 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, wait a second. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can go to either J=1, v=0 or J=0, v=1. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition is lower in energy? The rotational one because 9e-23 is much less than 2.6e-19.

So the photon's energy must be 9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the photon's energy is E_photon = h f = p c, since for photons, E = pc. So p = E_photon / c.

Wait, but wait, the photon's momentum p is given by E_photon = p c. So p = E_photon / c.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = approx 3.07e-31 kg·m/s? Wait, that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.07e-31 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 N·s → 1.9e-28 kg·m/s.

Option B: 2.3e-27 N·s.

Option C: 1.1e-27 N·s.

Option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

Wait, my calculation gave 3e-31 N·s, which is much smaller than any of the options. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing B.

Wait, let me recompute B more carefully.

Compute B = h²/(8 π² μ R² )

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

μ is 3.01e-27 kg.

R squared is (2e-10 m)^2=4e-20 m².

So denominator is 8 * π² * μ * R² =8 * (9.8696) * 3.01e-27 *4e-20.

Compute 8 *9.8696 ≈78.957.

3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46.

Multiply by 78.957: 78.957 *1.204e-46 = approx 95.15e-46 →9.515e-45.

So denominator is 9.515e-45.

Then B =4.39e-67 /9.515e-45 = (4.39 /9.515) * 1e-22 → approx 0.461 *1e-22 →4.61e-23 J.

So that's correct. So the energy difference is 2B=9.22e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.22e-23 J.

Then, p= E_photon /c =9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are close to that. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe the question is considering the transition to the next energy level where both rotational and vibrational levels change, like from (J=0, v=0) to (J=1, v=0) or (J=0, v=1). But I thought the energy required for J=1 is lower.

Wait, but maybe the question is looking for the transition to the next state in the vibrational series, not the rotational. Or perhaps I've confused the energy levels.

Wait, maybe the question is about the Raman active transitions, but no, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the vibrational energy affects the rotational energy. But maybe the question is treating the molecule as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator, so the total energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies.

So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be either J=1, v=0 or J=0, v=1.

As I calculated, the energy for J=1 is 9.22e-23 J, and for v=1 is 2.65e-19 J. So the J=1 transition is lower energy.

So the photon's energy should be 9.22e-23 J.

But the options are much larger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the bond length in a different unit. Wait, the bond length given is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of B.

Wait, in some derivations, B is given in cm^-1. Maybe I should convert units.

Wait, 1 cm^-1 is about 1.986e-23 J. So if B is, say, 10 cm^-1, the energy would be 1.986e-22 J.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for B. Let me check.

The rotational constant B in energy units is given by:

B = (h²) / (8 π² I)

where I is moment of inertia, which is μ R².

So yes, that's correct. So B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

Wait, let's compute B again step by step.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

h squared: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 *1e-68 →approx 43.9 *1e-68 =4.39e-67 J² s².

μ is 3.01e-27 kg.

R squared is (2e-10 m)^2=4e-20 m².

Denominator: 8 π² μ R² =8 * (pi^2) *3.01e-27 *4e-20.

Compute 8 * pi^2 =8 *9.8696≈78.957.

3.01e-27 *4e-20=1.204e-46.

Multiply by 78.957: 78.957 *1.204e-46 =95.15e-46 =9.515e-45.

So denominator is 9.515e-45.

B =4.39e-67 /9.515e-45 = (4.39 /9.515) *1e-22 → approx 0.461e-22 =4.61e-23 J.

So that's correct. So the energy is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but the options don't have anything close to 1e-30 N·s. Wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is not E/c, but another approach is needed. Or perhaps the question is considering the transition as a change in both rotational and vibrational states?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total energy difference. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the momentum of the photon in a different way.

Wait, the given options are in the range of 1e-27 to 2e-27 N·s, which suggests that the energy is on the order of 1e-19 to 3e-19 J, since E = p * c → p ≈ E / 3e8.

Wait, 1e-27 N·s *3e8 m/s =3e-19 J.

Hmm, but the rotational transition I calculated was 9e-23 J, which is much smaller. So why the discrepancy?

Ah! Maybe I made a mistake in the selection of the transition. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a vibrational transition because the rotational transition requires more than just J=0 to J=1. Maybe in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational and vibrational levels are considered together.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which might be a combination of J and v. But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibrational state, assuming that the photon's energy is approximately the vibrational frequency. Because 4e14 rad/s is given as w.

Wait, the problem says the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. So h w is the energy for the vibrational transition.

Wait, for the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1, the energy ΔE = h w.

So E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 J·s *4e14 rad/s=2.65e-19 J.

Then, the momentum p = E_photon / c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg·m/s =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options:

Option A:1.9e-28 → 1.9e-28.

Option D:1.4e-28.

But 8.83e-28 isn't an option exactly. The closest is option A, but it's about 1.9e-28.

Hmm, so why is my calculation giving 8.8e-28 when the option is about 1.9e-28?

Wait, perhaps the given w is the vibrational frequency, but the photon's frequency is different. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.

Wait, the given w is 4e14 rad/s. So h w is 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

So E_photon =2.65e-19 J.

p = E_photon /c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the energy levels as a combination of both rotational and vibrational.

Wait, but the question says that the molecule is in the fundamental state. So I think the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the transition is either to J=1 or v=1.

Wait, but the problem is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition requires the least energy? As I computed earlier, the rotational transition (J=0→ J=1) requires 9.2e-23 J, which is much less than the vibrational 2.65e-19 J.

So why isn't the photon's momentum matching any of the options?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy in terms of the rotational transition. Let me see.

Another approach: The photon's energy E must match the energy difference between the two states. So if the molecule transitions from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), the energy difference is 2B. So E_photon =2B.

Wait, but B is in Joules, so E_photon =2B=9.22e-23 J.

p= E_photon /c=9.22e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s →3.07e-31 N·s.

Still way smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition where both J and v change, but that's more complicated and probably requires more energy, so it's not the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition but the photon's energy is for the fundamental vibration, which is E= h w.

But earlier calculation gives p=8.83e-28 N·s, which is not an option.

Looking back at the options:

Option A:1.9e-28.

Option B:2.3e-27.

Option C:1.1e-27.

Option D:1.4e-28.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon for the rotational transition.

Wait, alternative approach: Perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next possible state, which could be a combination of J=1 and v=1, but that requires more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the vibrational transition but using the reduced mass in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the calculation was done incorrectly for B. Let me try computing B again.

Wait, B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

μ= (20 *2)/(20+2) amu → (40/22) amu → approx 1.818 amu.

1 amu =1.66e-27 kg, so μ=1.818 *1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * pi^2 * 3.01e-27 * (2e-10)^2 )

Compute denominator:

8 pi^2 ≈78.957.

3.01e-27 * (4e-20) =1.204e-46.

78.957 * 1.204e-46 ≈95.15e-46 →9.515e-45.

So B = (4.39e-67) /9.515e-45 ≈4.61e-23 J.

So 2B =9.22e-23 J.

E_photon =9.22e-23 J.

p =9.22e-23 /3e8 →3.07e-31 N·s.

But that's way smaller than any option. So I must be missing something.

Wait another thought: Maybe the question refers to the rigid rotor's rotational energy as the main model, and the vibrational part isn't being considered here. Because the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, but perhaps it's asking for the transition that involves both rotation and vibration? Or perhaps the photon's energy is related to the vibrational part.

Wait, but the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state. So to go to the next state, perhaps it's a vibrational transition. But that requires more energy. But the options don't match that either.

Wait, maybe the question is about the energy in terms of the photon's momentum, but using the angular frequency in a different way. Wait, the question gives the angular frequency w as 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² / (2 I)) J (J+1) = (h² /8 π² I) J (J+1) = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the photon's energy in terms of frequency. The photon's energy is E = h f, and its momentum p = h f /c = E / c.

So if the photon's frequency f corresponds to the rotational energy difference, then f_rot = (2B) / h.

So f_rot = (2 *4.61e-23 J) / (6.626e-34 J s) → (9.22e-23)/(6.626e-34) ≈1.39e11 Hz.

Then, the photon's momentum is p = h f/c = (6.626e-34 J s) * 1.39e11 Hz / (3e8 m/s) → (approx) 6.626e-34 *1.39e11 /3e8.

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *1.39e11 =9.22e-23.

Divide by 3e8: 9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s →3.07e-31 N·s.

Again, same result.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps I should think that the question is actually referring to a vibrational transition, but perhaps the model is different.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the molecule's vibration is modeled as a harmonic oscillator, and the rotational model is the rigid rotor. So the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational.

In that case, the next state after (v=0,J=0) is either (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). The one with lower energy would be (v=0,J=1), which has E=2B.

So the photon's energy is 2B. So p=2B/(c).

Wait, B is 4.61e-23 J, so 2B=9.22e-23 J.

Thus, p=9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 N·s.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is considering the rotational transition as the first possible, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition from J=0 to J=2, which would be higher energy. No, that would require more energy, so it's not the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first excited vibrational state, which is v=1.

But in that case, the photon's energy is h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly half of that. Hmm, why would that be?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the vibrational energy difference is (3/2 h w), but no, the harmonic oscillator's energy difference is h w per quantum.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy for the vibrational transition is (3/2 h w), but that's the zero point energy. No, the transition from v=0 to v=1 is just h w.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating h w. Let me check:

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E= h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Yes, correct.

So p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 N·s.

But none of the options match exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given options are using a different approach, perhaps the photon's energy is the same as the rotational transition. But even so, I don't see any option matching that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of wavenumbers and then convert to energy.

Wait, wavenumber (tilde{nu}) is w/(c). So in cm^-1 units.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers and then find the energy.

Wait, B in cm^-1 is (h c)/(8 π² μ R²).

Wait, if I compute B in cm^-1:

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

1 cm = 0.01 m.

So compute B_cm1 = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (8 π² μ R² *100 cm/m).

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, R is in meters:2e-10 m.

So R²=4e-20 m².

μ=3.01e-27 kg.

B_cm1 = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (8 * (pi)^2 *3.01e-27 *4e-20 *100 )

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

Denominator:8 *9.8696≈78.957.

3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46.

Multiply by 100 →1.204e-46 *100=1.204e-44.

So denominator ≈78.957 *1.204e-44 =95.15e-44 →9.515e-43.

So B_cm1 =1.9878e-25 /9.515e-43 ≈2.09e17 cm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply an extremely high frequency, which isn't matching anything.

Wait, perhaps that approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of frequency units.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = h c B_rot, where B_rot is the rotational constant in cm^-1.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for an alternative way.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the given options and see which one makes sense.

Option C:1.1e-27 N·s.

E_photon = p*c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which would correspond to a frequency of 3.3e-19 /6.626e-34 ≈5e14 Hz.

Hmm, which is close to the given w of 4e14 rad/s (which is about 2e14 Hz, since 1 rad/s is approx 1/(2pi) Hz. So 4e14 rad/s is about 6.37e13 Hz.

Wait, 5e14 Hz is higher than 6e13.

Hmm, not matching.

Option B:2.3e-27 N·s.

E_photon =2.3e-27 *3e8=6.9e-19 J.

h f=6.9e-19 → f=6.9e-19 /6.626e-34 ≈1.04e15 Hz.

Which is 1e15 Hz, or 3e15 rad/s (since rad/s = 2 pi * Hz). The given w is 4e14 rad/s, which would correspond to about 6.37e13 Hz. So this is higher.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think that the photon's energy is the vibrational energy, so E_photon=h w, and then compute p= h w /c.

So p= (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (2.65e-19 J) /3e8 m/s →8.83e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a fifth of that.

Hmm. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the given options are considering the photon's energy as (3/2) h w for some reason, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the vibrational ground state to the first excited rotational state, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is using the bond length in a different way. Oh, wait, R is 2 angstroms, which I converted to 2e-10 m. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute the moment of inertia I = μ R².

μ is 3.01e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I=3.01e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg m².

The rotational constant B is h/(8 pi² I).

So B =6.626e-34 / (8 pi² *1.204e-46)

Compute denominator:8 pi² ≈78.957.

78.957 *1.204e-46=95.15e-46 →9.515e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.515e-45 =6.96e9 rad/s.

Wait, that's the rotational constant B in terms of angular frequency. So for J=0→1, the energy difference is 2B=1.39e10 rad/s.

So the photon's frequency would be 1.39e10 rad/s.

Then, E_photon = h * (1.39e10) =6.626e-34 *1.39e10 =9.22e-24 J.

p= E_photon / c =9.22e-24 /3e8 =3.07e-32 N·s.

Even smaller, so not matching any options.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. I think I've correctly calculated that the rotational transition requires less energy, but the photon's momentum comes out to be much smaller than any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the rotational transition but the vibrational transition. So the momentum p is h w /c.

h w=6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (1.9e-28), but it's about half.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the vibrational energy. Wait, the energy for v=0→v=1 is h w, which is correct.

But maybe the model includes the zero-point energy, but the transition would still be h w.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the energy from rotation and vibration may add up, but that would require more energy, not less.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the Raman transition, which involves a change in rotational state. But that might not apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state regardless of energy, just the next possible state, but that would be the vibrational transition since it's a higher energy.

But the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy", implying the minimal energy transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state in the energy level sequence, considering both rotational and vibrational transitions. So the energy levels are ordered as:

- (v=0, J=0): E1

- (v=0, J=1): E2

- (v=1, J=0): E3

So E1 < E2 < E3, so the next state would be E2.

So the photon's energy is E2 - E1 =2B.

So, the same as before: 9.22e-23 J, but no option matches.

So perhaps the correct answer is not present in the options, but given the options, the closest is when the photon's energy is for the vibrational transition, leading to p=8.83e-28, but none match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me compute B again using the given values.

B = h/(8 pi^2 I), where I = μ R².

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

I=μ R²=3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.01e-27 *4e-20=1.204e-46 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34 / (8 pi^2 *1.204e-46) )

Compute denominator: 8 pi^2 ≈78.957.

78.957 *1.204e-46 =95.15e-46 →9.515e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.515e-45 ≈6.96e9 rad/s.

So 2B=1.39e10 rad/s.

So the energy is 2B=1.39e10 rad/s * h/(2 pi) ?

Wait, no, because E= ħ omega, where omega is in rad/s.

Wait, ħ= h/(2 pi).

So E= ħ * omega.

But omega here is 2B=1.39e10 rad/s.

So E= (6.626e-34 / 6.2832) ) *1.39e10.

Compute that: 6.626e-34 /6.2832≈1.054e-33 J·s.

Multiply by 1.39e10:1.054e-33 *1.39e10≈1.467e-23 J.

So E_photon=1.467e-23 J.

p= E_photon /c =1.467e-23 /3e8=4.89e-32 N·s. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up units for B. B is in rad/s, but the energy is E= ħ B J (J+1).

So for J=0→1, the energy is E= ħ B (2).

So E= (h/(2 pi)) * B *2.

So E= (h/(2 pi)) * (h/(8 pi² I)) ) *2.

Wait, that would be:

E= (h/(2 pi)) * (h/(8 pi² I)) * 2.

Which simplifies to (h²)/(8 pi^3 I) *2.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy is E= (h^2/(8 pi² I)) * J (J+1).

So for J=0→1, E= (h^2/(8 pi² I)) *2.

But I= μ R².

So E= (h^2/(8 pi² μ R² )) *2.

Which brings us back to 2B=9.22e-23 J.

So again, same result.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the given bond length to compute the frequency for a vibration, but I don't see a direct connection.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually considering the transition to a higher vibrational state, but using the rotational model's energy as well.

But I'm stuck. I think the correct answer based on the calculations is E_photon=9.22e-23 J, leading to p=3.07e-31 Ns, but this is not one of the options.

Another possibility: Maybe the question is asking for the photon's momentum that allows the molecule to switch to the next state, which could be a combination of changing J and v. But that would require a higher energy, which is not the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, which would have a larger energy, but again, not the minimal.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, maybe the question isn't about the fundamental state but the first excited state of vibration. No, the question clearly states the molecule is in the fundamental state.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the energy of the photon as the sum of the first vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would be even higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the vibrational transition, but with a factor. Let me see.

If I use option C:1.1e-27 N·s.

E_photon=1.1e-27 *3e8=3.3e-19 J.

Which would correspond to h w=3.3e-19 J.

So w=3.3e-19 /6.626e-34 ≈5e14 rad/s.

But the given w is 4e14 rad/s. So why would the photon's frequency be higher?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy, but I'm not seeing how.

Given that none of the options match my calculated values, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the problem is considering the photon's energy as being the vibrational energy, leading to E_photon= h w.

Then, p= h w /c = (6.626e-34 *4e14)/3e8=8.83e-28 Ns. But the closest option is A:1.9e-28, which is about a fifth.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recalculate using the reduced mass in a different way.

Wait, the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=1 to J=2, but that requires more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy for a change in both J and v, but that's getting complicated.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, I think the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns. Because when I computed E_photon for the vibrational transition, I got 8.83e-28, which is close to option A's 1.9e-28. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational constant.

Wait, another approach: B= h/(8 pi² I).

I=μ R²=3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.01e-27 *4e-20 =1.204e-46 kg m².

So B=6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² *1.204e-46).

Compute denominator:8 pi²≈78.957.

78.957 *1.204e-46=95.15e-46=9.515e-45.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.515e-45=6.96e9 rad/s.

So 2B=1.39e10 rad/s.

E_photon=h * (1.39e10) =6.626e-34 *1.39e10 =9.22e-24 J.

p=E_photon/c=9.22e-24/3e8=3.07e-32 N·s.

But again, none of the options match.

I think I've reached the limit of my understanding. Based on the calculations, the correct momentum should be around 3e-31 Ns, but since it's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns, corresponding to a vibrational transition, assuming I made a miscalculation in the rotational approach.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule is in its fundamental state (lowest vibrational state, \(v=0\), and lowest rotational state, \(J=0\)). The goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options provided suggest that the photon's momentum corresponds to either a rotational or vibrational transition.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Energy Levels and Transitions**:
   - The total energy of the molecule is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies:
     \[
     E = E_{\text{rot}} + E_{\text{vib}}
     \]
     where \(E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1)\) and \(E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + h \omega v\).
   - The fundamental state is \((v=0, J=0)\). The next state with the lowest energy could either be \((v=0, J=1)\) or \((v=1, J=0)\).

2. **Energy Differences**:
   - For the rotational transition \((J=0 \to J=1)\), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B
     \]
     where \(B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2}\).
   - For the vibrational transition \((v=0 \to v=1)\), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
     \]

3. **Calculations**:
   - The reduced mass \(\mu\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms:
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.01 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
   - The bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\).
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2}
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (3.01 \times 10^{-27}) (2 \times 10^{-10})^2}
     \]
     After computation:
     \[
     B \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Thus, the rotational energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
   - The vibrational energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
     \]

4. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The rotational transition requires less energy (\(9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)) than the vibrational transition (\(2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)). Therefore, the photon's energy should correspond to the rotational transition.

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The photon's momentum is related to its energy by:
     \[
     p = \frac{E}{c}
     \]
     For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
   - This value is much smaller than any of the provided options, suggesting a possible mismatch or misinterpretation of the problem.

6. **Vibrational Transition**:
   - If the photon's energy corresponds to the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
     This is closer to option A (\(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)) but still not an exact match.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the calculations, the rotational transition requires the smallest energy, but the computed momentum does not match any of the options. If the problem intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, the closest option is **C (\(1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s}\))**, though this is not a perfect match.

ANSWER: C
