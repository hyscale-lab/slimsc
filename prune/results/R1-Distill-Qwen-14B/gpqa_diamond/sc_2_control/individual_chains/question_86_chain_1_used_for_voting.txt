Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves two reactions where different reducing agents are used on two unknown compounds, A and B, to produce specific products. The products are enantiomers of each other, based on the (R) and (S) designations.

Hmm, the products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, those are diastereomers or enantiomers? Oh, wait, the configuration at the chiral center is opposite. So they're enantiomers. So the reaction must be leading to the formation of a chiral center, and the configuration depends on the starting material and the reagents used.

Wait, both reactions are reduction reactions. The first one uses LiBH4, and the second uses BH3. I know that both are borohydride reducing agents, but there's a difference in their reaction conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and usually works in protic solvents like methanol or ethanol. BH3, on the other hand, is typically used in less polar solvents, and it's a milder reducing agent. Oh wait, no, wait. I think BH3 is often used with THF as a solvent, and it can act as a selective reducing agent, maybe for ketones over esters or something like that. Or wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a good reducing agent for esters, but BH3 might not reduce esters. Wait, no, actually, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but BH3 is more selective. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, no, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is a ketone or an ester that forms this upon reduction.

Wait, but the products are 4-ethyl-... So the structure must have an ethyl group at the 4 position. Let me think about the formation of tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, right, like a cyclic ether, but with a ketone group. So maybe the starting material is an ester or a ketone that, upon reduction, forms this ring.

Wait, but wait, the product is a gamma-lactone? Or a cyclic ether with a ketone. Oh, wait, the product is a tetrahydro pyranone. So pyran is a six-membered ring with five carbons and one oxygen. So pyran-2-one would have the ketone at the 2 position.

So the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen, the ketone at position 2, and an ethyl group at position 4.

How is this formed via reduction? Let me think about the possible starting materials. Perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which upon reduction would open or form this structure. Or maybe it's a ketone that undergoes some kind of ring-forming reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha,beta-epoxy ketone or something similar. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something else.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reagents. Both reactions are using borohydrides but in different forms. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters, ketones, aldehydes. BH3, especially in a certain solvent, is more selective. Wait, another thought: BH3 is typically used in the reduction of ketones and aldehydes, but it may not reduce esters. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, but typically, esters are not reduced by BH3. So if the starting material is an ester, then LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol, but BH3 wouldn't. But in this case, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is a ketone.

Wait, no, the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (a lactone), which upon reduction would form a diol. Wait, but that would require breaking the ester. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent ester group. Or maybe it's a cyclic ketone with some substituents.

Wait, let me think differently. The product is (R) or (S) configuration at a specific carbon. The starting material's configuration would influence the product's configuration, depending on the reaction conditions.

Wait, the two reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. They produce enantiomers of each other. So, the stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting material and the reducing agent used. So perhaps the starting materials A and B have the same structure but different configurations, leading to different products when reduced with different reagents.

Wait, another thought: In the reduction of ketones, the stereochemistry of the product (if a new chiral center is formed) depends on the reducing agent. For example, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, using a specific borohydride can influence the configuration.

Wait, but wait. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but is also a bulky one? Or is it more about the solvent and reaction conditions affecting the approach of the hydride.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again about the problem.

The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the reactions are leading to the formation of a chiral center. So the starting material must have a certain configuration, and the reducing agent's method of attack (like hydride addition) determines the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a stereogenic center adjacent to it. When reduced, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, generating a new chiral center, whose configuration depends on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but in the product, the configuration is R or S. So the starting material must have a certain configuration that leads to one enantiomer when reduced with LiBH4 and the other when reduced with BH3.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different in their reducing power and steric effects. LiBH4 is less bulky than BH3? Or more? Wait, BH3 is a smaller molecule, but when it's used as a reducing agent, perhaps in THF, it's a more controlled environment.

Wait, another angle: In ketone reductions, when using a chiral starting material, the product's configuration can be influenced by the catalyst or the reducing agent's structure. But in this case, the reducing agents are not chiral, so the product's configuration would depend on the starting material's configuration and the direction of hydride attack.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a stereogenic center. When reduced, the ester becomes a diol, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone. Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Wait, looking back, the options given for A and B are (S) or (R) configurations of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, let me draw the structure of that compound. 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So:

Positions: 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5.

At position 3, there's an ethyl group. At position 5, there's an isobutoxy group and an oxo (keto) group. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, wait. Let me write it properly.

The formula is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH.

Numbering from the COOH end, position 1 is COOH, position 2 is CH2, position 3 is CH(CH2CH3) (since it's 3-ethyl), position 4 is CH2, position 5 is CO-O-isobutoxy.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, the formula would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-R?

Wait, no, wait, the 5 position is the last carbon (fifth from COOH). So:

The structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), where R is isobutoxy.

Wait, but wait, oxo group is a ketone, so perhaps it's:

The fifth carbon (the one next to COOH) has a ketone and an isobutoxy group attached. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-R), but wait, the fifth carbon is the one adjacent to the COOH, so perhaps it's:

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The molecule is a pentanoic acid with substituents on carbon 3 (ethyl) and on carbon 5 (isobutoxy and oxo).

Wait, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-C(CH2CH3)(CH2COO-iBu)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

The acid is pentanoic acid, with an ethyl group on carbon 3 and a group at carbon 5 which is isobutoxy and a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu ?

Wait, that can't be right because the oxo is a ketone, so it would be a carbonyl group.

Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the pentanoic acid is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, but wait, the oxo group is at position 5. So the fifth carbon (from the COOH end) has a ketone group. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu ?

Wait, but that would make it a pentanoate ester, but also having a ketone at position 5? That seems unlikely because the same carbon can't have both a ketone and an ester group. Oh wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure. Maybe it forms a lactone.

Wait, another approach: when a reducing agent is applied to a ketone, it reduces the ketone to an alcohol. But the product here is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, which upon reduction opens up to form a diol, but that doesn't fit the product.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions.

Reaction 1: A treated with LiBH4 and H+ gives (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Reaction 2: B treated with BH3 and H+ gives (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

So A and B are different, and their reaction with different reducing agents leads to enantiomers.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various reductions. For example, when a gamma-keto ester is reduced with a borohydride, it can form a diol, but that might not form a cyclic structure.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or a cyclic ether with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an adjacent ester group, which upon reduction forms the cyclic structure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that when reduced forms the pyranone structure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a substituent that, upon reduction, forms the ring. For example, a 5-membered lactone could reduce to a 6-membered ring. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. So, structure would be something like:

RCOCH2COOR'

Upon reduction, it could form an alcohol, but how would that form a cyclic structure?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, leading to a ring-opening and then a ring-closing.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the products. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure would be a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. The substituents are at position 4, an ethyl group.

So, the ring is:

O
||
C - C - C - C - C - C

Positions: 1 (O), 2 (ketone), 3,4 (ethyl), 5,6.

Wait, let me draw it properly.

The ring is a six-membered ring with an oxygen at position 1, a ketone at position 2. So the positions are 1 (O), 2 (CO), 3, 4 (ethyl), 5, 6.

Wait, perhaps the ring is formed by the reduction of a lactone. If the starting material is a gamma-lactone with substituents, then upon reduction, it forms a diol, but that's not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester substituent, which upon reduction forms the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Let's think: a beta-keto ester is R-CO-CO-O-R'. When reduced with a borohydride, perhaps it forms an alcohol, but I'm not sure how that would form a ring.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone group. For example, a six-membered lactone with a ketone at position 2.

Wait, but the product is a pyranone, which is a six-membered ring with one oxygen and a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester that forms the ring upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is something like:

O
||
C-O-C-O-R

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the reduction of an ester to form a ring.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, but that's usually formed from a diol and a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When reduced, the acetal opens, and the ketone is reduced to an alcohol. But that's probably not leading to a cyclic structure.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the possible reactions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters to alcohols. So if the starting material is an ester, LiBH4 would reduce it to a diol. But the product here is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reducing agent is causing a ring-opening, but then how would that form another ring?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group, and the reduction leads to the formation of the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol that cyclizes to form the pyranone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, where the ester is part of a chain that can cyclize after reduction.

For example, the starting material could be something like CH2-CO-CO-O-R. When reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, and the ester becomes an alcohol as well, leading to two adjacent alcohols. Then, perhaps, under acidic conditions, these could cyclize to form a ring with an ether linkage and a ketone.

Wait, that might make sense. So, reducing a gamma-keto ester would give a diol, which could then form a cyclic structure upon acid work-up.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: when a gamma-keto ester is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4 or BH3, the ketone is reduced, but the ester remains. Then, perhaps, the ester can undergo some kind of cyclization under acidic conditions.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester with an ethyl group in a specific configuration, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then forms a six-membered ring upon acid work-up.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. Let me think.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Structure would be:

RCOCH2COOR'

Upon reduction with a borohydride, the ketone (RCO-) would be reduced to RCH2-OH. The ester (COOR') would remain as COOR'. Then, in the presence of acid, perhaps the hydroxyl groups could undergo cyclization.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the reduction of the gamma-keto ester doesn't reduce the ester but only the ketone.

Wait, no. LiBH4 typically reduces esters as well. So if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, LiBH4 would reduce both the ketone and the ester to alcohols.

So, structure would be RCH2OH-CH2-COOH (if the ester is R' = H). Then, upon acid work-up, perhaps the diol could form a cyclic structure.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again. The options give specific structures for A and B, which are enantiomers.

Looking at the options:

Options A and B have both A and B being the same enantiomer, which can't be right because then the products would be the same. So the correct answer must be either C or D, where A and B are different enantiomers.

Because in the problem, the two reactions produce enantiomers, the starting materials must be enantiomers as well, since the reducing agents are different and they produce opposite configurations.

Wait, but wait. The starting materials are A and B, which when reduced with different reagents produce (R) and (S) products. So if A is R and B is S, then depending on the reaction, their configurations would lead to the opposite product.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the reduction process.

When you reduce a ketone, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, which is the electrophilic carbon. The configuration of the starting material's adjacent chiral center will influence the approach of the hydride, thus determining the configuration of the product.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone, and the reduction leads to a new chiral center in the product. So the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ester, and the reduction leads to a new chiral center in the product.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a chiral center. The reduction would convert the ester to an alcohol, but I'm not sure how that would form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a substituent that allows the formation of the product upon reduction.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction with LiBH4, which can open the ester ring to form a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could form a cyclic hemiacetal, leading to the pyranone structure.

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let's think about the specific options.

The options for A and B are both (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is a pentanoic acid with substituents. So it's:

Structure: 

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, but that can't be right. Because position 5 is the last carbon before the COOH, so the structure would be:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: C(O-O-iBu)

Wait, but position 5 would also have an oxo group, meaning it's a ketone. So perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)-CO ?

Wait, that's not possible because that would make the same carbon a ketone and an ester, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The acid is pentanoic acid. At position 3, there's an ethyl group. At position 5, there's an isobutoxy group and a ketone. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu.

Wait, but that would make the fifth carbon a ketone and an ester group. That's not possible because a single carbon can't have both a carbonyl and an ester group. So perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, but I can't see how that would fit. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a gamma-keto ester, where the gamma position is the 5th carbon.

Wait, let me try to draw it. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the pentanoic acid is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CH2 - COO-iBu.

Wait, but that would make the carbon adjacent to COOH (position 5) have both a COO-iBu and a COOH group, which doesn't make sense. So I must be misnumbering.

Wait, perhaps the correct numbering is from the other end. Let me think: the COOH is position 1, then the chain goes to position 5. So:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: C(O-O-iBu) = O

Wait, but that would give the structure:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu).

But then, the 5th carbon would have both a ketone (oxo) and an ester (O-iBu). Which is impossible because that would require two carbonyl groups on the same carbon.

Ah, I see. So that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the structure is:

The compound is a pentanoic acid with a substituent at position 5 that includes both the oxo group and the isobutoxy group. So, the 5th carbon is where both substituents are attached.

Wait, wait, the formula for 5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would be:

The pentanoic acid chain would have a substituent at position 5 which is both isobutoxy and oxo. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)=O.

Wait, but that would imply a cyclic structure, perhaps a lactone. Because it's pentanoic acid, so five carbons, and substituents at the fifth carbon.

So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-CO-O-iBu is attached to the fifth carbon, which is also attached to the fourth carbon.

Wait, but the fifth carbon has COOH on one end. So perhaps it's:

The molecule is a cyclic ester, but that would require the COOH and the COO-iBu to be connected. But I'm not visualizing it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring, but the question is about pentanoic acid, so that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The compound is a pentanoic acid with an ethyl group on the third carbon and a substituent on the fifth carbon which is both a ketone and an isobutoxy group. But that's impossible, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is on the same carbon as the oxo group. So the structure would be:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-iBu)- ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the substituent is on the fourth carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the same carbon. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the parent chain is pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents on carbons 3 and 5.

Carbon 3: ethyl group.

Carbon 5: isobutoxy and oxo groups.

So, the structure must be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-O-iBu)=O.

Wait, that can't be because it's the same carbon with two substituents: O-iBu and =O. So that's impossible, as a carbon can't have two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the oxo group is part of a carbonyl, and the isobutoxy is an ester group. So, the fifth carbon is a carbonyl carbon, connected to an oxygen that's connected to the isobutoxy group.

So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu.

But that's a pentanoate ester, with a substituent at position 5 as COO-iBu. Then, where is the oxo group? Oh, wait, perhaps the structure is:

The fifth carbon is the carbonyl carbon, so it's a ketone. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CO-O-iBu.

But then, the fifth carbon has a carbonyl group (COO-iBu), which is an ester, so it's not a ketone. So the oxo group must be somewhere else.

I'm getting stuck on the structure of the starting material. Maybe I should think about the possible reactions again.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the structure is a six-membered ring with an oxygen at position 1 and a ketone at position 2. Position 4 has an ethyl group.

So, the ring is O-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that upon reduction forms the pyranone. Or perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester that, upon reduction, forms the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that upon reduction forms the product.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the stereochemistry.

When a ketone is reduced to an alcohol, the configuration of the product depends on the approach of the hydride. If the starting material is a chiral ketone, the hydride can approach from either the Re or Si face, leading to the R or S configuration in the product.

So, perhaps the starting material is a chiral ketone, and the direction of reduction (LiBH4 vs BH3) affects the approach of the hydride, leading to opposite configurations.

Wait, but in this problem, the starting materials are the same, except for their configuration, and the reagents are different, leading to opposite configurations in the product.

Wait, no. Because the problem states that A and B are two unknown compounds treated with different reagents. So A and B could be enantiomers, and the reagents lead to opposite products.

But how would that work?

Suppose A is R and B is S. When treated with LiBH4, A gives R-product, and when treated with BH3, B gives S-product.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the reducing agent's approach is influenced by the starting material's configuration, leading to opposite products.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the examples. For example, in the reduction of (R)- and (S)-configured ketones, which reagent would lead to which product.

Wait, when using a bulky reducing agent, like LDA or something, it can lead to anti-Markovnikov addition. But LiBH4 and BH3 are not that bulky. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: in the reduction of an ester to an alcohol, the configuration at the adjacent chiral center determines the product's configuration. So, if the starting material is a chiral ester, the hydride would approach from a certain face, leading to a specific configuration in the product.

So, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when reduced with LiBH4, which can approach in a certain way, and with BH3, which approaches differently, leading to opposite configurations.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, which suggests that the starting material isn't an ester but a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with a substituent that allows the formation of the product upon reduction. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester that, upon reduction, forms the pyranone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction forms the product.

I think I'm stuck on the structure of the starting material. But looking at the options, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, with either R or S configuration.

So, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto acid. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu.

Wait, but that would make the fifth carbon a carbonyl group connected to the isobutoxy, making it an ester. So the structure would be a gamma-keto ester.

So, when reduced, the gamma-keto ester would form a diol. Then, under acidic conditions, the diol could form a cyclic structure.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone, which upon reduction would form a diol, and then under acidic conditions, the diol could cyclize to form the pyranone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a six-membered lactone with substituents, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then forms the pyranone upon acid work-up.

But the options given are for a pentanoic acid, not a six-membered lactone. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the pyranone.

Wait, let's think in steps:

1. Starting material: gamma-keto ester (RCOCH2COOR').

2. Reduction with LiBH4: reduces the ketone (RCO-) to RCH2-OH and the ester (COOR') to CH2OH.

3. Product after reduction: RCH2-OH-CH2-CH2-OH.

But wait, that's a diol. Under acidic conditions, the diol could lose water to form an ether linkage, creating a ring.

If the diol is 1,4-pentanediol, under acid, it could form a five-membered ring (like a hemiacetal), but the product is a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester with a longer chain, leading to a six-membered ring upon cyclization.

Wait, but the options are for a pentanoic acid, so perhaps the chain is five carbons long.

If the starting material is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-iBu.

Upon reduction with LiBH4, the ketone (CO-) would become CH2-OH, and the ester (CO-O-iBu) would become CH2-OH as well.

So, after reduction:

CH2(OH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-OH.

But wait, that's a 1,4-pentanediol with substituents. Then, under acidic conditions, perhaps the two OH groups would lose water to form a five-membered ring.

But the product is a six-membered ring. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a six-membered gamma-keto ester, but the options only have pentanoic acid. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another approach: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal, which suggests that the diol and a carbonyl are present in the same molecule, allowing cyclization.

So, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a diol adjacent to a carbonyl group, which can then cyclize.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester with a ketone substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, and the reduction doesn't change the ring but adds a substituent.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The options are either both (S), both (R), or a mix. Since the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must be enantiomers.

So, looking at the options:

Option D: A is (R), B is (S).

So, when A is (R) and reacts with LiBH4, it gives (R)-product. When B is (S) and reacts with BH3, it gives (S)-product.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material determines the product's configuration, and the choice of reducing agent affects the approach of the hydride.

Wait, but how?

In the reduction of a chiral ketone, the approach of the hydride from the less hindered face would determine the product's configuration.

So, if the starting material is (R), and the hydride approaches from the Re face, the product would be (S), or vice versa.

Wait, which reducing agent would lead to which approach? I think LiBH4 is more bulky than BH3, which might cause it to approach from the less hindered side.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agent's solvent affects the approach. For example, BH3 in THF is a more controlled environment, leading to a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with LiBH4 leads to inversion, while BH3 leads to retention.

Wait, but I don't think that's the case. I think the approach is more about the steric environment and the starting material's configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a specific configuration that, upon reduction, leads to a specific product configuration with each reagent.

Given that, perhaps the correct option is D, where A is (R) and B is (S).

Because when A, which is (R), is reduced with LiBH4, it gives (R)-product, and when B, which is (S), is reduced with BH3, it gives (S)-product.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite is true: (R) starting material gives (S) product with LiBH4, and (S) starting material gives (R) product with BH3.

But I'm not sure about the exact relationship.

Wait, considering that the product from A is (R), and from B is (S), the starting materials must be enantiomers because the reagents are different and the products are enantiomers.

So, if the starting materials are enantiomers, then the correct option is D or C.

Looking at the options:

Option C: A is (S), B is (R).

Option D: A is (R), B is (S).

So, if the product from A is (R), and A is (R), then the reaction must produce (R)-product from (R)-starting material. Similarly, B is (S) and produces (S)-product.

So the correct option would be D: A is (R), B is (S).

But how does the configuration of the starting material lead to the product's configuration?

In the reduction of a chiral ketone, the hydride approaches the less hindered face. If the starting material is (R), the hydride would approach from the opposite face, leading to (S) product. Or is it the same face?

Wait, perhaps the approach of the hydride is from the same face as the existing substituents, leading to retention of configuration.

Wait, I think I'm confusing this. Let me think of an example.

Suppose the starting material is (R)-configuration. The ketone is at position 2, and the adjacent chiral center is (R). When reduced, the hydride approaches from the Re or Si face, leading to the product's configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's more about the facial attack. If the starting material is (R), and the hydride attacks from the same face, the product would be (R). But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the approach of the hydride result in the product's configuration being opposite.

So, if the starting material is (R), and the hydride attacks from the opposite face, the product would be (S).

If that's the case, then:

A is (R), treated with LiBH4 → produces (S)-product.

But the product given for A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydride approaches from the same face, leading to the same configuration.

So, if the starting material is (R), the product would be (R). Therefore, the starting material A must be (R) to produce R-product, and B must be (S) to produce S-product.

So, in that case, the correct option is D.

Thus, the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3, are used to reduce two unknown compounds, A and B, producing enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The goal is to determine the correct starting materials A and B.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Products and Their Relationship**: The products are enantiomers, meaning they are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. This implies that the starting materials A and B must also be enantiomers, as the reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) produce opposite configurations.

2. **Reagents and Reaction Conditions**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that reduces ketones to alcohols. It is less selective and may approach the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered face.
   - **BH3**: A milder reducing agent, typically used in less polar solvents, and can influence the stereochemistry of the product differently compared to LiBH4.

3. **Starting Material Structure**:
   - The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. These are enantiomers, differing in the configuration of the chiral center at position 3.

4. **Stereochemical Outcome**:
   - The reduction of a chiral ketone by a borohydride reagent depends on the approach of the hydride ion. The configuration of the starting material and the steric environment determine the product's configuration.
   - If the starting material is (R), it produces the (R)-enantiomer of the product when reduced with LiBH4. Similarly, if the starting material is (S), it produces the (S)-enantiomer when reduced with BH3.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This cannot produce enantiomeric products, as both would yield the same configuration.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This is similarly invalid, as both would yield the same configuration.
   - **Option C**: A is (S), and B is (R). This would lead to the correct enantiomeric products, but the configurations of the starting materials do not align with the expected stereochemical outcome.
   - **Option D**: A is (R), and B is (S). This ensures that A reduces to (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one with LiBH4, and B reduces to (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one with BH3, matching the given products.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B, as they produce the enantiomeric products when reduced with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively.
