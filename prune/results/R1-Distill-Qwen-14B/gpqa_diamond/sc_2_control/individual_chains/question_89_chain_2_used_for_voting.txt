Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and see if I can figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on my adamantane structures, but I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, like a series of connected cyclohexane rings in a diamond shape. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions on the adamantane skeleton.

The first step is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides react with strong bases, it's usually an elimination reaction. I think this would form an alkene via an E2 mechanism. So the product 1 would likely be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but if you eliminate two bromides, you form a double bond. So, 1,3-dibromo would lose Br- and form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3, making 1,3-diacetylenic adamantane? No, wait, elimination from vicinal dihalides (like 1,2) would form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Oh, wait, maybe it's a 1,3-diene. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe it's more about the base causing dehydrohalogenation. So two elimination steps. Or perhaps it's a single elimination but in a ring structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing the bromides to form an oxide. Let me think. Heating with KOH would likely abstract a beta-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form an alkene between the two adjacent carbons. Wait, but 1 and 3 might not be adjacent. No, adamantane's structure: each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons. So 1 and 3 might be separated by one bridge. So perhaps elimination forms a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, but I'm not entirely sure about the structure.

The NMR spectrum of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where vinyl protons appear, maybe doublets or something else. Then 2.41-2.23 (10H) broad region, probably the bridgehead protons. And 1.94 (2H), maybe some other protons. The IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests an ester or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, no, aldehyde is higher, like around 2800 and 2720 for the stretch. Oh wait, 1720 is more likely an ester carbonyl or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroxyl group? No, hydroxyl in IR would be a broad peak around 3200-3600.

Wait, product 1 is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides are usually formed with peracids. Wait, but KOH could cause elimination to form an alkene or maybe an epoxide if another reagent is present, but KOH alone... Hmm. Alternatively, could it be a diol? No, diols would have OH stretches.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diene. But then the IR doesn't show a peak corresponding to a diene. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but that doesn't fit the IR. Let me think again. Wait, 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So elimination with KOH might not form an alkene. Maybe this is a Hofmann elimination scenario? No, Hofmann elimination usually forms amines, but in this case, we have Br.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic esters. Alternatively, maybe the base is causing the dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Oh wait, but that's not possible because in the starting material, the Br's are on bridgehead carbons. Elimination would form a double bond, not a ketone. Hmm, perhaps product 1 is not an alkene. Or maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a base like KOH, could it form a cyclopropane ring? No, that's more like a Simmons-Smith reaction with CH2I2 and Zn. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard reagent, but KOH is a strong base, not a Grignard reagent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol. If KOH is causing hydrolysis of the bromides. But 1,3-dibromides hydrolysis with KOH would typically form vicinal diols. But wait, 1,3-dibromides are not vicinal. Oh wait, perhaps it's a trans-diol. If the two Br atoms are on opposite sides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing elimination, leading to a conjugated diene. Wait, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. But I don't see how elimination would lead to that. Maybe it's a ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group formed via oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's upfield for vinyl protons, but maybe they're attached to a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe they're part of an epoxide, but I don't see a peak in the IR for an epoxide. Wait, epoxide ring-opening would not produce a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with adjacent protons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-adamantandione. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester. Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm-1 could be an ester. So maybe the base caused some kind of cyclization or ester formation. But how?

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double elimination. Each Br is eliminated as Br- and forms two double bonds, but that would require the starting material to have adjacent Br atoms. Wait, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent on adamantane. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but without an amine present, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the next steps. The product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, if product 1 is a ketone or an ester, maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a diene, heating with Al isopropoxide might cause some kind of Diels-Alder reaction, but without a dienophile, that's not likely. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation if product 1 is an alkyl halide. But product 1 was formed from elimination, so it's probably an alkene or something else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an enol ether or something similar. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Let me think again. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring? No, I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The IR of product 1 shows 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of an ester (O-C=O) stretch. So product 1 must be an ester. How could 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an ester? Maybe via an elimination followed by some kind of cyclization or oxidation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann condensation, but that requires an intramolecular ester. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoing a Dieckmann-like reaction? Or perhaps the base is causing a coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the bromides to form an oxide bridge. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could form a cyclic ether, like an epoxide. But wait, 1,3-dibromides are not next to each other, so forming an epoxide would require a four-membered ring? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming a diketone, but that would require the loss of Br and addition of O.

Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. Then, product 1 is 1,3-diene. But IR doesn't show a peak for that.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone with a conjugated double bond. But again, the IR at 1720 is more likely an ester.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl group. Wait, but that's more like what happens in the formation of ketones from vicinal dihalides. For example, 1,2-dibromoalkanes can form ketones when treated with a strong base via a double elimination. But in 1,3-dibromides, perhaps the elimination is not possible for a ketone. Or maybe it's possible if the structure allows.

Wait, let me think: in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. If each bridgehead has another substituent, perhaps elimination can form a ketone on each bridgehead. But I'm not sure how that would work. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a double bond, and then maybe further reaction leads to a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. But the IR doesn't show the typical epoxide C-O-C stretching around 1250-1050 cm-1, but maybe it's not the main peak. Alternatively, the 1720 cm-1 is something else.

Wait, perhaps the IR is indicating a carbonyl, so product 1 has a ketone or ester group. Let me think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, maybe as in a ketone's CH2CO structure. But then, what's the environment? If it's a ketone, the adjacent protons would be split into a certain pattern.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester group, with the OCO group attached to a CH2. So the 4.79 ppm could be the CH2 connected to the ester. Then, the rest of the NMR would be the bridgehead protons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an ester, such as adamantyl acetate or something similar. But how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I don't see how KOH would cause that.

Wait, another approach: think about the second reaction. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, used for Friedel-Crafts. So maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride or an alkyl halide, but in the first step, it's treated with KOH, which would not form an acyl chloride. Hmm.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, then Al isopropoxide might not do much. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and Al isopropoxide is causing some kind of cycloaddition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an alkene, and then in the second step, Al isopropoxide is used to induce some kind of dihydroxylation or another reaction. But I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and then Al isopropoxide is used for ring-opening. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the third step is ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond. Because ozone reacts with double bonds. So if product 2 has a double bond, and after ozonolysis, product 3 is formed.

So, putting it together: The first reaction forms product 1, which is then converted into product 2 that has a double bond, perhaps a more substituted or different one. Then, ozonolysis cleaves that double bond into carbonyl groups.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange.

So, let me try to outline the process:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + excess KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720, so likely an ester or ketone)
2. Product 1 heated with Al isopropoxide → product 2 (maybe a diene or an alkene)
3. Product 2 ozonolyzed → product 3 (which would be carbonyl-containing compounds)

Wait, but product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is used. So product 2 is an alkene or alkyne.

Wait, product 1 → product 2: If product 1 is an ester, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is causing some kind of elimination to form an alkene. Because Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, it can help in elimination reactions by polarizing the leaving group.

Alternatively, product 1 could be a diol. If product 1 is a diol, heating with Al isopropoxide might dehydrate it to form an alkene. That would make sense because diols can lose water to form alkenes under acidic conditions. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave the double bond. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups. For each double bond, the products would have carbonyls. For example, if the double bond is in a symmetrical position, ozonolysis would give two identical carbonyl compounds.

But I need to think about the structure of product 2. Let's say that product 1 is a diol (maybe 1,3-adamantanediol). Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide (which can act as a catalyst for dehydration), product 2 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or similar.

Wait, but product 1's IR is 1720, which doesn't fit an alcohol. So product 1 isn't a diol. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH could form an ester via a nucleophilic attack. Wait, but how? Maybe via a substitution reaction, but with two bromides, perhaps it's more likely an elimination.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a double elimination forming a ketone. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the IR of 1720. That's a strong peak, which is typical for an ester (around 1740 usually, but can vary), or maybe a ketone (around 1715 cm-1). So product 1 is an ester or a ketone.

If product 1 is a ketone, then heating with Al isopropoxide might not do much. However, if it's an ester, maybe Al isopropoxide could cause some kind of reaction, like saponification, but that usually requires more basic conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an allyl ester. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide might cause some rearrangement or elimination to form a more substituted alkene, such as via a Zaitsev elimination.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diester. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step, with KOH, isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, KOH is a strong base; substitution (SN2) is possible, but with bridgehead bromides, which are typically not good for SN2 because of poor leaving group accessibility.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but adamantane isn't aromatic. Hmm.

This is getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle. Let's think about product 3. After ozonolysis, product 3's NMR is in question. Ozonolysis of a double bond typically cleaves it into carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, possibly with some hydrogen groups attached.

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Deshielding occurs when the hydrogen is near electronegative atoms or groups. So it's probably near a carbonyl.

In the NMR, the most deshielded hydrogen would be a triplet, doublet, etc., depending on neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, let's think about a specific structure. Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say, 1,3-adamantadiene. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups. But adamantadiene is a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene can lead to the formation of two carbonyl groups, possibly with adjacent structures.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a mono-alkene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Let's say product 2 is 1,2-diamantadiene or something similar.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should think about what the coupling patterns would look like.

In the NMR of product 3, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl, perhaps as part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group attached to carbonyls on either side. Then, each H in the CH2 would have neighboring Hs.

Wait, another possibility: if the ozonolysis produces a diketone, the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls would be deshielded. For example, if each end of the former double bond is a carbonyl, the adjacent CH2 groups would have Hs that are deshielded.

The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring Hs. If each CH2 group is next to another CH2, each H would couple with two sets of Hs.

Wait, but ozonolysis typically cleaves the double bond and adds O groups. For example, if the double bond is in the middle of a chain, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl compounds. So, if product 2 has a structure like CH2-CH2 (as part of adamantane), ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, leading to something like (CH2)O.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a simple alkene, like cyclohexene. Ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups, but in adamantane, it's more complex.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H is likely near a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. If the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H on the CH2 would see two neighboring Hs on the same CH2 (geminal coupling, which is usually not observed in 1H NMR because they're equivalent and split into a quartet, but wait, in reality, geminal coupling is usually not observed because the protons are equivalent and split each other in a way that's averaged out, unless under specific conditions). Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, each H would couple with two neighboring Hs (from the adjacent CH2), leading to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to a CH group. For example, if the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CO-R, then the central CH2 would see neighboring CH2 groups on either side. Each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets (each H has two neighboring Hs on each side) or a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, if the H is adjacent to a CH group, like R-CO-CH2-CH(R')-CO-R, then the Hs on the CH2 would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that after ozonolysis, each carbonyl is at the end, and the remaining Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. So, each H on that CH2 would couple with two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal, but maybe not observed) and with any adjacent Hs from neighboring groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are in a vinyl group, but that's unlikely because ozonolysis would break the double bond.

Another angle: let's think about the possible splitting patterns in the options.

Option A: triplet. So each H has two neighboring Hs.

Option B: triplet of triplets. So each H has two sets of coupling, each with two Hs, leading to 3x3=9 peaks, but in reality it might be a triplet of triplets, which would appear as a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, the triplet of triplets would arise if a proton is split by two different sets of neighboring protons, each of which is a triplet. So, for example, if a proton is next to two different sets of two protons each. But I'm not entirely sure.

Option C: doublet of triplets. So each proton is split by another set of protons, perhaps two different coupling partners.

Option D: pentet, which would come from coupling with four equivalent protons, but that's less likely in this scenario.

The most deshielded H would likely be part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is between two carbonyls, each H would be split by the two adjacent Hs on the same CH2 (but these are geminal and may not split, unless in a specific situation). Alternatively, if the CH2 is adjacent to a CH group, each H would couple with the two Hs on that CH group.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that each end is a ketone, and the central part is a CH2 group. So, for example, O=C-R-CH2-CH2-R'-C=O.

In that case, the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two neighboring Hs (on their own CH2 and perhaps others). So each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same group and maybe others. Alternatively, if each CH2 is only adjacent to other CH2 groups, each H would couple with two Hs on the neighboring CH2, leading to a triplet. 

Wait, considering each CH2 group next to another CH2 group: each H on the first CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the next CH2. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. This would cause each H to split into a triplet (n+1, where n=2). So the coupling would be a triplet.

But wait, in reality, if each H is adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 (geminal) and two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (vicinal), the splitting could be more complex. But geminal coupling is usually not observed because the two Hs are equivalent and split each other into a quartet, but in practice, it's often not observed. So the main splitting comes from the vicinal Hs.

In that case, each H would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet, which is option A.

But wait, let me think again. If the CH2 is between two CH2 groups, each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighbors on each side, leading to a (n+1)(n+1) pattern, where each n=2. So each H would split into (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a triplet of triplets. So the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Hmm, so I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify:

If a proton is adjacent to two different sets of two equivalent protons (like two CH2 groups on either side), then the splitting would be the product of each coupling. So for each adjacent CH2 group, the proton is split into a triplet. Since these are two different couplings (each CH2 has a different J value), the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, resulting in 3 x 3 = 9 peaks. But wait, in reality, the two J values might be similar, so it could appear as a more complex multiplet.

Alternatively, if the two adjacent groups have the same coupling, it would result in a triplet of triplets, but perhaps it's observed as a more complex pattern.

Wait, but in the options, option B is triplet of triplets. So if the most deshielded H is in the middle of two CH2 groups, each with two Hs, it would split into a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. So the correct answer would be B.

But earlier I thought that geminal Hs don't split, so let's reconsider. If the H is on a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would be split into a triplet. But if the H is also adjacent to another H on the same CH2, would that cause splitting?

Geminal coupling (Jgem) is usually around 2-3 Hz and is often not observed because the two Hs are equivalent and split each other into a quartet, but in practice, it's not observed because the splitting is too small and the peaks overlap.

So, the main coupling comes from the adjacent CH2 group. Each H would be split into a triplet (n=2), so the coupling pattern is a triplet.

Wait, but if the Hs are on a CH2 group next to another CH2 group, each H would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2 and two Hs on their own CH2. But if the two Hs on their own CH2 are equivalent, they don't cause splitting. So the only splitting is from the adjacent CH2. Thus, each H would be a triplet.

So in that case, the coupling pattern would be a triplet, option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another way to think about it: If a CH2 group is between two other CH2 groups, the central CH2's Hs would each be next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs on each side. So each H would have four neighboring Hs? No, because each adjacent CH2 has two Hs. So each H on the central CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the left CH2 and the two Hs on the right CH2.

Wait, but each H is only next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would see two Hs on the left and two Hs on the right. So the splitting would be a triplet from the left and a triplet from the right. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets. Because each H is first split into a triplet by the left Hs, and each of those peaks is then split into a triplet by the right Hs. So the result is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm mixing up things. The splitting is sequential, so the first split is into a doublet (n=1) or triplet (n=2). Let me think in terms of each coupling:

Each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the left CH2 and two Hs on the right CH2. So the number of neighboring Hs is 2 (left) + 2 (right) =4 Hs. But in reality, the Hs on the left and right are on different groups, so the coupling constants may be different.

Wait, but each H on the central CH2 would be split by each of the four Hs. But each of those Hs is on a different carbon, so the coupling could be complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each H on the central CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the left and two on the right, but the coupling constants are the same for each pair. Then, the splitting would be (n_left + 1) * (n_right + 1) = (2+1)*(2+1)=9, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in reality, it's more common to see each H being split by each neighboring group. So if each adjacent CH2 has two Hs, and the coupling constants are similar, the splitting would be a triplet from the left and a triplet from the right, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Therefore, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Heating with KOH**  
   - The starting material, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, reacts with KOH at 240°C.  
   - KOH likely induces a double elimination, removing two bromine atoms and forming a conjugated diene (1,3-adamantadiene).  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This suggests that the product is not a simple diene but may involve further reaction or rearrangement to form a compound with a carbonyl group, such as an ester or ketone.  

2. **Reaction 2: Heating with Al isopropoxide**  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid.  
   - Al isopropoxide likely facilitates dehydration or rearrangement, forming product 2, which contains a double bond. This step likely converts product 1 into an alkene or alkyne.  

3. **Reaction 3: Ozonolysis**  
   - Product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by the addition of dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups. Thus, product 3 contains carbonyl groups at the sites of the original double bond in product 2.  

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group flanked by two carbonyl groups, the hydrogens on this CH₂ group will couple with the hydrogens on adjacent groups.  
   - Each hydrogen on the CH₂ group will be split by two hydrogens on one adjacent group and two hydrogens on the other, leading to a coupling pattern of a triplet of triplets.  

### Conclusion  
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.  

ANSWER: B
