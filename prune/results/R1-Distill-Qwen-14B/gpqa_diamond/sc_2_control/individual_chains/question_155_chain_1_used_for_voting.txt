Okay, so I'm trying to find the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩². So I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Since the state is given, I can compute the expectation values directly. I'll start with ⟨P_z⟩. 

The operator P_z is a diagonal matrix because its basis is the eigenvectors, so diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. From the given matrix of P_z, the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. So the operator matrix is:

[ ħ   0      0   ]
[ 0   0      0   ]
[ 0   0   -ħ ]

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. To find ⟨P_z⟩, I multiply ψ† (the conjugate transpose) by P_z and then by ψ.

So, ψ† P_z ψ = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2).

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/2)*(ħ)*( -1/2 ) = (1/4)*ħ
Second term: (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) = 0
Third term: (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2) = (-ħ/2)*(1/2) = ? Wait, wait. Wait, the third entry in ψ is -1/2. So the term is ( -1/2 ) * ( -ħ ) * ( -1/2 ) ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The operator P_z is diagonal, so when acting on ψ, each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So ψ† P_z ψ is the sum over each element multiplied by its eigenvalue.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^* ) * ( ħ ) * (-1/2) + ( (1/√2)^* ) * (0) * (1/√2) ) + ( (-1/2)^* ) * ( -ħ ) * (-1/2).

Wait, since all the elements are real, the conjugate doesn't matter. 

So:

Term 1: (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ
Term 2: (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Term 3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2)*( -ħ ) * (-1/2 ) 

Wait, let me compute term 3 step by step. 

Term3: (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (-1/2) * [ (-ħ) * (-1/2) ] → No, wait, the operator is diagonal, so each component ψ_i is multiplied by the eigenvalue P_z^ii.

So the third component is ψ3 = -1/2. The eigenvalue for that component is -ħ. 

So term3 is ψ3^* * (P_z^33) * ψ3.

So that's (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = (1/2) * (ħ/2) ?

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

ψ3 is -1/2.

P_z^33 is -ħ.

So term3 is (-1/2) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) = [ (-1/2) * (-1/2) ] * (-ħ) ) = (1/4) * (-ħ) ) = -ħ/4.

So adding all the terms:

Term1: (1/4) ħ

Term2: 0

Term3: - (1/4) ħ

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4) ħ - (1/4) ħ = 0. That's interesting.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal with each element squared. So P_z² has diagonal entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2.

So P_z² is:

[ ħ²  0     0 ]
[ 0   0     0 ]
[ 0   0   ħ² ]

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of (each ψ_i * (P_z^ii)^2 * ψ_i^* )

Again, since all ψ_i are real:

= ( (-1/2) )^2 * ħ² + (1/√2)^2 * 0 + ( (-1/2) )^2 * ħ².

So each term:

Term1: (1/4) * ħ²

Term2: (1/2) * 0 = 0 

Term3: (1/4) * ħ²

Total ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (1/2) ħ² - 0 = (1/2) ħ².

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the variance: sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be B.

To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The operator $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$. The given state is:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* P_z^{ii} \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:
- First term: $(-1/2) \cdot \hbar \cdot (-1/2) = \hbar/4$,
- Second term: $(1/\sqrt{2}) \cdot 0 \cdot (1/\sqrt{2}) = 0$,
- Third term: $(-1/2) \cdot (-\hbar) \cdot (-1/2) = -\hbar/4$.

Adding these terms:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \hbar/4 + 0 - \hbar/4 = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is also diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \sum_{i} \psi_i^* (P_z^{ii})^2 \psi_i.
\]

Substituting the values:
- First term: $(-1/2)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \hbar^2/4$,
- Second term: $(1/\sqrt{2})^2 \cdot 0 = 0$,
- Third term: $(-1/2)^2 \cdot \hbar^2 = \hbar^2/4$.

Adding these terms:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2/4 + 0 + \hbar^2/4 = \hbar^2/2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\text{Var}(P_z) = \langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \hbar^2/2 - 0 = \hbar^2/2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\text{Var}(P_z)} = \sqrt{\hbar^2/2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$.
