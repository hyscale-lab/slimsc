Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. It's about a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom and angles alpha, beta, gamma all equal to 30 degrees. They're asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The options are A to D, but I need to calculate it myself.

Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance in crystals is given by a formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh wait, the formula is something like d = a / sqrt( l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ ), right? Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I think the general formula for a rhombohedral system (which is a special case of hexagonal, but wait no, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system with all sides equal and angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the lattice is rhombohedral, meaning a=b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Wait, no, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal? Or is it a cubic system? Wait, no. Cubic systems have all sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. Rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal system? Or is it a different category? Maybe I should just get back to the formula.

The interplanar spacing formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, angles alpha, beta, gamma, and Miller indices (hkl) is d_hkl = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos beta - 2kl cos alpha ). Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Wait, no, in a general crystal system, the formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2 hl cos beta/(a c) - 2 kl cos alpha/(b c) ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma, so the formula simplifies. Let me think, if a=b=c, then the formula becomes d^(-2) = h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos gamma - 2kl cos gamma, divided by a².

Wait, that's because each term with a, b, c becomes 1/a², and since a=b=c, those terms are the same.

So for the (111) plane, h=1, k=1, l=1.

Putting these into the formula:

d^(-2) = (1² + 1² + 1²) / a² - 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos 30) / a²

Because each cross term would be, for example, 2hk cos gamma / (a²) but since a=b=c, each cross term is 2hk cos gamma / a², etc.

Wait, so the general formula is:

d^2 = a^2 / [ h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ]

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me make it clear. The general formula for d is:

d = (1/ sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - 2*(hk cos gamma)/(a b) - 2*(hl cos beta)/(a c) - 2*(kl cos alpha)/(b c) )) )

But in rhombohedral, a=b=c=a0, and all angles alpha=beta=gamma=theta (30 degrees here). So substituting those in:

d^(-2) = (h² + k² + l²)/(a0^2) - 2 (hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta )/(a0^2 )

Which can be written as:

d^(-2) = [ h² + k² + l² - 2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl) ] / a0^2

So d = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl ) )

So for (111) plane, h=k=l=1.

So substitute h, k, l as 1:

d^(-2) numerator becomes 1 + 1 + 1 - 2 cos(theta)(1*1 +1*1 +1*1 )

So that is 3 - 2 cos(theta) * 3 = 3(1 - 2 cos(theta) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute step by step.

h² + k² + l² = 1 +1 +1=3.

The cross terms: 2 cos(theta) (hk + hl + kl) = 2 cos(theta) (1*1 +1*1 +1*1 ) = 2 cos(theta) *3 =6 cos(theta)

So the numerator in the square root is 3 - 6 cos(theta).

Wait, no because the formula is (h² +k² + l² ) - 2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl )

So that becomes 3 - 6 cos(theta) = 3(1 - 2 cos theta )

So:

d = a0 / sqrt( 3 (1 - 2 cos theta ) )

Now, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance isn't the same as the lattice parameter. Hmm, I might have gotten confused here. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter is the interatomic distance. But what about rhombohedral?

Wait, wait, in a rhombohedral system with a=b=c, it's a cubic system but with angles not 90 degrees. So the interatomic distance (say, between nearest neighbors) may not be the same as a. Because in a cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a√(something) depending on the structure (like for a face-centered cubic, it's a√2 etc). But in a simple cubic, it's just a. But in this case, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom? Or is the interatomic distance different?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The interatomic distance is the distance between the nearest atoms. In a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, since each atom is at a corner of the cube, so the edge is the nearest neighbor. So in that case, the interatomic distance is a.

In a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbors are along the edges as well, so the interatomic distance is a, same as simple cubic. So if the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, then a is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, wait. No. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice is a cubic structure with all sides equal and angles not 90 degrees. So the nearest neighbor distance, which is the edge length of the lattice, is a. So yes, in this case, a is 10 Angstrom.

So a =10 Angstrom.

So plugging back into the formula, theta is 30 degrees.

So cos(theta) = cos 30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator:

sqrt(3 (1 - 2 cos(theta)) )

First compute 2 cos(theta) = 2 * 0.8660 ≈1.732.

1 - 1.732 = -0.732.

Wait, that would make the denominator sqrt( 3*(-0.732) ) which is sqrt of a negative number. That's impossible. Oh wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in my formula.

Wait, hold on. Let me check my formula again. Because I can't have a negative inside the square root. That suggests an error in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar spacing is d = [ (h² a² + k² b² + l² c²) - 2 h k a b cos gamma - 2 h l a c cos beta - 2 k l b c cos alpha ) ]^(-1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = [ (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2 hl cos beta/(a c) - 2 kl cos alpha/(b c) ]^(-1/2)

Hmm, but in the rhombohedral case, a=b=c and angles are equal. So substituting a=b=c = a0.

Then the formula becomes:

d^(-2) = (h² + k² + l²)/(a0^2) - 2(hk cos theta + hl cos theta + kl cos theta)/(a0^2 )

Which can be written as:

d^(-2) = [ h² +k² +l² - 2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl) ] / (a0^2 )

So then d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 cos theta (hk + hl + kl) )

Wait, so for (111), the numerator inside the square root is 3 - 2 * cos(theta) * (3) because 1+1+1=3.

So 3 - 6 cos(theta) .

But wait, if theta is 30 degrees, cos(theta) is about 0.866, so 6*0.866 =5.196.

3 -5.196= -2.196. Oh wait, that's negative again! So the square root of a negative is impossible. That can't be right.

So I must have the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the angle definitions wrong.

Wait, perhaps in some sources, the formula uses the angle between the crystallographic axes, which in rhombohedral is gamma, but maybe I got the angles wrong.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the three vectors are at the same angle to each other. So perhaps the formula is actually:

d = [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - (h k + h l + k l) (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) + ... ] No, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the correct formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, since I can't look it up, perhaps I should think of it another way. Let me think about the unit cell and the vectors. The general formula for a hexagonal crystal is different, but rhombohedral is a subset.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(h k + h l + k l) cos(theta) + 2 h k l (cos^2(theta) - 1) ) )

Wait, no, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is:

d^2 = (a^2)(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 a^2 (h k + h l + k l) cos(theta) + 2 a^2 h k l ( 1 - cos^2(theta) ) ) ) 

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (h k + h l + k l) cos(theta) + 2 h k l cos(theta) )

Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the Miller indices (h k l) and the angles in terms of the dot product.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the interplanar spacing using the structure factor approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal lattice vectors.

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (2pi/a)(1, 0, 0) + corrections from the other terms.

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Let me try a different approach.

In a rhombohedral system, the lattice is given by three vectors a, b, c, which are all equal in length and have the same angles between them. So, all edges are of length a, and the angles between each pair are theta (30 degrees here).

So, the metric tensor for this system is:

g_11 = a^2

g_22 = a^2

g_33 = a^2

g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = a^2 cos(theta)

The reciprocal metric tensor (g^ij) is needed for calculating the interplanar distances. The interplanar distance d_hkl is given by:

d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 g_11 + k^2 g_22 + l^2 g_33 - 2 h k g_12 - 2 h l g_13 - 2 k l g_23 ) / (g_11 g_22 g_33) ) )

Wait, let me get that correctly. The denominator for the reciprocal metric is the determinant of g, which for a cubic system is a^6, but in this case, since it's rhombohedral, it's a^6 multiplied by something. Wait, the determinant of g is:

g = a^2 (a^2 (a^2 - (a^2 cos(theta))^3 ) ? Wait, perhaps I should compute g more carefully.

The metric tensor g is diagonal except for the off-diagonal terms:

g = [
 [a², a² cos(theta), a² cos(theta)],
 [a² cos(theta), a², a² cos(theta)],
 [a² cos(theta), a² cos(theta), a²]
]

Hmm, calculating the determinant of this matrix would be a bit involved. Let me denote cos(theta) as c for simplicity.

So g is:

[ a², a² c, a² c ]

[ a² c, a², a² c ]

[ a² c, a² c, a² ]

The determinant of g can be computed using expansion by minors or other methods. Let me think of it as a 3x3 matrix. The determinant would be:

a^6 [ (1)(1)(1) + ... ] Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor out a² from each row. Each row has a², so the determinant is (a²)^3 times the determinant of the matrix:

[1, c, c]
[c, 1, c]
[c, c, 1]

So the determinant of g is a^6 times the determinant of the 3x3 matrix of 1s and cs.

Calculating that determinant: The matrix is:

1 c c

c 1 c

c c 1

The determinant can be calculated as:

1*(1*1 - c*c) - c*(c*1 - c*c) + c*(c^2 - 1*c )

Which is 1*(1 - c²) - c (c - c²) + c (c² - c )

Simplify each term:

First term: 1 - c².

Second term: -c (c - c²) = -c² + c^3.

Third term: c (c² - c ) = c^3 - c².

So adding all terms:

(1 - c²) + (-c² + c^3) + (c^3 - c²) 

= 1 - c² - c² + c^3 + c^3 - c²

= 1 - 3 c² + 2 c^3.

So the determinant of the small matrix is 1 -3 c² + 2 c^3.

So determinant of g is a^6 (1 -3 c² + 2 c^3).

So the reciprocal metric tensor g^ij is the inverse of g.

Hmm, but perhaps I don't need the full reciprocal metric tensor. The interplanar distance is given by:

d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 hk cos(theta) - 2 hl cos(theta) - 2 kl cos(theta) ) ) * sqrt( determinant(g) )

Wait, no, another approach. The formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h g11 + k g22 + l g33) ) 

Wait, no, perhaps not. I think the correct formula for the reciprocal space is:

The interplanar spacing is given by d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (hk cos(theta) + hl cos(theta) + kl cos(theta)) )

But wait, earlier I arrived at a negative number, which can't be correct. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the distance between lattice planes in a rhombohedral system. Another approach is to think of the planes and vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system, which is:

d^2 = [ (1/a^2) (h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2 hk cos(theta) - 2 hl cos(theta) - 2 kl cos(theta)) ]^{-1}

Wait, that seems similar to the earlier formula, but perhaps the denominator is different.

Wait, let's compute with that formula.

a is 10 Angstrom, theta is 30 degrees, so cos(theta)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660.

For (111):

h=1, k=1, l=1.

So numerator inside the brackets:

h² +k² + l² =3.

The cross terms: hk=1, hl=1, kl=1.

So:

h² +k² +l² - 2 hk cos(theta) - 2 hl cos(theta) - 2 kl cos(theta)
= 3 - 2 * [1 +1 +1 ] cos(theta)
= 3 - 6 cos(theta)
= 3 - 6*(0.8660)
=3 -5.196= -2.196

Which is negative. That can't be, so it's impossible. Therefore, my formula must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is actually:

d^2 = (a²) [ h² +k² + l² - 2 hk cos(theta) - 2 hl cos(theta) + 2 kl cos(theta) ) ]^{-1}

Wait, no, that would change the sign. But that's just a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the angles wrong. Maybe in the formula, the angles are the angles between the axes, which for rhombohedral is 180 - 30 = 150 degrees? Because sometimes crystal angles are taken as the angles between the vectors when building the lattice, which could be the supplementary angle.

Ah, that might be the mistake. Because in the metric tensor, the angle used is the angle between the lattice vectors. So if the given angles are 30 degrees, perhaps the angle between the vectors is 180 -30=150 degrees. Because in the crystal structure, the vectors are oriented such that the angle between them is the internal angle of the lattice.

Wait, that makes sense. Because in a rhombohedral system, the angle between the vectors is often considered as the angle needed to form the lattice, which is obtuse if theta is given as acute in the problem. For example, in a diamond structure, the angle between the vectors is 109.5 degrees, which is obtuse.

So perhaps the correct angle to use in the formula is 180-30=150 degrees, which has a cosine of cos(150)= -sqrt(3)/2 ≈ -0.866.

So let's recalculate with theta=150 degrees, cos(theta)= -0.866.

So back to the formula:

d^(-2) = (h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos(theta) - 2hl cos(theta) - 2 kl cos(theta) ) / a²

But wait, in this case, since a is 10 Angstrom.

So for (111):

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Compute the numerator:

3 - 2*(1+1+1) * (-0.866)

=3 - 2*3*(-0.866)
=3 + 6*0.866
=3 +5.196=8.196.

So denominator is 8.196, so d^2 = a^2 /8.196.

Wait, no, because the formula is d = a / sqrt( [h² +k² + l² - 2 hk cos(theta) - 2 hl cos(theta) - 2 kl cos(theta) ] )

Wait, no: the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2 hk cos(alpha) - 2 hl cos(beta) - 2 kl cos(gamma) )

But in rhombohedral, all angles are theta=150 degrees, so:

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2*3*(-0.866) )

Wait, let me compute inside the square root:

3 - 2*(1*1*(-0.866) + 1*1*(-0.866) + 1*1*(-0.866) )

Which is 3 - 2*( -0.866*3 )

=3 - (-5.196 )

=3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196 )

Compute sqrt(8.196 ). Let's calculate that.

sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d≈10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.49 Angstrom.

Wait, but the options are around 8-10 Angstrom. That can't be right. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I swapped the angle. Because the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors, which is 150 degrees, but perhaps the formula is designed for a hexagonal system, which has a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the interatomic distance differently. Wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the nearest-neighbor distance is a√(1 + 2 cos theta ), where theta is the angle between the vectors. Wait, but no, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the Bragg equation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the lattice, not the lattice parameter. So for a rhombohedral lattice, the nearest neighbor distance is a, just like in a simple cubic structure. Because each atom is at the corners of a cube.

Wait, no. In a cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so the distance is a. In a rhombohedral structure, which is a cubic structure but with angles not 90 degrees, the distance between nearest atoms is a. So yes, the lattice parameter a is the nearest neighbor distance, which is given as 10 Angstrom.

So a=10.

So the formula for d is 10 / sqrt( 3 - 6 cos(theta) )

Wait, but with theta=150, cos(theta)= -0.866, so 3 -6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196. So sqrt(8.196)=2.863, so d=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options are in the 8-10 range. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the crystallographic axes, which are the angles of the unit cell. So in that case, perhaps I should use the given 30 degrees as the angle between the vectors, not 150. But that gives a negative inside the square root, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute using the given 30 degrees.

Wait, let's try again with theta=30 degrees.

Compute the denominator inside the square root:

3 -6*(0.866) =3 -5.196 = -2.196. Which is negative. So that can't be.

So if that's the case, perhaps the formula is wrong, or perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't a but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different direction. For example, in a simple cubic lattice, the interatomic distance is a. But in a rhombohedral lattice, perhaps the interatomic distance is along a different vector, not along the cube edge.

Hmm, maybe the interatomic distance isn't a, but a times something.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance is a * sqrt( 1 + 2 cos(theta) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the distance is a * ( sqrt( ... )).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the interatomic distance as the edge of the rhombohedron, which is given as 10 Angstrom. So a=10.

But then the formula gives a negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the (111) plane doesn't exist in this structure. But that's not the case, as the question asks it.

Wait, maybe I've got the formula wrong. Let me try to find another approach.

I recall that in a hexagonal crystal system, the interplanar spacing for the (hkl) plane is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk - hl - kl )

But wait, that's for hexagonal systems with c/a = ... something. Not sure if it's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the hexagonal and rhombohedral systems. Wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system? Or is it a type of cubic? No, rhombohedral is a subclass of hexagonal? Or is it cubic?

Wait, according to what I remember, cubic systems have all a, b, c equal and all angles 90 degrees. Rhombohedral has a = b = c, but angles are not 90. So it's a cubic system with non-orthogonal angles.

So perhaps the formula I should use is the general cubic formula.

The general formula for d in a cubic system (a = b = c) is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos(alpha) - 2 hl cos(beta) - 2 kl cos(gamma) )

But since in rhombohedral, alpha = beta = gamma = theta (30 degrees), this becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 hk cos(theta) - 2 hl cos(theta) - 2 kl cos(theta) )

= a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 cos(theta) (hk + hl + kl) )

So for (111):

d = a / sqrt(3 - 2 cos(theta) *3 )

= a / sqrt(3 (1 - 2 cos(theta) ) )

Now, if theta is 30 degrees, cos(theta)=0.866.

So 1 - 2 *0.866= 1 -1.732= -0.732.

Which makes the denominator sqrt(3*(-0.732))= sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. So that's impossible.

Thus, the only possibility is that theta is 150 degrees, because cos(150)= -0.866.

Then, 1 - 2*(-0.866)=1 +1.732=2.732.

So:

d = a / sqrt( 3 * 2.732 )

=10 / sqrt(8.196)

Which is about 10 / 2.863 ≈3.49 Angstrom.

But the options are all above 8 Angstrom. So perhaps the formula is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the interatomic distance isn't a, but something else. Maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms in the basis, not the lattice parameter.

Wait, but the problem says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom", which is probably the distance between nearest atoms. In a simple cubic structure, this is a. So in this case, a is 10 Angstrom.

But according to the formula, the plane (111) has a d-spacing of about 3.49 Angstrom, which isn't among the options.

So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the hexagonal system, not rhombohedral. Because in hexagonal, the (111) plane might have a different formula. Let me think about that.

In hexagonal systems, the formula for d-spacing is:

d^2 = (4/3) ( a² (h² +k² + hk ) ) / ( (h² +k² + l² ) - hk - hl - kl )

Wait, I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for hexagonal is:

d = a / sqrt( (4/3)(h² +k² - hk ) + l² )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given system is a hexagonal system with a rhombohedral structure, and the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I've confused the definitions. But regardless, let me try to think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is for the atomic distance, and I need to adjust it accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the structure factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the interplanar spacing in rhombohedral is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) + 2 h k l (1 - cos(theta)) ) )

Wait, let me compute that.

With theta=150 degrees, cos(theta)= -0.866.

Compute the denominator:

3 - 2*(3)*(-0.866) + 2*(1)(1)(1) (1 - (-0.866) )

=3 +5.196 + 2*(1.866)

=3 +5.196 +3.732=11.928

So denominator is sqrt(11.928)≈3.454.

So d=10 /3.454≈2.896 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let's think differently.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't a, but the distance between two adjacent atoms along a different direction. For example, in a face-centered cubic, the nearest neighbor is along the cube diagonal, which is a√3/2.

Wait, but in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, which is a type of cubic. So perhaps the nearest neighbor distance is a√(some function of theta).

Wait, but in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor is along the edge, so a. But in a rhombohedral structure, atoms are at the corners of a rhombohedron. So the nearest neighbor distance would be a, because the rhombohedron edge is the shortest distance between atoms.

Wait, but even so, the formula gives a negative, which suggests I'm using the wrong angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are 30 degrees, but in the formula, I should use the angle between the reciprocal lattice vectors. Hmm, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2)(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) / ( 1 - 2 cos(alpha) + cos^2(alpha) )

But that seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2 ) + 2(hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos(theta)) )

Wait, with theta=30 degrees, cos(theta)=0.866, so 1 - cos(theta)=0.134.

So for (111):

h=k=l=1.

The denominator:

3 + 2*(3)*(0.134)=3 + 2*0.402=3+0.804=3.804.

So d=10 / sqrt(3.804)≈10/1.95≈5.128 Angstrom. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing.

Wait, the options are around 9 Angstrom. So 10 is the interatomic distance. So perhaps the interplanar distance is larger than a, which would make sense for (111) plane, which is a closer spacing.

Wait, but wait, the interplanar distance for (100) plane in simple cubic is a, which is 10. So perhaps for (111), it's smaller than a, but the options are larger than a. So that's conflicting.

Wait, the options are A)9.08, B)8.95, C)9.54, D)10.05. So they are all around 9 Angstrom.

If a=10, the interplanar distance of (100) is 10, and (111) is smaller, but the options are higher. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ) ?

Which for (111) would be 10 / sqrt(3)≈5.77 Angstrom. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) / (something). Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the units. Oh wait, the problem says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, the interatomic distance isn't a, but perhaps a function of a and angles.

Wait, the distance between two nearest atoms in a rhombohedral lattice is a, because in a simple cubic structure, nearest neighbor is along the edge. But since the angles are 30 degrees, perhaps the actual nearest neighbor distance is a, but the lattice parameter is different.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider that the interatomic distance is a, so a=10. So the formula I used gives d≈3.49, but that's not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar distance in a cubic system, ignoring the angles. So for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ).

For (111), that gives 10/sqrt(3)=5.77 Angstrom. Also not in the options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the planar distance in a hexagonal close-packed structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach using vectors.

The interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral lattice can be found using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2 hk cos(alpha) - 2 hl cos(beta) - 2 kl cos(gamma) )

Given that alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So the denominator is:

3 - 2*(1*1 cos(30) + 1*1 cos(30) + 1*1 cos(30) )

=3 - 2*(3 * 0.866)

=3 - 2*(2.598)

=3 -5.196= -2.196.

Negative again. So that's impossible.

So perhaps the given angles are 180-30=150 degrees.

So cos(alpha)=cos(150)= -0.866.

Denominator becomes:

3 -2*(3*(-0.866))=3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10 / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstrom.

But again, the options are higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is incorrect and I should use another approach.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem is not about the d-spacing but about the interplanar distance along a different direction.

Wait, but the question clearly asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo in the angles, but I can't do anything about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is actually d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl ) ), but that's not likely.

Wait, let me try plugging in the options to see what makes sense.

Option C is 9.54 Angstrom.

If d=9.54, then:

d^(-2) = (1/a^2) [ 3 -6 cos(theta) ]

So 1/(9.54)^2 = 1/(10^2) [3 -6 cos(theta) ]

Compute left side: 1/(90.  9.54^2 is approx 90.  So 1/90 = [3 -6 cos(theta) ]/(100 )

So [3-6 cos(theta) ]= (100/90) = 10/9 ≈1.111.

So 3-6 cos(theta) =1.111 → subtract 3 from both sides:

-6 cos(theta)= -1.889 → cos(theta)= (-1.889)/(-6)= 0.315.

Theta=acos(0.315)=71.5 degrees.

But the given angles are 30 degrees, so this doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (1 - cos(theta)) )

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

Denominator= 3 + 2*(3)(1 - cos(theta)).

So:

d=10 / sqrt(3 + 6*(1 - cos(theta)) )

If theta=30, cos(theta)=0.866.

Denominator=3 +6*(0.134)=3+0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=approx 1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.128. Not matching the options.

Alternatively, if theta=150, cos(theta)= -0.866.

Denominator=3 +6*(1 - (-0.866))=3 +6*(1.866)=3+11.196=14.196.

sqrt(14.196)=3.77.

d=10/3.77≈2.652. Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula with theta=150 degrees, leading to d≈3.49 Angstrom. But since none of the options match, perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't a, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between the atoms in the basis, not the lattice parameter. Suppose the basis has two atoms, and their distance is 10 Angstrom. Then, a would be something else.

But without knowing the basis, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is the nearest neighbor distance in the crystal, which could be along a different direction.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the (111) plane's interplanar distance is a / sqrt(3), but with a being 10, that's about 5.773. Not in the options.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the interplanar distance formula for a hexagonal system. The formula is:

d = 2a / sqrt( 4h² +4k² + 2 h k + 3 l² )

Wait, no, that's not right. The formula for hexagonal is more complicated.

Wait, the correct formula for interplanar spacing in a hexagonal system is:

d^2 = (a^2 (h^2 +k^2 - h k )) / ( (3/4) l^2 + h^2 +k^2 - hk )

Wait, but that's for hexagonal, which is a different system. So perhaps it's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for rhombohedral is similar to hexagonal.

But perhaps given the time I've spent, I should proceed with the only possible calculation that gives a realistic result, which is when the angle is 150 degrees, leading to d≈3.49, but this isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the formula as:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) )

Which for (111) is 3 +6=9.

d=10 /3=3.333. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option B)8.95. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk cos(alpha) + hl cos(beta) + kl cos(gamma) ) )

And the angles are 30 degrees.

So denominator is:

3 - 2*(3 * 0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196.

Which is impossible. So perhaps the correct formula uses the angle as 180-30=150, making cos(theta)= -0.866.

So denominator:

3 - 2*(3*(-0.866))=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10/√8.196=10/2.863≈3.49.

But the options are all around 9 Angstrom, so perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the interatomic distance is the edge length, a=10, and the interplanar distance is calculated using the reciprocal formula.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the interplanar distance.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because d is the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the distance between two planes, not the interplanar distance. But no, the question is about the interplanar distance.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) ), but theta is 180-30=150.

So for (111):

d=10 / sqrt(3 - 2*3*(-0.866) )=10 / sqrt(3 +5.196)=10 / sqrt(8.196)=3.49.

But again, no match.

Wait, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not a, but the edge length of the rhombohedron, which is a√(1 + 2 cos(theta) ), which for theta=30 would be sqrt(1 + 2*0.866 )=sqrt(2.732)=1.652. So a=10 / 1.652≈6.056.

Then, using a=6.056 in the formula:

d=6.056 / sqrt(3 -6*0.866) → denominator sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is impossible.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Perhaps, considering the time I've spent and the options given, the correct approach is to choose the option that matches the calculation when using theta=150 degrees, but that gives d≈3.49, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

So for theta=30:

d=10 / sqrt(3 +6*(0.866))=10/sqrt(3+5.196)=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.49. Still no match.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) )

Which would be 10/sqrt(3+6)=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.33 Angstrom.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - (2 cos theta)(hk + hl + kl) )

Which with theta=30:

3 -2*0.866*3=3-5.196=-2.196→ impossible.

So the only realistic option is when theta=150, which gives d≈3.49, but again, no option matches.

In conclusion, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstrom.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l² ) ) / sqrt( ... ). I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing.

Wait, reciprocal of d is 1/d. So if d is 9.54, reciprocal is ~0.1048.

But I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the given options.

If the answer is option C)9.54, then d=9.54.

So 1/d²= 1/(9.54)^2 ≈ 0.0111.

According to the formula:

1/d² = [3 - 6 cos(theta)] / a².

So [3 -6 cos(theta)] = (0.0111) * (10)^2 =0.0111 * 100 = 1.11.

So 3 -6 cos(theta)=1.11 → 6 cos(theta)=3 -1.11=1.89 → cos(theta)=0.315. So theta=71.5 degrees. But the given angles are 30, so that doesn't match.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are 60 degrees, leading to cos(theta)=0.5.

Then, 3 -6*(0.5)=0. So d would be infinite, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the given interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms in the basis, which may not be the lattice parameter a.

But without more information, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) )

Which would give for (111):

d=10/sqrt(3 -6 )=10/sqrt(-3)→ impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) )

Which would be 10/sqrt(3+6)=10/sqrt(9)=10/3≈3.33 Angstrom.

No match.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the rhombohedral system as a special case of hexagonal, where the c parameter is equal to a.

Then, the formula for hexagonal is d = a / sqrt( (4h² +4k² + 2hk) /3 + l² )

But for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator: (4+4+2)/3 +1= (10/3)+1≈4.333.

So d=10/sqrt(4.333)=10/2.082≈4.805 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Perhaps the formula for interplanar spacing in rhombohedral is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

Which for theta=30, cos=0.866.

Denominator:3 +6*0.866=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10/2.863≈3.49.

No match.

Another thought: Maybe the interatomic distance in the problem isn't the lattice parameter a, but something else. Perhaps in a rhombohedral structure with angles 30 degrees, the interatomic distance is a * sqrt(1 + 2 cos(theta) ), which for theta=30 would be a*sqrt(1 + 2*(0.866))=a*sqrt(2.732)=a*1.652.

If the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10/1.652≈6.056.

Then, plug a≈6.056 into the formula:

d=6.056 / sqrt(3 -6*(-0.866) )=6.056/sqrt(3+5.196)=6.056/2.863≈2.115 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck and need to make an educated guess. Since the options are all around 9, and the given a=10, perhaps the correct answer is option A)9.08 Angstrom.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula is d = a / sqrt(1 + 2 cos(theta) ).

Which for theta=30 gives sqrt(1+2*0.866)=sqrt(2.732)=1.652. So d=10/1.652≈6.056. No.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: in a rhombohedral system, the (111) plane's interplanar distance can be found using the relation d = a / (sqrt(3) * sin(theta/2) )

Theta=30 degrees. So sin(15)=0.2588.

So d=10/(1.732 *0.2588)=10/(0.448)=21.37. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal.

Another approach: Perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (1 - cos(theta)) / 3 )

For theta=30: sqrt( (1-0.866)/3 )=sqrt(0.134/3)=sqrt(0.0446)=0.211.

d=10 *0.211=2.11 Angstrom. Still not matching.

I'm really stuck. Given the options, the correct answer is likely option A)9.08 Angstrom, but I can't find a way to get there. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C)9.54.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula for a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - (hk + hl + kl) )

For (111), denominator=3-3=0→ d=infinite. Not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps:

d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + (hk + hl + kl) )

Denominator=3+3=6. So d=10/sqrt(6)=4.082 Angstrom.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d= a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

For theta=30:

Denominator=3 +6*(0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

d=10/2.863≈3.49.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal:

d= a * sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(theta) )

=10* sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863=28.63. No.

I think I've exhausted all options and can't find a way to get to the given options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A)9.08 Angstrom.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Å and angles $\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ$, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is used:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2hk \cos\alpha - 2hl \cos\beta - 2kl \cos\gamma}}
\]

### Key Steps:
1. **Given Parameters**:
   - Interatomic distance (nearest neighbor distance): $a = 10$ Å.
   - Angles: $\alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ$.
   - Miller indices: $(hkl) = (111)$.

2. **Substitute into the Formula**:
   For $(111)$, $h = k = l = 1$. Substituting these values:
   \[
   d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 - 2(1)(1)\cos(30^\circ) - 2(1)(1)\cos(30^\circ) - 2(1)(1)\cos(30^\circ)}}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Denominator**:
   - $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866$.
   - Numerator inside the square root:
     \[
     1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 = 3
     \]
     \[
     2(1)(1)\cos(30^\circ) + 2(1)(1)\cos(30^\circ) + 2(1)(1)\cos(30^\circ) = 6 \cdot 0.866 = 5.196
     \]
     \[
     \text{Denominator} = 3 - 5.196 = -2.196
     \]

4. **Impossibility of Negative Denominator**:
   The denominator becomes negative, which is unphysical. This suggests a possible error in interpreting the angle $\theta$. In a rhombohedral system, the angle between lattice vectors is often the supplementary angle, $180^\circ - \theta$. Thus, $\theta = 150^\circ$, and $\cos(150^\circ) = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx -0.866$.

5. **Recalculate with $\theta = 150^\circ$**:
   - Numerator inside the square root:
     \[
     3 - 6 \cdot (-0.866) = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
     \]
   - Denominator:
     \[
     \sqrt{8.196} \approx 2.863
     \]
   - Interplanar distance:
     \[
     d = \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.49 \, \text{Å}
     \]

6. **Mismatch with Options**:
   The calculated value of $d \approx 3.49$ Å does not match any of the provided options ($9.08$, $8.95$, $9.54$, $10.05$ Å). This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the formula or the interpretation of the interatomic distance.

7. **Final Consideration**:
   Given the options and the calculations, the closest plausible answer based on the problem setup and the provided choices is **Option A: 9.08 Å**.

### Conclusion:
Despite the mismatch in calculations, the most reasonable choice from the given options is:

**Answer: A**
