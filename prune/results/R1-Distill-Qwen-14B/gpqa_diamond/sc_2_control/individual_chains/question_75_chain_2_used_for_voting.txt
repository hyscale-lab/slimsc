Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't overexpressing in the transgenic mouse model. The researcher introduced a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, which is the beginning of the protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But they're not getting the protein expressed as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I notice that it starts with 5' ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). Then there's TAC, which is tyrosine. Hmm, wait, the HA tag's sequence is probably right after the start. But I'm thinking about the reading frame and possible issues in the construct.

The problem might be a frameshift or a premature stop codon. Let me check the sequence for any in-frame stop codons. Stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA. I'm going to scan the sequence quickly.

Let me look for the first possible stop codon. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CC... Let me parse it in triplets:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), GAA (E), GAT (D), TAC (Y)... Wait, I'm not seeing any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the early parts. Hmm.

Wait, looking further into the sequence. Let me look for any TGA. Let's see: ...CCAGAT TAC GC... No, that's GCA GAT TAC. Oh wait, looking for TGA. Let's see:

Another approach: perhaps the HA tag is causing an issue. Or maybe the insert includes a stop codon introduced by mistake. But the given sequence doesn't show any obvious stop codons in the early parts.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the reading frame. If the construct has an extra nucleotide, it could cause a frameshift, leading to a premature stop. But the provided sequence is a plus strand, which might be the coding sequence. Alternatively, maybe the gene has a premature stop codon due to a mutation.

Wait, another possibility: the plasmid's selection marker or the construct's design. Oh, wait, the construct might not have a poly-A tail or proper termination signals. But the question states that the problem is in the sequence of the plus strand.

Wait, looking at the sequence again, perhaps there's a TGA or another stop codon in the middle. Let me look more carefully.

Looking through the sequence:

...TACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGT TCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, let me look for TGA in the sequence. Hmm, looking for TGA, I see:

Looking at the part: ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see at the very end: ...GAGTGA3'. So the last three nucleotides are GAG TGA. Wait, the sequence ends with TGA. But wait, the end of the provided sequence is ...GCGAGTGA3'. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Ah, so the construct includes the TGA codon at the end. So the gene is being terminated prematurely. Why is that a problem? Because the transgene is designed to overexpress GADD45G with the HA tag. If the construct has a premature stop codon, the protein won't be made beyond that point.

Wait, but the plasmid is designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus. If the coding sequence ends with a TGA, that's a stop codon. So the protein would be HA-tagged followed by whatever comes after. But wait, the TGA is at the very end, so perhaps the gene doesn't have a proper termination signal, and the TGA is part of the original gene.

Wait, the construct might not have a poly-A signal or proper termination, but that's a different issue. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag is added correctly, but when the gene is cloned into the vector, perhaps the reading frame is wrong, leading to a premature stop.

Wait, looking back, the starting ATG is followed by TAC, which is a Y, so the HA tag (which starts with YPYD) should be present. But if the construct is premature, the HA tag wouldn't be made, or the protein would be truncated.

Wait, the very end of the provided DNA sequence is ...GCGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the gene construct ends with TGA, so the protein would stop there. But that's normal for a gene's termination. Unless the TGA is in the middle, causing a premature stop.

Wait, looking at the sequence, maybe I missed a stop codon earlier. Let me scan again.

Looking for TGA, TAA, TAG. Let's see:

At the end, I see ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, another area: ...CGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see a TGA here: ...GCGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the construct's coding sequence ends with TGA. So the protein would be HA-tagged, then the rest of the GADD45G sequence, ending at that TGA. So that's a normal termination, right? So why isn't the protein expressed?

Hmm. Maybe the issue is that the expression vector doesn't have a polyadenylation signal, so the mRNA isn't processed correctly. But the question says the issue is in the plus strand's sequence. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is causing a premature stop.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's sequence introduces a stop codon. HA is a peptide derived from the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus. Its coding sequence is something like YPYDHHQWLYVFFK. So the DNA sequence for HA would be TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), etc. Wait, the initial part of the provided DNA is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., which is ATG followed by TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), etc. So the HA tag (YPYD) would be the first few amino acids. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the HA tag isn't followed by the correct start codon. Wait, no, the HA is at the N-terminus, so the ATG is the start, then HA, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, perhaps there's a stop codon in the middle of the HA tag. Let me check the first few codons.

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCAGAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Wait, wait, let me parse the initial part as triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA...

Wait, the 5th codon is GAT (D), 6th is GTT (V), 7th is CCA (P), 8th is GAT (D), 9th is TAC (Y), 10th is GCC (A), 11th is AAA (K), 12th is TGA (stop).

Oh wait! So looking at the first 12 codons:

1. ATG (M)
2. TAC (Y)
3. CCA (P)
4. TAC (Y)
5. GAT (D)
6. GTT (V)
7. CCA (P)
8. GAT (D)
9. TAC (Y)
10. GCC (A)
11. AAA (K)
12. TGA (stop)

Wait a minute! The 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the HA tag is only up to the 11th codon, which is K (lysine), and then the 12th is stop. So the protein stops right after the HA tag. That would mean the HA tag is present, but then the protein stops, so the GADD45G sequence isn't made.

Wait, but why would that happen? Because the construct includes a stop codon in the middle, which is the TGA. So the coding sequence is ATG ... TGA, stopping the translation early. So the recombinant protein would only be the HA tag, and no GADD45G. But then, why isn't the HA tag expressed?

Wait, perhaps the HA tag includes a stop codon, so the ribosome stops there, and the HA tag isn't even made. Because the ribosome would terminate at the first stop codon it encounters.

Wait, the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, which is the beginning of the protein. But the construct includes a stop codon (TGA) after the 11th amino acid. So the protein would be HA followed by some other amino acids, but then it stops.

Wait, but the HA tag is YPYD..., which is the first four amino acids. The first few codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. So the HA tag is correctly added, but the stop codon comes in the 12th codon.

So the ribosome would translate up to the stop codon, making a short peptide, and then stop. So the GADD45G isn't expressed because the stop codon is in the way.

Ah, so the problem is that the construct has a premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding region, causing the ribosome to terminate early. That would explain why the protein isn't overexpressed.

Looking back at the options:

Option B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.

But wait, why would the ribosome terminate early? Because the stop codon is present in the coding sequence. So the construct includes a stop codon in the middle, causing the premature termination.

So the correct answer is B.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Yes. So the presence of the TGA codon in the coding sequence would cause the ribosome to stop early, leading to no full-length protein being produced.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The provided DNA sequence starts with the start codon (ATG) and includes a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus, followed by the coding sequence for GADD45G. However, upon closer inspection, the sequence contains a premature stop codon (TGA) at the 12th codon, which is in the middle of the coding region. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length GADD45G protein from being synthesized. As a result, the protein is truncated, and the overexpression expected from the construct does not occur.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is incorrect because the HA tag sequence appears intact at the beginning of the coding region.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct because the premature stop codon (TGA) in the coding sequence causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** This is incorrect because the issue lies in the coding sequence, not in proteolysis.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is incorrect because the premature stop codon is TGA, not UAA, and the presence of a stop codon is the primary issue.

The correct answer is **B**, as the premature stop codon in the coding sequence is responsible for the early termination of translation.

Answer: B
