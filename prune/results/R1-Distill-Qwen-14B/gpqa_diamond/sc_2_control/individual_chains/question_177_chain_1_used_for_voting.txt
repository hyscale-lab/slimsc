Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand the question.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The peak wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Through spectroscopy, their radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The task is to find by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. So I think the key here is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which relates a star's luminosity to its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where L is luminosity, R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars are black bodies, their luminosities depend on R squared and temperature to the fourth power. So the ratio of their luminosities would be (R₁²/R₂²) * (T₁⁴ / T₂⁴).

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T, so if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2. So their temperatures are equal.

Wait, but wait a minute. No, because the stars are moving with radial velocities. Oh, right! The radial velocity causes a Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength will be different from the rest wavelength. So the peak wavelength we observe is affected by their velocities.

Ah, right! So the observed wavelength λ_observed is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by the Doppler shift formula. For stars moving away, the wavelength is redshifted, and for those moving towards us, it's blueshifted.

The formula for Doppler shift is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), but wait, no, that's the relativistic formula. Wait, but for non-relativistic speeds, the approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, in the non-relativistic case, the Doppler shift is v_r / c. But maybe for this problem, it's better to use the exact relativistic formula.

Wait, but the stars' velocities are given. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 is shifted.

But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Because Star_1's velocity is zero, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) ), perhaps? Or maybe it's (1 + v2/c) as an approximation.

Wait, let me think again. The Doppler effect formula is a bit tricky. The relativistic Doppler shift is given by λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) }, where v is the radial velocity, positive for moving away (redshift) and negative for moving towards (blueshift). If v is much smaller than c, we can approximate this as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v/c).

Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1. Star_2's radial velocity is 700 km/s, but I'm not sure if it's moving towards or away. The problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. I think the sign might matter. Let's see. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, I think. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, it's moving away, so its observed wavelength is longer (redshifted) compared to its rest wavelength.

Wait, but the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So λ_rest1 = λ_obs1, since Star_1's radial velocity is zero. And λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * Doppler factor.

So λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * (Doppler factor) ?

Because λ_obs1 = λ_rest1, and λ_obs2 = Doppler factor * λ_rest2. And since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have λ_rest1 = Doppler factor * λ_rest2.

Alternatively, let me write the equations.

For Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest (since v_r1=0).

For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ1_obs = λ2_obs

So λ1_rest = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So for each star, λ_rest = b / T.

So λ1_rest = b / T1, λ2_rest = b / T2.

Wait, but since they have the same observed wavelengths, their rest wavelengths may not be the same because of the Doppler effect. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this step by step.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is given by the rest wavelength multiplied by the Doppler shift factor. So for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ1_rest (since v=0). For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ2_rest * D, where D is the Doppler factor.

But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ1_obs = λ2_obs → λ1_rest = λ2_rest * D.

Hmm, but from Wien's law, each star's rest wavelength λ_rest is b / T. So,

λ1_rest = b / T1,

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting into λ1_rest = λ2_rest * D,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * D → 1/T1 = (1/T2) * D → T2 = T1 * D.

Wait, but D is the Doppler shift factor. So what is D in terms of v2? Let me define D correctly.

The Doppler shift factor D is given by:

D = sqrt( [ (1 + v_r / c) ] / [ 1 - v_r / c ] )

But wait, v_r is Star_2's radial velocity, which is 700 km/s. Let's compute v2 in terms of c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s, so v2 = 700 km/s → v2/c ≈ 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

Since v2 is much smaller than c, we can use the approximation:

D ≈ 1 + (v_r / c) + (v_r²)/(2c²) + ... 

But perhaps the first-order approximation is sufficient.

Alternatively, for small velocities, the Doppler shift formula can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r/c). So let's use that.

So, D ≈ (1 + v2/c) → because when a source moves away, the observed wavelength increases.

Wait, but for a source moving away, v_r is positive, so λ_obs is larger than λ_rest, correct.

So, using the approximation:

D ≈ 1 + (v2/c).

So, let's compute D.

v2 is 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s. So v2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/(300) = approximately 0.023333.

So D ≈ 1 + 0.023333 ≈ 1.023333.

Wait, but wait: in the Doppler formula, is it (1 + v/c) or (1 + v/c) times something else? Let me think again.

The full Doppler formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

But for small v/c, the square root can be approximated as (1 + v/(2c)), perhaps?

Wait, let me expand sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ), where x = v/c. 

(1 + x)/(1 - x) = (1 + x)(1 + x + x² + ... ) ) ≈ 1 + 2x + 2x² for small x.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute for small x, sqrt( (1+x)/(1-x) ) ≈ (1 + x/(2) ) / (1 - x/(2) ) )?

Wait, maybe I should just compute the Taylor expansion of sqrt( (1+x)/(1-x) ) around x=0.

Let me set f(x) = sqrt( (1+x)/(1-x) ) = (1+x)/(1-x) )^0.5.

Compute the first-order approximation: f(x) ≈ 1 + (x/2) * ( derivative at x=0 )

The derivative f’(x) = 0.5 * [ (1+x)/(1-x) )^(-0.5) ) * ( (1)(1-x) + (1+x)(1) )/( (1-x)^2 ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the logarithm.

ln(f(x)) = 0.5 [ ln(1+x) - ln(1-x) ].

Expanding ln(1+x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - ...,

ln(1-x) ≈ -x - x²/2 - x³/3 - ...

So ln(f(x)) ≈ 0.5 [ (x - x²/2 ) - (-x - x²/2 ) ) ] → 0.5 [ 2x ] → x.

So ln(f(x)) ≈ x → f(x) ≈ e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2.

But x is small, so for x = v/c=0.02333, x² is about 0.000544, so f(x) ≈ 1 + 0.02333 + 0.000544/2 ≈ 1.023874.

Alternatively, using the approximation f(x) ≈ 1 + x + x²/2.

Wait, but maybe I can compute it numerically.

x=0.023333.

(1+x)/(1-x) = (1.023333)/(0.976667) ≈ 1.048148.

Then the square root of that is sqrt(1.048148) ≈ 1.02376.

Hmm, which is close to the approximation 1 + x + x²/2 = 1 + 0.023333 + (0.023333)^2 / 2.

Compute that: 0.023333^2 is approximately 0.000544, so 0.000544 / 2 = 0.000272.

So 1 + 0.023333 = 1.023333, plus 0.000272 gives 1.023605. But the actual square root was about 1.02376. So the approximation is slightly off but close enough for our purposes.

So D ≈ 1.02376.

So going back, T2 = T1 * D.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.02376.

Now, the luminosities are given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given R1=1.5 R2.

Substituting R1=1.5 R2, and T2 = T1 * D.

So:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * (T1 D)^4 ) )

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * T1^4 * D^4 )

Simplify:

= 2.25 / D^4.

Because R2² and T1^4 cancel out.

So D is about 1.02376.

Compute D^4:

Let me compute 1.02376^4.

First, compute 1.02376^2:

1.02376 * 1.02376 = let's compute step by step.

1.02376 * 1.02376:

1 * 1 = 1

1 * 0.02376 = 0.02376

0.02376 *1 = 0.02376

0.02376 *0.02376 ≈ 0.000564.

Adding all together, but perhaps a better approach is to compute (1.02376)^2:

(1 + 0.02376)^2 = 1 + 2*0.02376 + (0.02376)^2.

Which is 1 + 0.04752 + 0.000564 ≈ 1.048084.

Then, (1.048084)^2 = (1.048084)^2.

Again, compute (1 + 0.048084)^2 = 1 + 2*0.048084 + (0.048084)^2.

Compute term by term:

2*0.048084 = 0.096168.

(0.048084)^2 ≈ 0.002312.

So sum is 1 + 0.096168 = 1.096168, plus 0.002312 → 1.09848.

But wait, maybe that's an approximation. Let me compute 1.048084^2 more accurately.

1.048084 * 1.048084:

Compute 1 * 1.048084 → 1.048084.

0.04 * 1.048084 → 0.04192336.

0.008084 * 1.048084 → approximately 0.008084 * 1 is 0.008084, 0.008084 *0.048084 is about 0.000389.

So adding:

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 1.048084 * 1.048084 step by step.

Let me compute 1.048084 * 1.048084:

= (1 + 0.048084)^2.

= 1^2 + 2*1*0.048084 + (0.048084)^2.

= 1 + 0.096168 + 0.002312 (approx).

Which totals 1.09848.

So D^4 ≈ 1.09848.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 / 1.09848 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.09848.

Well, 1.09848 is approximately 1.0985.

So 2.25 ÷ 1.0985:

Let me compute this division.

We can approximate 1.0985 = 1.1 approximately, but let's be more precise.

Compute 2.25 / 1.0985.

Let me compute 1.0985 × 2.05 = ?

1.0985 * 2 = 2.197.

1.0985 * 0.05 = 0.054925.

So 2.197 + 0.054925 = 2.251925.

Which is just over 2.25. So 2.05 gives us about 2.251925, which is a bit more than 2.25.

So 2.25 ÷ 1.0985 ≈ 2.05 - a little less. Because 2.05 *1.0985 is 2.251925, which is 0.001925 over 2.25.

So perhaps 2.05 - (0.001925 / 1.0985) → 2.05 - (approx 0.00175) → approximately 2.04825.

But let me compute more accurately.

We have 2.25 / 1.09848 = ?

Let me write this as 225 ÷ 109.848.

Let me compute 225 ÷ 109.848.

109.848 * 2 = 219.696.

So 2 * 109.848 = 219.696. The difference between 225 and 219.696 is 5.304.

So 5.304 / 109.848 ≈ 0.0483.

So 2 + 0.0483 = 2.0483.

So approximately 2.0483.

Wait, but earlier when I approximated using 1.09848 as 1.0985, I found 2.05 as the approximate factor, but more precisely, it's about 2.048.

Wait, but wait, the options are around 2.2 to 2.35. So I must have made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the luminosity ratio formula.

Let me double-check.

The luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Because L is proportional to R^2 T^4.

Wait, earlier I had:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4) → (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Ah, right. So I think I miscalculated the ratio earlier.

Wait, what's T1 and T2?

From earlier, we had:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * D.

But using Wien's law, λ_rest = b / T.

So λ1_rest = b / T1.

λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting into λ1_rest = D * λ2_rest,

b/T1 = D * (b/T2).

Cancel b, get 1/T1 = D * (1/T2) → T2 = T1 * D.

So T2/T1 = D.

So (T1/T2) = 1/D.

So the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1/D)^4.

Which is 2.25 * (1/D)^4.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 2.25 / D^4, which is correct.

So, with D ≈ 1.02376, D^4 ≈ 1.09848.

So 2.25 / 1.09848 ≈ 2.048.

Wait, but the options given are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, none of these are around 2.04. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the peak emission in a different way.

Wait, another approach: the peak wavelength we observe is the same for both stars. So each star's observed peak wavelength is λ_obs.

But for Star_1, since its velocity is zero, λ_obs1 = λ_rest1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (Doppler factor D), where D depends on its velocity.

But the problem says λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = D * λ_rest2.

But λ_rest is b / T.

So,

b / T1 = D * (b / T2).

→ 1/T1 = D (1/T2) → T2 = D T1.

So, T2 = D T1.

Thus, the ratio T1/T2 = 1/D.

Wait, no, T2 = D T1 → T1 = T2 / D.

Wait, perhaps I should go back.

The observed wavelengths are the same: λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So,

λ1_rest * (1 + v1/c) ) = λ2_rest * (1 + v2/c) ), but wait, no, because the Doppler shift for Star_2 is due to its radial velocity.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But for Star_1, v=0, so λ_obs1 = λ_rest1.

For Star_2, v=700 km/s away (assuming positive v), so λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So,

λ_rest1 = λ_rest2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But λ_rest is given by Wien's law as λ_rest = b / T.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

→ T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, perhaps this is a more accurate approach.

Given that v is 700 km/s, which is 700 / (3e5) = 0.0023333 c.

So,

(1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333,

(1 - v/c) ≈ 0.9976667.

So the ratio (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ≈ (1.002333)/(0.9976667) ≈ 1.00467.

Wait, more precisely, let me compute this:

(1.002333)/(0.9976667) = ?

Approximating using division:

1.002333 ÷ 0.9976667.

Hmm, note that 0.9976667 is approximately 0.9976667 ≈ 1 - 0.0023333.

So, 1.002333 ÷ (1 - 0.0023333) ≈ 1.002333 * (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ 1.002333 + 1.002333 * 0.0023333.

Wait, using the approximation 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x.

So,

(1.002333) * (1 + 0.0023333) ≈ 1.002333 + (1.002333 * 0.0023333).

Compute 1.002333 * 0.0023333 ≈ 0.0023333 * 1.002333 ≈ 0.00234.

So sum is approximately 1.002333 + 0.00234 = 1.004673.

So sqrt(1.004673) ≈ ?

Well, sqrt(1.004673) ≈ 1.002333.

Because (1.002333)^2 = 1 + 2*0.002333 + (0.002333)^2) ≈ 1.004666 + 0.0000054 ≈ 1.004671, which is close to 1.004673.

So sqrt(1.004673) ≈ 1.002333.

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Thus, T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99768.

Now, the luminosity ratio is:

L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (0.99768)^4.

Compute (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Compute (0.99768)^4.

Since 0.99768 is close to 1, perhaps we can expand it using the binomial approximation.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 - 4x + 6x² - 4x³ + x^4, where x = 1 - 0.99768 = 0.00232.

Wait, let me compute x = 0.00232.

So,

(0.99768)^4 ≈ 1 - 4*(0.00232) + 6*(0.00232)^2 - 4*(0.00232)^3 + (0.00232)^4.

Compute each term:

- 4x = 4 * 0.00232 = 0.00928.

6x² = 6 * (0.00232)^2 = 6 * 0.0000053824 ≈ 0.0000322944.

4x^3 =4 * (0.00232)^3 ≈ 4 * 0.0000000124 ≈ 0.0000000496.

x^4 ≈ (0.00232)^4 ≈ 0.00000000029.

So summing all terms:

1 - 0.00928 = 0.99072.

+ 0.0000322944 → 0.9907522944.

- 0.0000000496 → 0.9907522448.

+ 0.00000000029 → 0.9907522451.

So approximately 0.990752.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

0.99768^4.

We can compute ln(0.99768) ≈ -0.00233.

So ln(0.99768^4) =4*(-0.00233) =-0.00932.

e^(-0.00932) ≈ 1 -0.00932 + (0.00932^2)/2 - ... ≈ 0.99076.

Which is close to the earlier approximation.

So (0.99768)^4 ≈ 0.99075.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.99075 ≈ 2.25 * 0.99075.

Compute 2.25 * 0.99075.

Well, 2 * 0.99075 = 1.9815, 0.25 * 0.99075 = 0.2476875.

Adding them: 1.9815 + 0.2476875 = 2.2291875.

So approximately 2.229, which is around 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So the answer would be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperatures Using Wien's Law and Doppler Shift
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths of the two stars are the same. From Wien's law, the rest wavelength is inversely proportional to temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest}} = \frac{b}{T}
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is zero, the observed wavelength is equal to its rest wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}}
\]

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\). The relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since the observed wavelengths are the same (\(\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}}\)), we equate the rest wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = b / T\)):

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{T_2} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
T_2 = T_1 \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

### Step 2: Approximating the Doppler Factor
The velocity of Star_2 is \(v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), and the speed of light is \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

The Doppler factor is:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}}
\]

Approximating using the small velocity expansion:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1 + x}{1 - x}} \approx 1 + x \quad \text{for small } x
\]

Here, \(x = 0.002333\), so:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{1.002333}{0.997667}} \approx 1.002333
\]

Thus:

\[
T_2 \approx T_1 \times 1.002333
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
The radius of Star_1 is \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

Substituting \(R_1 / R_2 = 1.5\) and \(T_1 / T_2 = 1 / 1.002333\):

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4
\]

First, compute \((1.5)^2\):

\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Next, compute \((1 / 1.002333)^4\). Using the approximation \((1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x\) for small \(x\), where \(x = 0.002333\):

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \approx (1 - 0.002333)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.002333) = 0.99075
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99075 \approx 2.229
\]
