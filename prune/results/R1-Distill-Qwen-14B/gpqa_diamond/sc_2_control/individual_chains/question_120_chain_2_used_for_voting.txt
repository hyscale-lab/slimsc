Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D with different power dependencies on plx.

Wait, parallax... I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So as the distance increases, parallax decreases. Parallax is in arcseconds.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So, if I consider a range of parallax values, how does the count of stars in each such range change with plx?

Since stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their density in space is uniform. Wait, but how does that translate into the number we observe?

Let me think about how many stars we observe at a certain distance. The number of stars should depend on the volume of space at that distance. But wait, when you're looking at a shell at a certain distance d, the volume is the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). So the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the surface area, which is 4πd², times the number density (n) of stars. But wait, the problem says uniform distribution, so n is constant.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the number per unit change in parallax. So for a small change in plx, how does the number of stars change.

Since plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d. So if I have a small change in plx, say dplx, that corresponds to a change in distance dd. Let me express this mathematically.

From plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the change in distance is inversely proportional to the square of the parallax.

But wait, the number of stars in a shell is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness (dd). Because the density is uniform, the number of stars N in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Let's substitute d = 1/plx. So d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2. Also, dd is the thickness, but from earlier, dd is - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/(plx)^2) * ( - (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but the number can't be negative, so maybe I should take the absolute value. So,

N = n * 4π (1/(plx)^2) * (1/plx²) |dplx|

Simplify: N = n * 4π (1/(plx)^4) |dplx|

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So for a small change dplx, the number is proportional to 1/(plx)^4. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's the number in a small range. So the number per unit plx would be N per dplx, which is 1/(plx^4) * n *4π.

So the number density in terms of plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options: option A is ~1/plx^4. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait a second, is there another way to think about it? Because sometimes when dealing with distributions, you have to consider how the variables transform.

Alternatively, the differential number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4π d² dd. But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Also, dd = d(dplx) = - (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/(plx^2)) * (1/plx^2) dplx

Which again gives N proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx. So the number of stars in a dplx interval is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Therefore, the number per unit parallax (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the answer is option A.

To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space. The parallax of a star is inversely related to its distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the surface area of the shell (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) and the number density of stars (\( n \)).

The number of stars \( N \) in such a shell is given by:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \cdot dd
\]

Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting this into the equation for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \cdot dd
\]

The change in distance \( dd \) can be expressed in terms of the change in parallax \( d\text{plx} \) using the derivative \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the equation for \( N \), we find:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} |d\text{plx}|\right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot |d\text{plx}|
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( d\text{plx} \)) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \).

The correct answer is:
