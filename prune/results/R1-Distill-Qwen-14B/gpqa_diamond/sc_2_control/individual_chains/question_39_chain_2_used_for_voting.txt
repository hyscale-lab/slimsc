Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The particles are measured, and none are found outside the region x=1 to x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding a particle. So the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from -infinity to 1 should be zero, and the same from 3 to infinity. But wait, no, actually, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But I think the actual wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, meaning the integral of |ψ|² from all space must be 1. Oh, but wait, the question says that when they measured, all the particles were found between 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, but wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that doesn't look like a function that's zero outside x=1 to x=3. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the wave function as given is only valid in the region where the particle can exist, and it's zero elsewhere. Because the measurements found none outside x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero for x <1 and x>3. So the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but maybe that's only in the region x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside that interval.

Alternatively, maybe the given wave function is just a part of the entire function, which is non-zero only between 1 and 3. But that complicates things a bit. Let me think. The wave function ψ(x) must be zero outside 1<x<3 because when they measured, the particles weren't found elsewhere. So the wave function is zero except between x=1 and x=3. So the function given is valid only in that region, and zero otherwise.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That might be part of the actual wave function, but perhaps it's multiplied by some step functions to make it zero outside. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is correct only in the region 1<x<3, and zero otherwise.

So to compute the normalization, the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be 1. Because the wave function is zero elsewhere, the entire integral over all space is just the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ|² dx. So that's what we'll compute and set equal to 1 to find 'a'.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². The wave function is ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ is a complex number. To find |ψ|², we calculate ψ multiplied by its complex conjugate.

The complex conjugate of ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply them:

ψ * ψ* = [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)(-0.5i)

Wait, let me compute it properly. Alternatively, I can note that |a + b|^2 = (a + b)(a* + b*), but since ψ has real and imaginary parts, perhaps it's easier to compute as (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

Wait, ψ = A + B i, where A is real and B is real? Wait, no, ψ is [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5 i. So the real part is [a/(sqrt(1+x))], and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So |ψ|² = (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So that's [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Because (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b², yes. So if ψ = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then ψ* is a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when you multiply, you get (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25, because (0.5i)^2 is -0.25, but wait, no: the product would be (a/(sqrt(1+x)) )² + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms would involve 0.5i * (-0.5i) = 0.25.

Wait, let me compute it correctly. (a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i) * (a/(sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i) = [a²/(1+x)] + [a/(sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i] - [0.5i * a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5i)(0.5i).

Wait, no. Let's expand (a - b)(a + b) where a = a/(sqrt(1+x)), and b = 0.5i.

So (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 + a b - a b -b^2. Which simplifies to a^2 - b^2.

Wait, no, because (a - b)(a + b) = a² - (b)^2. So here, a is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and b is 0.5i.

So a² is [a²/(1+x)], and b² is (0.5i)^2 = 0.25 * (-1) = -0.25.

So |ψ|² = a²/(1+x) - ( -0.25 ) = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Yes, that's correct.

So the probability density is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

Now, the integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because the wave function is normalized.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx + Integral [0.25] dx, from 1 to 3.

Compute each part separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

So evaluating from 1 to 3, it's ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Let's solve for a².

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of that: sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options: option B is 0.85, which is close. Let me check for calculation errors.

Wait, let me recalculate 0.5 / ln(2).

ln(2) is about 0.69314718056.

So 0.5 / 0.69314718 ≈ 0.72134752.

The square root of 0.72134752 is approximately 0.849. So rounding to two decimal places, 0.85.

So the correct answer would be option B) 0.85.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is proportional to the square modulus of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \). For a complex wave function of the form \( \psi(x) = A + Bi \), the probability density is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = A^2 + B^2
\]

Here, \( A = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \) (real part) and \( B = -0.5 \) (imaginary part). Thus:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside the region \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this region equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

### First Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
\]

### Combining Results:
Adding the two integrals and setting the total equal to 1:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, \( a \approx 0.85 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
