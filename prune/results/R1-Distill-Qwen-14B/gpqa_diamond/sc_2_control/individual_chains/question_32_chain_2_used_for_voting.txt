Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I've heard a bit about colliders in my classes, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through this.

First, I need to find the energy of the particle. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its rest mass and its velocity. Oh right, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, the speed v is given as 0.96c. So let me plug that in. Let's compute gamma first. 

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let's see, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714... Wait, wait, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, because 0.28*3=0.84, 0.28*0.5=0.14, so 0.84+0.14=0.98. Oh, so 1 / 0.28 is about 3.5714? Let me check: 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, the problem mentions nucleus X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus would be approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but actually, each proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c² when considering their rest mass energy, but wait, no—wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV, which is 0.938 GeV. Let me confirm. Yes, the proton rest mass is about 0.938 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait, the mass of Li-6 would be the sum of its protons and neutrons. Each neutron has a mass of approximately 0.939 GeV/c², very close to the proton's. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass energy is (3 * 0.938) + (3 * 0.939) ) GeV. Let me compute that:

3 * 0.938 = 2.814 GeV
3 * 0.939 = 2.817 GeV
Total: 2.814 + 2.817 = 5.631 GeV.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should consider that the actual mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of its nucleons due to binding energy. Oh, right! The mass defect. So the actual rest mass of the lithium nucleus would be less than the sum of individual protons and neutrons. Hmm, but for this problem, I'm not sure if I'm supposed to account for that, because the problem doesn't provide specific values. Maybe the question expects me to use the mass of the nucleus as approximately equal to the sum of its nucleons. Alternatively, perhaps the problem just wants me to use the mass of the nucleus in terms of its atomic mass.

Wait, another approach. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So X is Li-6. The standard atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). One atomic mass unit is about 0.9315 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy of the nucleus is 6 * 0.9315 GeV. Let me compute that:

6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

Hmm, but earlier when I computed by adding protons and neutrons, I got 5.631 GeV. So which is correct? Well, wait, the mass of a neutron is about 0.939565 GeV/c², and a proton is about 0.938272 GeV/c². So let's compute Li-6's mass precisely.

Number of protons: 3, each 0.938272 GeV → 3 * 0.938272 = 2.814816 GeV

Number of neutrons: 3, each 0.939565 GeV → 3 * 0.939565 = 2.818695 GeV

Total without binding energy: 2.814816 + 2.818695 = 5.633511 GeV

But the actual mass of Li-6 is less because of the mass defect due to binding energy. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 5.640958 u, but wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, perhaps I should look for the exact rest mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the rest mass of the nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons. Hmm, but I'm not sure, but perhaps for this problem, the exact value isn't needed, and perhaps the rest mass is taken as 6 u.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. The rest energy of a nucleus is given by E = m c², where m is the rest mass. To find m, I can use the atomic mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units (u), then convert to GeV.

The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u. Wait, I think the exact value is 6.015122 u. Because looking up, the exact value for Li-6 is about 6.015122 u. So I'll use that.

So m = 6.015122 u. Now, 1 u is approximately 0.931494 GeV/c². So m = 6.015122 * 0.931494 GeV/c².

Let me compute that. 6 * 0.931494 is 5.588964. Then 0.015122 * 0.931494 ≈ 0.01405. So total m ≈ 5.588964 + 0.01405 ≈ 5.603014 GeV/c².

Wait, that's about 5.603 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute 6.015122 * 0.931494 directly.

Let me compute 6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964. 0.015122 * 0.931494.

0.01 * 0.931494 = 0.00931494.

0.005122 * 0.931494 = approximately 0.004766.

So total for 0.015122 * 0.931494 ≈ 0.00931494 + 0.004766 ≈ 0.014081.

So adding to 5.588964 gives 5.603045 GeV/c². So m ≈ 5.603045 GeV/c².

Wait, but maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the problem just gives the mass as 6 u, so m = 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV/c². Hmm, but if I proceed with 5.603 GeV, I'll get a slightly different result. So maybe the problem expects me to approximate the rest mass as 6 u, giving m = 5.589 GeV/c². Or perhaps the exact value is given, but I don't have it on hand. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. So the energy is gamma times m c squared. Since we're using units where c is 1, or at least, since m is in GeV/c², the energy would be gamma multiplied by m, because E = gamma m c², and when m is in GeV/c², then E in GeV.

So E = gamma * m.

So let's put the numbers in.

Gamma is about 3.5714 as I computed earlier.

So if m is 5.603 GeV/c², then E ≈ 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 *5 = 17.857, and 3.5714 * 0.603 is approximately 2.155. So total is approximately 20.012 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me be more precise. Let's compute 3.5714 * 5.603.

Breaking it down:

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.6 = 2.14284

3.5714 * 0.003 = 0.0107142

Adding them up: 17.857 + 2.14284 = 20.0 (approx) + 0.0107 = 20.0107 GeV.

Wait, but if I take m as 6 u, which is 5.589 GeV/c², then E would be 3.5714 * 5.589.

Hmm, 3.5714 *5 = 17.857, 3.5714 * 0.589.

Wait, 0.5 *3.5714 = 1.7857, 0.08 *3.5714=0.2857, 0.009*3.5714=0.03214.

So 1.7857 + 0.2857 = 2.0714 + 0.03214= 2.1035.

So total E = 17.857 (from 5) + 2.1035 (from 0.589) = 19.9605 GeV.

Wait, but that's when m is 5.589 GeV. But earlier, when I took m as 5.603 GeV, I got about 20.01 GeV. So depending on the value of m, the energy would vary a bit.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419

If I use the more precise m (5.603 GeV), I get about 20.01 GeV. But the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me recheck gamma.

v is 0.96c, so v^2 = (0.96)^2 c^2 = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. So gamma is 3.57142857.

So that part seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation of gamma. Let me compute 0.0784's square root more accurately.

Wait, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, that's exact. So sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So that's correct.

So perhaps the discrepancy comes from the mass of the nucleus. The problem says, X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015122 u. So m = 6.015122 u * 0.931494 GeV/u → 6.015122 * 0.931494 = ?

Let me compute that exactly.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.015122 * 0.931494 → let's calculate:

0.01 * 0.931494 = 0.00931494.

0.005122 * 0.931494 = ?

0.005 *0.931494=0.00465747.

0.000122 *0.931494= approx 0.0001134.

So 0.00465747 +0.0001134= 0.00477087.

So total for 0.015122 *0.931494 is 0.00931494 +0.00477087=0.01408581.

So m =5.588964 +0.01408581=5.60304981 GeV/c².

So m is approximately 5.60305 GeV/c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m = 3.57142857 * 5.60305 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.60305 =16.80915.

0.57142857 *5.60305 = ?

Let me compute 0.5 *5.60305 =2.801525.

0.07142857 *5.60305 → 5.60305 * 0.07 = 0.3922135; 5.60305 *0.00142857≈ 0.008 (approx 0.00798).

So 0.3922135 +0.00798 = ~0.4002.

So 0.57142857 *5.60305 = 2.801525 + 0.4002=3.201725.

So total E = 16.80915 +3.201725=20.010875 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Option B is 23 GeV, which is higher than my calculation. Option D is about 21.419 GeV.

Hmm, so why is there a discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in computing gamma or mass?

Wait, perhaps the mass is not 6.015122 u but 6.015122 * (1 u in GeV). Let me double-check the conversion factor.

1 u = 931.5 MeV/c² = approximately 0.9315 GeV/c².

Yes, that's correct. So 6.015122 u * 0.9315 GeV/u = ?

Wait, let me compute 6.015122 * 0.9315.

6 *0.9315=5.589.

0.015122 *0.9315= ?

0.01*0.9315=0.009315.

0.005122 *0.9315≈0.004763.

So total is 0.009315 + 0.004763=0.014078.

Adding to 5.589 gives m=5.589 +0.014078=5.603078 GeV/c².

So m is about 5.60308 GeV/c².

So gamma is 3.57142857.

E = 3.57142857 *5.60308 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.60308.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

5.60308 * 3 = 16.80924.

5.60308 * 0.57142857.

So 5.60308 *0.5 =2.80154.

5.60308 *0.07142857.

0.07142857 is 1/14.

So 5.60308 /14 = approx 0.4002.

So 2.80154 +0.4002=3.20174.

So total E=16.80924 +3.20174=20.01098 GeV.

So about 20.011 GeV.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that is 0.12 higher. Maybe the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. No, the problem asks for the energy of the collider, which is usually the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic energy). So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma precisely.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

Gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.5714285714.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for m. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Looking it up (though I can't access external resources), Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.015122 u. So 6.015122 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute 6.015122 × 0.931494.

6 * 0.931494 = 5.588964.

0.015122 * 0.931494.

Compute 0.01 *0.931494=0.00931494.

0.005122 *0.931494.

0.005 *0.931494=0.00465747.

0.000122 *0.931494≈0.0001134.

So 0.00465747 + 0.0001134 = 0.00477087.

So 0.015122 *0.931494 = 0.00931494 + 0.00477087 = 0.01408581.

Total m = 5.588964 + 0.01408581 = 5.6030498 GeV/c².

So E=gamma * m =3.57142857 *5.6030498.

Calculating that:

3.57142857 ×5.6030498.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator approach.

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6030498.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.0030498≈0.01089.

So 2.14285714 +0.01089=2.153747.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153747=20.0108898 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm. So why is my calculated value lower than the option C? Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of the nucleus. Let me think: is the mass of Li-6 really 6.015122 u, or is it 6.015122 amu? Wait, yes, that's correct. So m is correct.

Another possibility is that the problem uses the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) as approximately 0.938 GeV/c², and sums them up without considering the binding energy. So for Li-6, 6 nucleons, each about 0.938 GeV, so 6 *0.938=5.628 GeV/c².

Using this m, E=3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.628= ?

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 ×0.028=0.100.

So 2.14285714 +0.100=2.24285714.

Adding 17.85714285:

17.85714285 +2.24285714=20.100 GeV.

Hmm, so that gives E=20.1 GeV. Which would match option C (20.132 GeV) when rounded to four decimal places.

Wait, but I think the precise calculation earlier with Li-6's actual mass gave me 20.01 GeV, but using the sum of nucleons' mass (without binding energy) gives 20.1 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects me to use the sum of the individual nucleons without considering the mass defect. That could explain why the answer is around 20.1 GeV.

So with m=6 *0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

Compute:

5.628 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.628 ×3.57142857.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.028 *3.57142857≈0.100.

So 2.14285714 +0.100=2.24285714.

Adding to 17.85714285 gives 20.100 GeV.

So E is approximately 20.100 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait but earlier when I used the more precise mass (including binding energy), I got 20.01 GeV. So why the discrepancy?

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the lithium nucleus as the sum of the individual nucleon masses, without the mass defect. That would give a higher E, matching option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

5.628 ×3.57142857.

Breaking it down:

5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.628 ×3.57142857.

0.6 ×3.57142857 = 2.14285714.

0.02 ×3.57142857=0.07142857.

0.008 ×3.57142857=0.02857142856.

Adding these: 2.14285714 +0.07142857=2.21428571 +0.02857142856=2.2428571386.

Total E =17.85714285 +2.2428571386=20.100000 GeV.

So exactly 20.100 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.032 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me think: perhaps the problem refers to the kinetic energy, but no, the question says 'energy of the collider', which is the total energy, not just kinetic. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c or the conversion factor, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass of the lithium nucleus as 6u ×0.9315 GeV/u, leading to m=5.589 GeV/c².

Wait, let's compute that.

m=6u *0.9315 GeV/u=5.589 GeV/c².

So E=gamma * m =3.57142857 *5.589.

Compute that:

3.57142857 ×5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.589.

Compute 3.57142857 ×0.5=1.785714285.

3.57142857 ×0.08=0.2857142856.

3.57142857 ×0.009=0.03214285713.

Adding these: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856=2.07142857 +0.03214285713=2.103571427.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.103571427=19.96071428 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV, which is around 19.96 GeV. That's closer to option A (18.475) and option C (20.132). But 19.96 isn't an option. So perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says 'the energy of the nucleus', perhaps it's referring to the kinetic energy. Let me think: sometimes, colliders are said to have a certain energy per particle, which is the kinetic energy. But I think in particle physics, the energy usually refers to the total energy (kinetic plus rest). Hmm.

Wait, if the energy given is the kinetic energy (K), then the total energy would be E = K + m c². But in that case, K = (gamma -1) m c². So if the options are given as the total energy, that's what I computed earlier. But if the options are the kinetic energy, then that's a different approach.

Wait, the question says, 'the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. I think RHIC's energy refers to the total energy of the ion. So I think the approach with E = gamma m c² is correct.

So, putting it all together, using m=6 u ×0.9315 GeV/u=5.589 GeV, gives about 19.96 GeV, which isn't one of the options. Using m as 6 ×0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV, gives E=20.10 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV).

Wait another angle: perhaps I should use more precise values for gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1-v²/c²)=1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise numbers.

Wait, 0.96 squared is exactly 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714... So no issue there.

Hmm, so perhaps the correct answer is option C)20.132 GeV, and I must have made a miscalculation in the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma using a calculator. Let me compute gamma precisely.

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So no issue there.

Wait, let me check the exact value of the mass of Li-6. I think the exact atomic mass is 6.015122 u. So m =6.015122 u ×0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Calculating 6.015122 *0.931494.

6 *0.931494 =5.588964.

0.015122 *0.931494 = let's compute that precisely.

0.015122 ×0.931494:

= (0.01 + 0.005 + 0.000122) ×0.931494

= 0.01 ×0.931494 =0.00931494

0.005 ×0.931494=0.00465747

0.000122 ×0.931494=0.000113441.

Adding these: 0.00931494 +0.00465747=0.01397241 +0.000113441=0.01408585.

Adding to 5.588964 gives 5.60304985 GeV/c².

So m=5.60304985 GeV/c².

E=gamma *m=3.57142857 *5.60304985.

Let me compute this accurately:

3.57142857 ×5.60304985.

I'll compute this as:

5.60304985 ×3 =16.80914955.

5.60304985 ×0.57142857.

Compute 5.60304985 ×0.5=2.801524925.

5.60304985 ×0.07142857.

Let me compute 5.60304985 ×0.07=0.3922134895.

5.60304985 ×0.00142857= approximately 0.008 (exact: 5.60304985 * 0.00142857 ≈0.007999999998 → ~0.008).

So 0.3922134895 +0.008=0.4002134895.

So 5.60304985 ×0.07142857≈0.4002134895.

Adding that to 2.801524925 gives 3.2017384145.

Total E=16.80914955 +3.2017384145=20.01088796 GeV.

So approximately 20.0109 GeV.

But none of the options are 20.01. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the nucleus as 6 ×0.938 GeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

E=3.57142857 ×5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 ×5.628:

5 ×3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.628 ×3.57142857.

0.6 ×3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.028 ×3.57142857=0.100.

So 2.14285714 +0.100=2.24285714.

Total E=17.85714285 +2.24285714=20.100 GeV.

Which is about 20.10 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's 0.032 GeV higher. Perhaps due to more precise calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 ×5.628 exactly.

Let me compute 5.628 ×3.57142857.

Breakdown:

5.628 ×3 =16.884.

5.628 ×0.57142857.

Compute 5.628 ×0.5=2.814.

5.628 ×0.07142857= approx 5.628 ×0.07=0.394, and 5.628 ×0.00142857=0.00804. So total 0.394 +0.00804=0.40204.

So 0.57142857 times 5.628 is 2.814 +0.40204=3.21604.

So E=16.884 +3.21604=20.10004 GeV.

So 20.10004 GeV is approximately 20.100 GeV. So the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.032 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering that the total energy is twice the kinetic energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem uses the exact gamma value without approximating it as 3.5714.

Let me compute gamma more accurately.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571... exactly.

So perhaps using more precise m and more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the kinetic energy.

Wait, if the problem gives the kinetic energy (K), then K = (gamma -1) m c².

But the question says the energy of the collider, which is the total energy (E), not the kinetic.

Hmm.

If the problem expects the calculation using the sum of the nucleons' masses (without binding energy), the E is approximately 20.10 GeV, which is close to option C (20.132 GeV). So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

But why is there a discrepancy between 20.10 and 20.132? Maybe because of more precise calculations.

Wait, let me compute 3.57142857 ×5.628 exactly.

5.628 ×3.57142857.

Let me compute:

3 ×5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 ×5.628.

Compute 5.628 ×0.5 =2.814.

5.628 ×0.07142857.

0.07142857 is 1/14.

So 5.628 /14 =0.402.

So 2.814 +0.402=3.216.

So total E=16.884 +3.216=20.100 GeV.

Hmm, so same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the exact value of the mass of Li-6 and more precise calculations. Let's see:

m=5.60304985 GeV.

gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 ×5.60304985.

Let me compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 ×5.60304985.

I can write this as 3.57142857 × (5 + 0.6 + 0.00304985).

So,

3.57142857 ×5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 ×0.6=2.142857142.

3.57142857 ×0.00304985≈0.01090909.

Adding these:

17.85714285 +2.142857142=20.0000000 (approx) +0.01090909=20.01090909 GeV.

So about 20.0109 GeV.

Hmm, still not matching option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the exact formula with more precise numbers.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should consider that the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of protons and neutrons, each taken as 0.938 GeV/c². So 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 6 ×0.938=5.628 GeV/c².

So E=3.57142857 ×5.628=20.100 GeV.

Which is option C if the answer is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I have a mistake in the calculation, but I can't see where.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the speed as 0.96c, but I made a mistake in calculating gamma. Let me double-check.

v=0.96c → v²/c²=0.9216 → 1 - v²/c²=0.0784 → sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 → gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV. The slight difference might be due to rounding during the calculation steps. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier, but I can't spot it right now.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( v = 0.96c \), and \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus. The rest mass of Li-6 is calculated using its atomic mass \( 6.015122 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m = 6.015122 \times 0.931494 = 5.60305 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is computed as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

The total energy is then:

\[
E = \gamma m = 3.5714 \times 5.60305 \approx 20.0109 \, \text{GeV}
\]

However, the problem may assume the rest mass of the nucleus is the sum of its nucleons (protons and neutrons) without accounting for the mass defect. Each nucleon has a rest mass of approximately \( 0.938 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), so for Li-6:

\[
m = 6 \times 0.938 = 5.628 \, \text{GeV}/c^2
\]

Using this value of \( m \), the energy becomes:

\[
E = \gamma m = 3.5714 \times 5.628 \approx 20.100 \, \text{GeV}
\]

This result is close to option \( C \) (20.132 GeV). The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup. Given the options, the closest match is:

**Answer: C**
