Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same, right? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. The question also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But wait, how does that affect the observed wavelengths? Because if a star is moving towards us (like blue shift), the observed wavelength would be shorter than the emitted one, and if moving away (red shift), longer. But here, Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s. Hmm, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, meaning that the Doppler effect is causing Star_2's peak to shift, but they still observe the same λ. Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, the question says they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found they are the same. So maybe the observed λ_max for both is the same. But the intrinsic λ_max would depend on their temperatures. Oh, so if Star_2 is moving, its emitted λ_max is different, but because of Doppler shift, the observed λ is same as Star_1's emitted λ.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me write down what I know:

Star_1:
- Radius R1 = 1.5 * R2
- Mass M1 = 1.5 * M2
- Radial velocity v1 = 0 km/s
- Observed λ_max1 = same as Star_2's observed λ_max, which is λ_obs2.

Star_2:
- Radial velocity v2 = 700 km/s
- Observed λ_max2 = same as Star_1's λ_max1.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So observed λ1 = observed λ2. But I need to figure out how their intrinsic temperatures relate, considering their velocities.

Wait, maybe the question is that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So Star_1's emitted peak is λ1 = b / T1, and Star_2's emitted peak is λ2 = b / T2. But due to Doppler shift, the observed λ for Star_2 is λ_obs2 = λ2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) or something like that, depending on whether it's moving towards or away. Wait, but the problem says the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star_1 isn't moving, so its observed λ is λ1 = b / T1. Star_2 is moving with some velocity, so its observed λ is λ_obs2 = λ2 * Doppler factor.

Wait, but the question states that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Since Star_1's λ_obs is λ1 (as it isn't moving), and Star_2's λ_obs is λ2 Doppler shifted.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they found that the wavelengths are the same. So λ1 (emitted by Star_1) = λ_obs2 (which is Star_2's emitted λ multiplied by the Doppler shift factor). So perhaps the observed λ for Star_2 is the same as the emitted λ of Star_1, implying that the temperature of Star_2 can be determined with this shift.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the Doppler effect. Let me think. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Wait, wait, no. The Doppler formula depends on whether the star is moving towards or away. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter than emitted (blue shift). If moving away, longer (red shift). So the formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But I think that's when the source is moving towards the observer at speed v. Wait, no, perhaps the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z), where z is the redshift. And z is approximately v/c when v is much less than c.

Wait, in any case, for small velocities compared to c (which 700 km/s is, since c is about 3e5 km/s), the approximation z ≈ v/c can be used, so the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). But wait, if the star is moving away, v is positive, so λ_obs increases (redshift). If moving towards us, v is negative, so λ_obs decreases (blueshift).

So, let me think. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. But the problem doesn't specify direction, so perhaps I need to assume it's moving towards us, but I'm not sure. Wait, the problem says radial velocity is 700 km/s. Radial velocity is positive when moving away, negative when moving towards. Wait, no, actually, I think the convention is that radial velocity is positive when moving away. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700 km/s, it's moving away, so observed λ would be longer than emitted. So let me keep that in mind.

But wait, the question says that the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So Star_1's emitted λ is λ1, and Star_2's emitted λ is λ2. But because Star_2 is moving, the observed λ for Star_2 is λ2 * (1 + v2/c), assuming it's moving away. So if observed λ is same for both, then λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c).

But wait, Star_1's λ1 is given by the blackbody formula: λ1 = b / T1. Similarly, Star_2's λ2 = b / T2.

So from λ1 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c), substituting λ1 = b/T1 and λ2 = b/T2, we get:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

The b's cancel out, so:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

=> T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

But wait, I'm not sure if I should be using the approximation here. Because 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, and c is 3e8 m/s, so v/c is approximately 0.002333... So (1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333.

But perhaps the formula is more accurately written as (1 + z) = sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), but that's for relativistic speeds, which 700 km/s is not. So the approximation is probably sufficient. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving away at speed v is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c). So if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. But the problem states that the observed λ_max from Star_2 is the same as that from Star_1.

So, for Star_1: λ1 = b/T1 (since v1 = 0, so no Doppler shift)

For Star_2: λ_obs2 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ1

But λ2 = b/T2, so:

λ1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

But λ1 = b/T1, so:

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again. If the star is moving away, the observed λ is longer, so the observed temperature would be lower, because λ is inversely proportional to T. So if Star_2 is moving away, T_obs would be lower than T_emit. But Star_1's T is T1, and the observed λ_max is same as Star_2's observed, which would imply that the temperature measured for Star_2 is lower than its actual temperature.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it by considering the observed temperatures. The observed temperature from Star_2 would be T_obs2 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). Because if a star is moving away, it's redshifted, so the observed temperature is lower.

Similarly, the observed temperature from Star_1 is T1, since v1=0.

But wait, the problem states that the observed λ_max are the same, so the observed temperatures would be the same. Because λ_max is related to T by λ_max = b / T.

So,

T_obs1 = T_obs2

But T_obs1 is T1 (since Star_1 is not moving), and T_obs2 is T2 / (1 + v2/c), because the star is moving away, which causes a redshift, lowering the observed T.

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c)

Then,

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. If the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so T_obs is lower. So T_obs2 = T2 / (1 + v2/c). So if the observed T is same as T_obs1, which is T1, then T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c), which implies T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

But now, I need to find the luminosities of the two stars.

The luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴

So L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

We're told R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1 = 1.5 R2 => R2 = R1 / 1.5

So,

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T1⁴ = 4π (2.25 R2²) σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

Now, the ratio L1/L2 is:

(2.25 R2² σ T1⁴) / (R2² σ T2⁴) ) = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4

But from earlier, we have T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c). Wait, no, earlier equation is T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c), so T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v2/c)

So,

(L1/L2) = 2.25 * [1/(1 + v2/c)]^4

Now, compute (1 + v2/c). v2 is 700 km/s.

v2 = 700,000 m/s

c = 3e8 m/s = 300,000,000 m/s

v2/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/(3e5) = 7/(300,000) ≈ 0.000023333...

Wait, 700,000 divided by 3e8 is 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) = 7/3000 ≈ 0.0023333...

Wait, 700,000 is 7e5, and 3e8 is 300 million, so yeah, 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) = 0.002333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1 + 0.002333... = 1.002333...

So,

(1/(1 + v2/c))^4 = (1/1.002333...)^4 ≈ (0.9976805...)^4

Let me compute that.

First, compute (1/1.002333) ≈ 0.9976805.

Now, compute 0.9976805^4.

I can approximate this using the binomial expansion for small x. Let me let x = 1/1.002333 = 0.9976805.

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to compute ln(0.9976805) and then exponentiate.

Compute ln(0.9976805) ≈ -0.00233.

Because ln(1 - x) ≈ -x for small x. Here, 1 - x = 0.9976805 => x ≈ 0.0023195.

So ln ≈ -0.0023195.

Multiply by 4: 4 * (-0.0023195) = -0.009278.

So e^(-0.009278) ≈ 1 - 0.009278 + (0.009278)^2/2 ≈ 0.99075.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute (1.002333)^4 and then take the reciprocal.

Wait, 1.002333^4.

Let me compute (1 + x)^n where x=0.002333, n=4.

Using binomial approximation:

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 +4x + 6x² +4x^3 +x^4

x=0.002333, so x^2 = 5.44e-6, x^3=1.26e-8, x^4=2.96e-10.

So,

4x ≈ 0.009332

6x² ≈6 *5.44e-6 = ~3.26e-5

4x^3 = 4*(1.26e-8) = ~5.04e-8

x^4=2.96e-10

Summing up:

1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332

+ 0.0000326 → 1.0093646

+ 0.0000000504 → 1.00936465

Negligible further terms.

So 1.002333^4 ≈ ~1.00936465.

So 1/(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1/1.00936465 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, but using the reciprocal: 1.00936465 is approximately 1.009365, so 1/1.009365 is about 0.9907.

So,

(L1/L2) ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9907:

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814

0.25 * 0.9907 = 0.247675

Sum: 1.9814 + 0.247675 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

So 2.229 is closest to option D: ~2.23.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, let me recompute (1.002333)^4 accurately.

Another approach: compute 1.002333^2 first.

1.002333 * 1.002333.

= 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2

= 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544

≈ 1.00467144

Now, square that to get 1.00467144^2.

= (1 + 0.00467144)^2

= 1 + 2*0.00467144 + (0.00467144)^2

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182

≈ 1.0093647

So 1.002333^4 ≈ 1.0093647

So 1/(1.0093647) ≈ 0.9907.

So,

2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229, which is approximately 2.23.

So the answer should be option D, ~2.23.

To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we analyze the given data and apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Radius of Star_1: \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \)
   - Mass of Star_1: \( M_1 = 1.5 \, M_2 \)
   - Radial velocities: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, \, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Observed peak wavelengths: \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)

2. **Temperature Relationship**:
   - The peak wavelength of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its temperature: \( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \), where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant.
   - Since the observed peak wavelengths are the same (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)), the Doppler effect must be accounted for. For Star_2, the observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
     \]
   - Using the approximation for small \( v_2/c \) (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s}, \, c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \)), the Doppler factor simplifies to:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \approx \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
     \]
   - Equating the observed wavelengths for both stars:
     \[
     \lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \cdot (1 + v_2/c)
     \]
   - Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = b / T \), we find:
     \[
     T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_2/c)
     \]

3. **Luminosity Ratio**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
   - For Star_1 and Star_2:
     \[
     L_1 = 4 \pi R_1^2 \sigma T_1^4, \quad L_2 = 4 \pi R_2^2 \sigma T_2^4
     \]
   - The ratio of luminosities is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
     \]
   - Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2 \) and \( T_1 = T_2 / (1 + v_2/c) \):
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{(1.5)^2}{(1 + v_2/c)^4}
     \]
   - Compute \( 1 + v_2/c \):
     \[
     v_2/c = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333, \quad 1 + v_2/c \approx 1.002333
     \]
   - Raise \( 1.002333 \) to the fourth power:
     \[
     (1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009365
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{2.25}{1.009365} \approx 2.23
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times greater than that of Star_2.
