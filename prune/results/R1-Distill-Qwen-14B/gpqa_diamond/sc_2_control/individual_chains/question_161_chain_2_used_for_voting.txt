Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in a transmission electron microscope. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So Mike designed this high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr, which is super low, right? But even then, some gas molecules are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I remember that. He based λ1 on factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature. But then, when he turned on the electron beam, he noticed something interesting. The mean free path changed to λ2, even though the temperature didn't change. So why would λ2 be different?

Wait, the question asks what conclusion we can draw about λ2 based on this scenario. The options are A to D.

I think the key here is understanding how the mean free path changes under different conditions. The mean free path λ is given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density of the gas, and d is the average diameter of the molecules. But wait, sometimes I've also heard it in terms of pressure and other variables. Oh right, another formula for mean free path in a gas is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and P is pressure. Or more commonly, λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * n), since n is the number density.

Wait, another way to write it is λ = (1)/(n * π * d²) * (1/√2) perhaps? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I know that λ is inversely proportional to the pressure and the square of the molecular diameter, and directly proportional to the temperature. Since the temperature didn't change, T is the same in both cases.

But in the scenario, when the electron beam is on, does anything change? Well, the electron beam is high-energy—1000 kV is a lot. So the electrons are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, but how does that affect the gas molecules?

I think the main effect is that the high-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or get excited. Or perhaps the electrons can knock gas molecules out of the vacuum by impacting them. Wait, but the electrons are moving through the vacuum, and the gas is at a low pressure. So the electrons are going to interact with the gas molecules. If the gas is present, the electrons can scatter off them, which would affect the electron beam. But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. The mean free path in this context is about the gas molecules in the vacuum. So when Mike turned on the electron beam, does this affect the gas?

Hmm, another thought: the mean free path of gas molecules is determined by how often they collide with each other. If the electron beam introduces other factors, like ionization or heating, but the temperature is the same. Wait, but the sample compartment's temperature is the same, so thermal effects on gas molecules' speed might not change.

Wait, but when the electron beam is on, it's a high-energy beam. Could it cause gas molecules to be accelerated or ionized, thus altering their motion? If the gas molecules are ionized, they'd have an electric charge. Charged particles would behave differently in the vacuum—perhaps they would be more likely to be affected by the electric fields in the microscope. But wait, the mean free path is about their movement relative to each other. If they're charged, would that change things?

Alternatively, think about the mean free path as being affected by the presence of the electron beam. The electrons are moving at high speeds and have a lot of energy. The gas molecules are in the path of the electrons. When the electrons pass through, they might collide with the gas molecules more frequently. Thus, the gas molecules' mean free path would change.

Wait, but wait—the mean free path λ is about how far a gas molecule travels before colliding with another gas molecule. The presence of the electron beam might cause the gas molecules to have more interactions with the electrons, but if the electrons are moving quickly, maybe the gas molecules don't have time to collide with each other as much. Or perhaps the electron beam's presence might cause more scattering of the gas molecules, leading to more frequent collisions, thus reducing their mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe when the electron beam is on, it heats the gas molecules. But the problem states that the temperature of the sample compartment remained the same, so any heating effect is negligible. So the temperature is the same, so the mean free path based on thermal motion is the same. But why would λ2 change then?

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile or perhaps to move faster, but that would require an increase in temperature. Since the temperature is the same, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing some of the gas molecules to be pumped out, or perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be ionized, and thus they stick to the walls more because they're charged, thereby reducing the pressure. Wait, but the initial setup was already under ultra-high vacuum. So if the electron beam somehow causes gas molecules to stick to the walls or other surfaces, the number of gas molecules in the compartment would decrease, leading to lower pressure. Lower pressure would increase the mean free path because mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure.

Wait, but the initial pressure was already less than 1e-9 Torr, which is quite low. If the electron beam somehow causes more gas molecules to be removed (like pumping them out), the pressure would drop further. So n would decrease, and since λ is inversely proportional to n, λ would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. Because λ1 was determined under the vacuum state without the electron beam, and when the beam is on, perhaps the pressure is lower, making λ2 larger.

So that would mean λ2 is greater than λ1. So looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. So an increase by a factor of over 1.22.

Option D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 * λ1. So a smaller increase.

If the pressure is lower, then λ2 is higher than λ1. So which is correct?

Wait, but why would the pressure decrease when the electron beam is on? Because the electron beam is a high-energy beam. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to be ionized. Ionized gas molecules (ions) might be more likely to be captured by the walls of the vacuum chamber, as charged particles tend to stick more. So the ions would stick to the walls, effectively removing them from the gas phase. So the number of gas molecules in the vapor phase (n) would decrease. As n decreases, the pressure P decreases, since P is proportional to n.

Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is already very low. If n decreases, the pressure P goes down, so the mean free path λ would increase since λ is inversely proportional to P. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So λ2 = λ1 * (P1 / P2). Since P2 < P1 (because some gas is being removed by the beam), λ2 is larger than λ1.

But how significant is this change? If the pressure drops just a little, λ2 would be slightly bigger. If the pressure drops a lot, λ2 would be much bigger.

Wait, but the initial pressure is already ultra-low. So maybe the change in pressure isn't that drastic. But regardless, the mean free path increases. So λ2 > λ1.

Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. So it's possible that λ2 is more than 1.22 times λ1. But does the problem give any clues about how much it changed?

Alternatively, perhaps the electron scattering is causing more interactions. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules is determined in two scenarios: when the vacuum is created (before the beam is on) and when the beam is on. The initial λ1 is calculated under the ultra-high vacuum. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, causing more frequent collisions than before. Wait, but the initial λ1 was determined when the beam wasn't on. So when the beam is on, the gas molecules might have more interactions with the electrons, which are moving through the same space. Could this affect the mean free path of the gas molecules?

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules is about how often they collide with each other. If the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, perhaps they collide with each other more or less often. Alternatively, if the gas molecules are ionized and then accelerated away by the electric fields in the microscope, that would reduce their number (n), leading to a lower pressure and thus a longer mean free path.

So let me think about this scenario. The vacuum is already at a very low pressure. When the beam is on, some of the gas molecules are ionized and get attracted to the walls or other parts of the microscope. So the number of gas molecules in the compartment decreases. That would reduce the pressure. Since mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure (λ ∝ 1/P), the mean free path would increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

So in this case, λ2 is greater than λ1. So looking at the options, which ones say λ2 is greater?

Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 * λ1. So it's either equal or greater.

Option C says λ2 < λ1: No, we think λ2 is greater.

Option D says λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1: So it's between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Option B says λ2 = λ1, which contradicts the observation.

So the options are A or D, depending on how much λ2 has increased.

Wait, the problem states that the mean free path was "no longer equal to λ1". So λ2 is not equal. But how much?

I think that when the electron beam is on, the presence of the beam can cause gas molecules to be removed more effectively, leading to a lower pressure. So the mean free path would increase. So the only options that make sense are A and D.

But the question is, does the mean free path increase by more than 20% (1.22 times) or not?

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure of the exact factors. Wait, 1.22 is approximately the factor from the ideal gas law when considering the square root of two. Wait, in the mean free path formula, λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d² P). So if pressure decreases by a factor of, say, 0.8, λ would increase by 1/0.8 = 1.25, which is about 25% more. So 1.22 is about a 22% increase.

But why would the pressure decrease by that much? If the electron beam is affecting the gas, maybe the pressure isn't dropping by much. Or perhaps the mean free path is only increasing a little.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam actually causes more collisions between gas molecules because the electrons are providing more energy or something, but that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be heated, but the problem says the temperature is the same. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path is determined based on the electron scattering. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the mean free path I'm thinking about is that of the electrons, but the question is about the gas molecules. Let me reread that part.

The question says, "Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules ... to be λ1, ... upon initiating the electron beam, he made an observation concerning the mean free path based on electron scattering with the gas molecules. He found that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; rather, it was λ2."

Wait, so the mean free path is about the gas molecules, but Mike is observing this based on electron scattering. So perhaps the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules, and that changes the effective mean free path from Mike's perspective.

Wait, but the mean free path of the gas molecules is a property of the gas, not of the electrons. So if the gas molecules' mean free path is λ2, which is different from λ1, why would that be?

Hmm, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized, making them charged. Charged particles would have different collision behavior. For instance, two charged particles might repel each other more, leading to fewer collisions and thus a longer mean free path. Alternatively, charged particles might stick to the walls more, which again would decrease the number density, increasing λ.

Wait, if the gas molecules are ionized, they become charged and might be more likely to stick to the walls or other surfaces. So the number density n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 would be larger than λ1. So λ2 > λ1.

So the answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1, which points to options A or D.

But the question is, how much greater? The options are A: >=1.22, D: between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Well, the problem doesn't provide any specific data about how much the pressure changed. But the fact is that the mean free path changes, so the only possible options are A or D. But why would it be either of those?

Wait, another approach: the mean free path for gas molecules is given by λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density.

If the electron beam causes some of the gas molecules to leave the compartment (be pumped out or stick to walls), then n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 = λ1 * (n1 / n2). Because n2 < n1, λ2 > λ1.

But the question is, by how much? Without knowing the exact change in n, I can't say for sure. But the options don't give any other possibilities. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1.

Looking back at the options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1

So, which is it? The scenario says that Mike accurately determined λ1 before the beam was on, and upon starting the beam, he found λ2. So is the change a significant one?

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules doesn't change, but the effective mean free path for the electron beam (which is what Mike was observing) does. Because the electrons are scattering more off the gas molecules, the mean free path for the electrons would be shorter. But wait, the question says he determined the mean free path of the gas molecules. So the gas's own mean free path is λ2, which is different from λ1.

Ah, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being heated, but the problem says the temperature is the same. So that can't be it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized, making them charged, which affects their collision cross-section. For example, if the molecules are charged, perhaps they interact more or less with each other. If the cross-section increases, the mean free path decreases. But Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1, so λ2 could be either higher or lower.

Wait, but does ionization increase or decrease the collision cross-section? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps when gas molecules are ionized, they might have a different effective diameter, perhaps larger. So if d increases, then λ (which is inversely proportional to d squared) would decrease, making λ2 < λ1. But that would imply option C, which is λ2 < λ1.

But earlier reasoning suggested that ionized molecules would leave the compartment, decreasing n and thus increasing λ.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to structure it.

Factors affecting λ2:

1. Number density n decreases (because molecules are being removed by the beam) → λ increases.

2. Collision cross-section (d) changes due to ionization → could increase (if ions are bigger in effective size, perhaps due to charge cloud) or decrease.

But I think that the primary effect is the removal of gas molecules from the compartment, leading to lower n and higher λ. So λ2 > λ1.

So among the options, either A or D.

But the question is, is the change significant enough to make λ2 >=1.22 λ1 or just a small increase.

Well, the problem says that some gas particles remained inside, detected by a mass spectrometer. But when the beam is on, perhaps a significant number are ionized and pumped out. So n could decrease by a considerable amount, leading to a larger λ2. So option A could be correct.

But wait, the problem states that the same sample compartment temperature remained the same. So if the temperature is the same, and n decreased, then λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

So if the initial λ1 is based on the low pressure, and then the pressure becomes even lower when the beam is on, the mean free path would be longer.

So the conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So which option is that?

Options:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 → possible.

D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 → possible.

But without knowing the exact change in pressure, it's hard to choose between A and D.

Wait, maybe the mean free path is determined by the gas's own properties. When the beam is on, the gas's own conditions (like pressure) haven't changed. Wait, but the beam is causing some gas to be removed, so pressure would have changed. So, Mike's initial measurement of λ1 was under vacuum without the beam. Once the beam is on, the pressure is lower, so λ2 is higher.

But why would the pressure change? Because when the beam is on, the gas molecules are being ionized and pumped away. So n decreases, so P = nkT/(R) decreases.

So if P decreases, λ increases. So the change could be significant, making λ2 more than 1.22 times λ1. So option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is not that significant. But I don't have enough information.

So, based on the reasoning that the beam causes gas to be removed, leading to lower pressure and higher mean free path, the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the options are A or D.

But the question also says that when the beam is on, the mean free path is determined based on electron scattering. So perhaps the effective mean free path observed for the electrons is shorter because of more scattering (which would imply more gas present, leading to shorter λ). Wait, no, because if gas is being removed, more free path would mean electrons can go further. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. The mean free path of the gas molecules is a property of the gas. The electron beam's mean free path would be different. But Mike is measuring the gas's mean free path, so that's about the gas's own movement.

If the gas is being removed by the beam, n drops, λ increases. So λ2 is greater than λ1.

So options A and D are possible. Since the question doesn't specify the magnitude, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the only options left are A and D.

But looking at the options, only A and D suggest λ2 is larger. So, which is correct?

In the absence of more data, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the answer is A or D.

Wait, but the options don't have just λ2 > λ1, they have specific multiples.

The formula for mean free path is λ = (k T) / (sqrt(2) π d² P). So if the pressure decreases, λ increases.

Let me think about the scenario. The initial pressure is P1. After the beam is on, pressure becomes P2 < P1. So λ2 = (k T)/(sqrt(2) π d² P2) = λ1 * (P1/P2). Since P2 < P1, λ2 > λ1.

If the pressure drops to, say, 0.8 P1, then λ2 = 1.25 λ1. So that's above 1.22 λ1. So option A would apply.

But how much would the pressure drop? It's hard to say. But the problem says Mike accurately determined λ1, but upon turning on the beam, he found a new λ2. So the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So options A and D are possible.

But since the problem says the temperature remained the same, and the pressure decreased, λ2 must be larger.

So the answer is either A or D.

Wait, but the problem says that Mike found λ2 based on electron scattering. So perhaps the effective mean free path for the electrons is shorter because of more scattering. But that would be the electron's mean free path, not the gas's.

Wait, I'm getting tangled. Another approach: the mean free path of the gas molecules is λ1 initially. When the beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized, so their number density may decrease, increasing λ2. So λ2 is larger than λ1.

Hence, the correct conclusion is λ2 > λ1, which is either A or D.

But without more info, the correct answer would be that λ2 is greater than λ1. So looking at the options, the only one that says λ2 is larger is A and D.

But I'm not certain whether it's by more than 1.22. Maybe the answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more mobile, so their mean free path doesn't change. But that contradicts the observation.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention the gas pressure changing. It's possible that the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be more ionized, which changes the collision cross-section. If the cross-section increases, then λ decreases, making λ2 < λ1. But that would be option C.

Hmm, but earlier reasoning suggested that the gas is being pumped out, which would increase λ.

This is getting complicated. Let me think about real-world considerations. In a TEM, the vacuum is crucial because gas molecules can scatter the electrons. So when the beam is on, any gas present would cause more scattering, which would imply that the electron's mean free path is shorter. But the question is about the gas's own mean free path.

Wait, but the gas's mean free path is a property of the gas, not the electrons. So if the number of gas molecules decreases (n decreases), the gas's mean free path λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

So the correct option is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So among the choices, A and D are possible.

But looking at the options, A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, while D says λ2 is between λ1 and 1.22 λ1.

Which is it? Without specific data, perhaps the correct answer is A, assuming that the pressure drops enough for λ2 to be more than 1.22 times larger.

Alternatively, if the pressure only drops a little, λ2 would be between λ1 and 1.22 λ1, which would be option D.

But in reality, when you turn on a high-energy electron beam in an ultra-high vacuum, does the pressure drop significantly? Well, the pressure was already extremely low, and the electron beam might not drastically change it. So perhaps the change isn't that large. So λ2 would be just a little bigger than λ1, making option D correct.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: the mean free path of gas molecules is given by λ = 1/(n π d²) * sqrt(2). So if n decreases by a factor of, say, 0.9, λ increases by 1/0.9 ≈ 1.11 times. So 1.11 is less than 1.22.

But I'm not sure how much n would decrease. If the electron beam only removes a small fraction of the gas, then n doesn't change much, so λ2 is just a bit larger than λ1, making option D correct. But if a significant portion of the gas is removed, then λ2 would be much larger, making option A correct.

The problem states that the vacuum is already ultra-high, so perhaps n is so low that any further removal by the beam would have a significant effect. So, maybe λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, making option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path doesn't change because the electron beam's presence doesn't affect the gas molecules' density or collision rate. If that's the case, λ2 would equal λ1, but the problem says that it's not the case. So option B is incorrect.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck between options A and D. But given that the problem states that upon initiating the beam, the mean free path changed, it's likely that λ2 is greater than λ1. Without more info, perhaps the most reasonable conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1 but not by a huge margin, so option D.

Wait, but why would the mean free path of the gas molecules change when the electron beam is on? Because the beam is causing the gas to be pumped out, which would decrease n and increase λ.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam increases the rate at which gas molecules collide with the walls, thus reducing the number in the compartment and increasing λ.

But I'm still not entirely sure. Since the question gives the option where λ2 is greater, I think the correct answer is either A or D.

But given that the problem says Mike accurately determined λ1, perhaps the assumption is that the electron beam's presence doesn't significantly alter the pressure, making λ2 only slightly larger than λ1. So option D.

Wait, but I don't have enough information to make that assumption. Another approach: the mean free path in a vacuum is given by λ = (3/√2) * (k*T)/(π d² P). So if the pressure P decreases, λ increases.

But in the case of the electron beam, perhaps the gas is being heated, increasing T, but the problem states that the temperature remained the same.

Hmm. At this point, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So among the options, A and D are possible.

Since the question states that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1, we can eliminate option B. So the possible answers are A, C, D.

But earlier reasoning suggests that λ2 is greater than λ1, so option C is out. So the choice is between A and D.

Perhaps the answer is A, λ2 >= 1.22 λ1.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path depends on the effective cross-section, and when the gas is ionized, the cross-section increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

If that's the case, then option C would be correct.

But why would the cross-section increase upon ionization? Maybe because charged particles might have a larger effective radius. So when gas molecules are ionized, their effective diameter d increases, so λ decreases.

If that's the case, then λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, perhaps the ionization causes the gas to stick to the walls, decreasing n and thus increasing λ.

So I'm torn between options A and C.

But given the problem's setup, where the mean free path changes, I think the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, making options A or D correct.

But without knowing the exact change, I'll go with option C, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path doesn't change because the temperature is fixed, and the beam's presence doesn't change the pressure enough. But the problem says the mean free path changed.

Another angle: mean free path is calculated as λ = (1.38e-23 m^2 kg/s^2 K) * T / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P)

But if the pressure P drops, λ increases.

So in conclusion, I think the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct options are A and D. But since the question doesn't provide the magnitude, perhaps the answer is A, assuming the pressure drops enough.

Wait, but the problem states that Mike connected the pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, and some gas remained. So when the electron beam is on, perhaps some of the gas is removed, making P even lower. So λ2 (mean free path) would be longer, making λ2 > λ1.

So the options are A or D.

But the question says that upon initiating the beam, the mean free path is no longer equal to λ1. So the mean free path must have changed. So the correct answer is either A or D.

I think the intended answer is that the mean free path increases, so λ2 > λ1. So the options are A and D.

But since the question doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct option is A: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.

Wait, but that's just a guess. Another thought: perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules is determined based on the electron scattering. If the electrons are scattering more, that would imply more gas molecules, leading to a shorter mean free path. But that would mean λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

Wait a minute, this is confusing. Let's think again.

Mike is measuring the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons. So if the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are ionized and perhaps pumped out, leading to a lower n and higher λ. So λ2 > λ1.

But if the gas isn't pumped out, but the ionization causes the collisions to be more frequent, then λ2 < λ1.

But I think the dominant effect is the pumping out of the gas, leading to higher λ.

So the correct conclusion is λ2 > λ1.

So the options are A and D.

But the problem doesn't specify how much. Looking back at the options, the options are designed to test knowledge of how the mean free path changes when the pressure changes.

Wait, if the electron beam doesn't affect the gas's number density, then λ remains the same. But the problem says λ changes, so the presence of the beam must be causing a change in the number of gas molecules.

Thus, the mean free path increases. So the correct answer is either A or D.

But without knowing the exact change, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is λ2 < λ1. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the formula.

Mean free path λ = (1) / (n * π * d^2) * (1/√2). So λ is inversely proportional to n.

If the electron beam causes n to increase (unlikely), λ decreases. But if the beam causes n to decrease, λ increases.

But in reality, turning on the electron beam would likely cause n to decrease because gas molecules are being removed via ionization and sticking to the walls.

Thus, λ2 > λ1.

So the correct options are A or D.

But again, without knowing the magnitude, it's hard to choose between A and D.

In the absence of more information, perhaps the intended answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the correct option is A: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are heated, increasing their velocity, which would increase the collision rate and thus decrease the mean free path. But the problem states that the temperature remains the same, so this effect is nullified.

Therefore, the only factor is the change in n. So λ2 > λ1. So the answer is either A or D.

In the end, given the options, I'll have to go with option C being incorrect, and the correct answer being A. But honestly, I'm not 100% sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining how the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) changes when the electron beam is turned on. Initially, the mean free path is λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. Upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2, and the task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding Mean Free Path (λ):**  
   The mean free path of gas molecules is given by the formula:  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \pi d^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]  
   where \( n \) is the number density of gas molecules, \( d \) is the effective diameter of the molecules, and \( \sqrt{2} \) accounts for the collision geometry. Thus, \( \lambda \) is inversely proportional to \( n \), meaning a decrease in \( n \) (number density) leads to an increase in \( \lambda \).

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam:**  
   When the electron beam is turned on, several effects could influence the gas molecules:  
   - **Ionization and Pumping:** High-energy electrons can ionize gas molecules, making them charged. Charged particles are more likely to stick to the walls of the vacuum chamber or be removed from the system, effectively reducing \( n \).  
   - **Temperature:** The problem states that the sample compartment temperature remains constant, so thermal effects on molecular motion are negligible.  

   The dominant effect is likely the removal of gas molecules due to ionization, leading to a decrease in \( n \) and, consequently, an increase in \( \lambda \). Thus, \( \lambda_2 > \lambda_1 \).

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**  
   - **Option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \)):** This suggests a significant increase in the mean free path, potentially due to a substantial reduction in \( n \). If the electron beam removes a considerable fraction of gas molecules, this could occur.  
   - **Option B (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \)):** This contradicts the problem statement, which explicitly states that \( \lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1 \).  
   - **Option C (\( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \)):** This would require an increase in \( n \), which is unlikely given the electron beam's tendency to remove gas molecules.  
   - **Option D (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \)):** This suggests a small increase in \( \lambda \), which could occur if the electron beam removes only a small fraction of gas molecules.  

4. **Conclusion:**  
   The problem does not provide specific data on how much \( n \) decreases, but the electron beam's ionizing effect is expected to reduce \( n \), leading to an increase in \( \lambda \). While the exact magnitude of the increase is uncertain, the most reasonable conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 > \lambda_1 \). Among the options, **Option A** (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \)) aligns with the expectation that the mean free path increases significantly due to the removal of gas molecules.
