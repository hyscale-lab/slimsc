Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector, and I need to compute the uncertainty. The options are given, so I'll need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that the uncertainty of an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator in question. So, here, A is P_z.

Wait, but the system isn't in an eigenstate of P_z. It's in an eigenstate of P_x. So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ might not be zero? Or maybe it is? I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the steps.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is given as the column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I'll need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But wait, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the given state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That's good because working in the eigenbasis can simplify calculations.

Wait, wait. If the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, then each component of the state vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. So, for a state |n⟩ in this basis, P_z |n⟩ = p_n |n⟩, where p_n is the eigenvalue.

So, the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. That means when I calculate ⟨P_z⟩, it's just the weighted average of the eigenvalues, weighted by the square of the amplitudes in each component.

But wait, the state is given as a column vector. So, the components of the vector are the coefficients in the expansion of |ψ⟩ in the P_z eigenbasis. So, each component (the first, second, third) corresponds to the eigenvalues of P_z.

Looking at the matrix of P_z given, it's diagonal. The diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. So, the first diagonal element is ħ, the second is 0, and the third is -ħ. So, the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ.

The state |ψ⟩ is given as (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, is this normalized? Let me check the sum of squares.

Compute (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

So each component in the state vector corresponds to the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue p_i, where p_i is the i-th diagonal element of P_z.

So, the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ. The second component is 1/√2, amplitude for 0. The third is -1/2, amplitude for -ħ.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of |amplitude_i|^2 * p_i.

So, let's compute that. The first term is ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ = (1/4) * ħ. The second term is ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 = (1/2)*0 = 0. The third term is ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ) = (1/4)*(-ħ). So adding these:

(1/4) ħ + 0 + (-1/4) ħ = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. So, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, ⟨P_z²⟩ is the expectation value of P_z squared. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² will be a diagonal matrix with each diagonal element squared. So, the eigenvalues of P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2, which are ħ², 0, and ħ².

So, to find ⟨P_z²⟩, again, it's the sum of |amplitude_i|^2 * (p_i)^2.

So, each term: first is (1/4)* (ħ^2) = ħ²/4. Second is (1/2)*0 = 0. Third is (1/4)* (ħ^2) = ħ²/4. Adding these gives (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2) ħ². And ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

So, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So that's the answer?

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the state vector and the matrix again. The given state is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, in the P_z eigenbasis, each component is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate.

So, the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for eigenvalue ħ. The third is -1/2, amplitude for -ħ. The second is 1/√2 for 0.

So, the probabilities: | -1/2 |² = 1/4, |1/√2|²=1/2, | -1/2 |²=1/4. Correct.

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/4)*(-ħ) = 0. Correct.

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/4)(ħ²) ) = (1/2)ħ². So, yes, correct.

Thus, the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2)ħ² ) = ħ/sqrt(2). So option B is the answer.

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state is given as the column vector $| \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the diagonal entries of the $P_z$ matrix.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 p_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ is the probability of the system being in the eigenstate of $P_z$ with eigenvalue $p_i$. The components of $| \psi \rangle$ are $c_1 = -1/2$, $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c_3 = -1/2$. The probabilities are:

\[
|c_1|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |c_2|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c_3|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ has eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$, corresponding to the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 p_i^2.
\]

Using the probabilities and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4}\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
