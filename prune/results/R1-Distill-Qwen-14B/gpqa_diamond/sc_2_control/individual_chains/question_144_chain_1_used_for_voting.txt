Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me the production energy E_X of 8 GeV, the mass m_X of 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X of 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a really tiny distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ * β, where β is the velocity over the speed of light, and τ is the mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But I should be careful with the units here.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ using Γ. Γ is given in MeV, but I need to convert it to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, actually, no, maybe I should keep it in MeV for the calculation if ħ is in units involving MeV·s. Let's think about units.

2. Calculate the velocity β. To find β, I need to find the speed of the meson. Since the particle is produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass, it's moving relativistically. The energy E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². The rest mass m is 1.2 GeV/c², I think. So γ is E/(m c²). But since c is in there, I need to be careful with units, but perhaps I can find β using E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p is the momentum.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation between energy, mass, and velocity. For a relativistic particle, the energy E is given by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

But I might not need p directly. Let's see, the velocity β is v/c, so β = p c / E. Because, for relativistic particles, p = γ m v, and E = γ m c². So p c = γ m v c, and E = γ m c². So β = (p c) / E. That makes sense.

So first, compute p c. From E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (p c)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. Then p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2).

Wait, but E is given as 8 GeV, which is in units where c=1 usually. Hmm, maybe I should work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but sometimes that complicates things when converting to meters and seconds.

Wait, maybe I should convert everything into SI units. Let me try that.

First, E_X is 8 GeV. 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So E = 8e9 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.2816e-10 J.

m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². To get mass in kg, I need to convert GeV to joules and divide by c squared. c is approximately 3e8 m/s, so c² is 9e16 m²/s².

So m = (1.2e9 eV) * 1.602e-19 J/eV / (9e16 m²/s² * (3e8 m/s)^2 )) Wait, wait. Wait, 1 GeV/c² is (1e9 eV)/(c²). But wait, eV is energy, so when divided by c², gives mass in kg.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me compute m more carefully.

1 GeV = 1e9 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So m_X = 1.2 GeV/c² = (1.2e9 eV) * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (c²) → m = (1.2e9 * 1.602e-19 J) / (c²).

But J is kg·m²/s², so J/(m²/s²) ) → kg.

So m = (1.2e9 * 1.602e-19) / (9e16) kg.

Let me compute that:

1.2e9 → 1.2 * 10^9.

1.602e-19 → 1.602 *10^-19.

Multiply them: 1.2 *1.602 = 1.9224 → 1.9224e-10.

Divide by 9e16 → 1.9224e-10 / 9e16 = (1.9224 /9) * 1e-26 = approx 0.2136 *1e-26 → 2.136e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me double-check:

1.2e9 * 1.602e-19 = 1.2 *1.602=1.9224 → 1.9224e(9-19) = 1.9224e-10.

Divide by c²=9e16 → (1.9224e-10)/(9e16) = (1.9224/9) *1e-26 → 0.2136e-26 → 2.136e-27 kg.

Yes, so m_X ≈ 2.136e-27 kg.

E is 8 GeV, which is 8e9 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 1.2816e-10 J.

Now, compute the momentum p c. From E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

Compute E^2: (1.2816e-10 J)^2 → (1.2816)^2 ≈ 1.642 → 1.642e-20 J².

(m c²)^2: m is 2.136e-27 kg, c² is 9e16 m²/s².

m c² = (2.136e-27 kg) * (9e16 m²/s²) = 1.9224e-10 J.

So (m c²)^2 = (1.9224e-10 J)^2 → approx (1.9224)^2 ≈ 3.697, so 3.697e-20 J².

So (p c)^2 = 1.642e-20 - 3.697e-20 = negative? Wait, that can't be. Oh wait no, E is 8 GeV, which is way larger than m c² which is 1.2 GeV c², so E² should be larger than (m c²)^2.

Wait, no, wait a second. Oh, because E is 8 GeV, and m c² is 1.2 GeV, so E² is (8 GeV)^2 and (m c^2)^2 is (1.2 GeV)^2. So E² is way bigger than (m c²)^2, so (p c)^2 is positive.

Wait, but when I computed E^2 and (m c²)^2 in J^2, I think I messed up. Because E is 8 GeV, which is 8e9 eV, and m c² is 1.2 GeV. So when I compute (m c²)^2 in J², I need to calculate it correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation with E and m c² in the same units, maybe in GeV. Because when E is given in GeV, and m in GeV/c², perhaps it's easier to compute p c in GeV units.

Wait, another approach: in natural units (ħ=c=1), E in GeV, m in GeV/c² is the same as GeV, because c=1. So, in natural units, E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²).

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p = sqrt(8^2 - (1.2)^2) GeV.

Compute that: 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44, so 64 -1.44=62.56. Square root of 62.56 is about 7.91 GeV.

So p = 7.91 GeV/c. So p c is 7.91 GeV. Because when you multiply p (GeV/c) by c (m/s), you get GeV * (m/s) / (m/s) )? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, p in GeV/c, so p c is (GeV/c) * c = GeV. So, p c is 7.91 GeV.

So β is (p c)/E → 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875.

So β ≈ 0.98875.

Now, for the lifetime τ. I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, actually, Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ.

Wait, Γ is the total decay width; the uncertainty in energy is Γ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But I need to get the units right.

Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV: 0.32 GeV.

So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But ħ is Planck's constant over 2π. Let me get the value in J·s.

ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV. 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J, so Γ = 0.32 *1.602e-10 J → approx 5.1264e-11 J.

So τ = ħ / Γ → (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ≈ approx 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, that makes sense? Because higher Γ means shorter lifetime, which aligns with this.

Now, the distance is c * τ * β.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So distance = 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s * 0.98875.

Let me compute that step by step.

3e8 * 2.057e-24 = (3 *2.057) * 1e-16 = 6.171e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.171e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ about 6.105e-16 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest options are A)5.0223e-16, B)4.0655e-15, C)5.0223e-15, D)4.0655e-16.

Hmm, my calculation got about 6e-16 m, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the calculations.

First, let's recalculate the velocity β.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

In natural units, E² = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2 → (p c)^2 = E² - m² c^4 → but since we're in GeV and c=1, it's E² = p² c^2 + m² c^4 → (p c)^2 = E² - m² c^4. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of GeV and c=1, so p c = sqrt(E² - m²).

So yes, pc = sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = approx 7.91 GeV.

So β = (p c) / E = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

That's correct.

Now, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ in J is 0.32 * 1.602e-10 J → 5.1264e-11 J.

Then τ = ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = 2.057e-24 s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So distance = c * τ * β = 3e8 * 2.057e-24 * 0.98875.

Compute 3e8 * 2.057e-24 = 6.171e-16.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.171e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ approx 6.103e-16 m.

But this isn't matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the velocity. Maybe using relativistic equations properly is important. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps using the relativistic relation for the mean path length. There's a formula I might be forgetting.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = c * τ * β γ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Because β γ is the factor that comes from time dilation. Because the proper lifetime is τ, so the observed lifetime is γ τ, so the distance is c * γ τ * β.

Which is the same as c * τ * β γ.

Wait, right, because the lifetime is longer by gamma, so the moving particle's lifetime is gamma times longer. So the decay length is c * gamma tau * beta.

But gamma is E/(m c²), since E = gamma m c².

So gamma = E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV and m c² is 1.2 GeV, gamma =8/1.2 ≈6.6667.

So L = c * tau * beta * gamma.

Wait, but earlier I used beta = 0.98875, gamma is 6.6667.

So let's recalculate tau.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = hbar / (Gamma) → but units should be correct.

Wait, in natural units (GeV and seconds), maybe I should express hbar in GeV·s.

Because hbar is 6.5823e-25 GeV·s.

Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and hbar is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So in GeV·s: 1.0545718e-34 J·s = 1.0545718e-34 / (1.602e-10) GeV·s ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So hbar ≈6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = hbar / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds.

So, same as before.

Now, L = c * tau * beta * gamma.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So compute each term:

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau =2.0569e-24 s.

beta = 0.98875.

gamma = 8 /1.2 ≈6.6667.

So L=3e8 * 2.0569e-24 * 0.98875 *6.6667.

Let me compute step by step.

First, 3e8 * 2.0569e-24 = 6.1707e-16.

Multiply by 0.98875: 6.1707e-16 *0.98875 ≈6.105e-16.

Multiply by 6.6667: 6.105e-16 *6.6667 ≈4.07e-15 meters.

Wait, that's about 4.07e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

So 4.07e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but why the discrepancy in my earlier calculation when I didn't include gamma? Oh because I forgot to include the gamma factor in the decay length. So the initial approach was wrong because I didn't account for time dilation correctly. So the correct formula uses gamma and beta, which gives a longer distance.

So the correct calculation gives around 4.07e-15 m, which is option B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime,
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \) (Mean Lifetime)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the total decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck's constant) is approximately \( 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \) (Velocity as a Fraction of \( c \))
The velocity \( \beta \) is given by:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E}
\]

where \( p c \) is the momentum-energy term. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2
\]

we solve for \( p c \):

\[
(p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2
\]

Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
(p c)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 \, \text{GeV}^2
\]

\[
p c = \sqrt{62.56} \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \gamma \) (Lorentz Factor)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2}
\]

Substituting \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Decay Length \( L \)
Substituting all values into the formula for \( L \):

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma
\]

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 0.98875 \cdot 6.6667
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Next, multiply by \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.98875 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.6111.
\]

\[
L = 6.1707 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.6111 \approx 4.07 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest option to \( 4.07 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B
