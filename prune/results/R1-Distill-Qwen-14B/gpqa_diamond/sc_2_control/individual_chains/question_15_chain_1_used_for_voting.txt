Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

The question says that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. They have the same masses, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii because the Planet_2's host is slightly evolved (so maybe it hasn't expanded much yet), but Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the orientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_planet / R_star)) ), but I might be mixing that up. Or is it more about the orbital inclination?

Oh right, the transit probability (P) is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s)) )? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. Oh wait, another way: the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s) )? Or is it that the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 and also depends on the orbital distance. Or maybe it's more about the relative size of the orbit.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p)) ), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is about (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), because the chance the planet's path crosses our line of sight depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), because a_p is the semi-major axis, which in this case, since the orbits are circular, it's the distance from the star. So a_p is the orbital radius.

Wait no, I think the exact formula for transit probability is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, another source I remember says the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a_p / R_s)) )? Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p) )?

Wait, more accurately, the probability P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), because a_p is the distance from the star, so a_p = R_s * (semi-major axis in terms of R_s? No, wait: the semi-major axis a_p is in astronomical units or some other unit, but the probability depends on how likely the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on with our line of sight.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more likely to align edge-on. The formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a_p / R_s) times some factor, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability can be approximated as (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(a_p^2 - R_s^2)) ) or something like that, but that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps a different angle. The transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance. The formula I found once is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(a_p / R_s) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / (R_s * AU)) ), but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), because a_p is in units of R_s. So if a_p >> R_s, then a_p / R_s is large, making the probability small. That makes sense because if the planet is far from the star, the chance of it passing in front is lower.

Wait, so let's model it. For a given star, the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_p / R_s) ), assuming a_p is much larger than R_p and R_s. So simplifying that, P ≈ (R_p^2) / (R_s^2) * (R_s / a_p) ) = (R_p^2 * R_s) / (a_p R_s^2) ) = (R_p^2) / (a_p R_s).

Wait, but wait another thought. I think the correct formula for the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a_p ), because the relative size of the orbit affects the chance. So P ≈ (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (R_s / a_p) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a_p).

Alternatively, I found a source that says the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/( (a_p / R_s) )) ), which is (R_p^2)/(R_s^2) * R_s/(a_p) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a_p). So that's the same as P = (R_p^2)/(R_s a_p).

Wait, but in this problem, the planets have the same masses. But the RV method gives the minimum mass, but since both have the same mass, that part is equal. But for the transit probability, mass might not matter directly. It matters for the orbital period and the star's mass, but perhaps not the planet's mass.

Wait, so the key variables are R_p (planet radius), R_s (star radius), and a_p (planet's orbital radius). So, for each planet, we can compute P as (R_p^2)/(R_s a_p).

But wait, in the question, the two planets have the same mass, but their host stars have different masses but same radii. So, R_1 = R_2 because both host stars have same radii. So R_s is the same for both.

But what about a_p, the planet's orbital radius? For that, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period (P) to the semi-major axis (a_p). The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M_s + M_p)) ) a_p^3. But since M_p << M_s, we can approximate as P² = (4π²/(G M_s)) a_p^3.

So, a_p^3 = G M_s P^2 / (4 π²). So a_p = [ (G M_s P²) / (4 π²) ]^(1/3).

But since we're comparing a_p for the two planets, we can take the ratio a1 / a2.

Given that Planet_1 has a period P1 = P2 / 3 (since P1 is three times shorter than P2, so P1 = P2 /3). And the host of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host.

So, let's compute the ratio a1/a2.

a1^3 = (G M1 P1^2 )/(4 π² )

a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2 )/(4 π² )

Divide a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2 )

But M1 = 2 M2, so M1/M2=2.

P1 = P2 /3, so P1^2 = (P2^2)/9.

So (a1/a2)^3 = 2 * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

Therefore, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of (0.222) ≈ about 0.606. So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Alternatively, if a2 is larger than a1, because a_p is proportional to (M_s * P^2 )^(1/3). Since M1 is higher but P1 is lower, the effect on a_p depends on which factor is stronger.

Wait, let's compute it numerically. Suppose M1=2, M2=1. P1=1, P2=3.

Then a1^3 = (2) * (1)^2 = 2.

a2^3 = (1) * (3)^2 = 9.

So a1^3 = 2, a2^3=9 → a1/a2= cube root(2/9) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a_p for Planet_1 is about 0.606 times a_p for Planet_2.

Now, back to the transit probability. P = R_p^2 / ( R_s a_p )

But R_p is the same for both planets (since both are Earth-like, same mass, same radius? Wait, the question says they're Earth-like, but does that imply same radius? Probably, yes, as Earth's mass and radius are similar. So R_p1 = R_p2.

R_s is same for both.

So the transit probability for each planet is inversely proportional to a_p.

So P1/P2 = ( (R_p1^2)/(R_s a1) ) / ( (R_p2^2)/(R_s a2) )

Since R_p1 = R_p2 and R_s same, this becomes (1/a1) / (1/a2 ) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, then a2/a1 ≈ 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 ≈ 1.65.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability, about 1.65 times Planet_2's.

Wait, but wait. The question says that the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but both have the same R_s. So which one has higher a_p?

Wait, in the case of a_p for Planet_1: since its period is shorter and host is more massive, a_p for Planet_1 is smaller than that of Planet_2.

So, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a_p, so smaller a_p → higher probability.

Because in the formula, P is proportional to 1/a_p. So if a1 is smaller than a2, then P1 is larger.

So in our case, a1 is about 0.6 a2, so P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher than that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should prefer Planet_1 for observation because it has a higher transit probability.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which is way higher than our calculation.

Wait, but wait, did I get the ratio right?

Because I thought a1 = 0.606 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1.65, which is P1/P2 = 1.65.

So P1 is 1.65 × P2. So Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability is higher.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Because I'm a bit unsure if I computed the a_p correctly.

We have:

a1^3 = G M1 P1²/(4 π²)

a2^3 = G M2 P2²/(4 π²)

Taking the ratio:

(a1/a2)^3 = (M1/M2) * (P1/P2)^2

M1 is 2 M2, P1 is (1/3) P2.

So (2) * ( (1/3) )² = 2*(1/9) = 2/9.

Cube root of 2/9 is approximately 0.606, so a1 = 0.606 a2.

Thus, a1 is smaller than a2, so P1 = (R_p^2)/(R_s a1) → higher than P2.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C, which states that Planet_1 is preferred because it has about 1.65 times higher probability.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P \propto \frac{R_p^2}{R_s a_p}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a_p \) is the planet's orbital radius. The key variables are \( a_p \), which depends on the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_s \), and the transit probability, which is inversely proportional to \( a_p \).

### Step 1: Orbital Radius Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a_p \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the host star's mass \( M_s \) as:

\[
a_p^3 \propto M_s P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

The ratio of their orbital radii is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{1 \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 orbits closer to its host star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a_p \), so:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1. This corresponds to option C, which states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
