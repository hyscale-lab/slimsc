Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids, depending on their form.

So, the general form for a metric in 2D is usually something like ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), but here it's written in terms of x and y. Maybe it's better to switch to polar coordinates because x² + y² = r² would make things easier. Let me try that substitution. So, x² + y² = r², so the denominator becomes 4 - r².

Wait, the metric then becomes ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, that looks like a metric for a surface of constant curvature. Oh right! The metric for a sphere in 2D is something like (R²)/(1 + (r²)/(4R²)) ) or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I think the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a hyperboloid) might have a similar form but with a negative curvature.

Wait, another thought: the standard metric for a surface with constant curvature is usually given in terms of radius. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in polar coordinates is ds² = (a²/(1 + (r²)/(4a²)))² (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Maybe it's more like ds² = (a² / (1 ± (r²)/(a²)))² (dr² + r² dθ²), where the plus is for a sphere and the minus for a hyperboloid (pseudosphere). Or perhaps the other way around? Because if you have a positive denominator, like 1 + (r²)/(a²), that would mean the radius is getting scaled as you move out, but for a sphere, the scaling would be different.

Wait, our given metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me factor out the 32/(4 - r²) as the function f(r) squared. So f(r)^2 = 32/(4 - r²). So f(r) would be sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

Wait, but I'm trying to compare to the standard forms. For a sphere of radius a, the metric in polar coordinates is ds² = (a² (1 - r²/a²)^(-1)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, not exactly, because in the standard spherical coordinates, when r approaches a, the metric blows up, which is the horizon for a black hole, but maybe that's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a hyperboloid of one sheet or two sheets. Hyperboloids can have a metric similar to this. Let's think about the metric. The denominator is 4 - r², which suggests that r² <4, so r <2. So the maximum r is 2. That makes me think this is a sphere of radius 2, because r goes from 0 to 2. Wait, but if it's a pseudosphere, which is a hyperboloid, I thought that would allow r to go beyond a certain value. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between the two.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? So in contrast, a sphere has positive curvature. The metric given: when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. That suggests that the surface is cut off at r=2, which could imply a compact surface, like a sphere.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the question, which asks about a pseudosphere. Oh, maybe the metric is for a pseudosphere, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is conformally flat. Because the metric is written as a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²), which in polar coordinates becomes (dr² + r² dθ²) multiplied by the same function. So the surface is conformally equivalent to the flat Euclidean plane. That might be useful.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait. Wait, the variable r here is the coordinate r, not the actual radius of the sphere. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a sphere with a certain radius. Let's think about the standard metric for a sphere of radius a. In polar coordinates, it's often written as ds² = (a²/(1 + (r²)/(a²))^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, no, that's the metric for the surface of a sphere expressed with a radial coordinate that's not the same as the actual radius. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Wait, another approach: the area of a sphere is 4πa², where a is the radius. So if the pseudosphere has radius 2, the area would be 4π(2)^2=16π. But that's for a regular sphere. Wait, but pseudosphere is a hyperboloid, which is non-compact. Wait, but in this metric, r is limited to less than 2 because when r=2, the denominator becomes zero. So the space is only defined for r <2, which makes it a compact surface, perhaps a sphere.

Wait, but the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric is ds²= [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So f(r)^2 =32/(4 -r²) → f(r) = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)).

So the area can be computed using the standard formula for the area in polar coordinates. The area element is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ - g_rθ²) (dθ dr), but in this case, the metric is diagonal (no cross terms), so the area element is just (f(r)^2 r) dr dθ. Wait, no: in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Since the metric is diagonal, det g = (f(r)^2) * (f(r)^2 r²) )? Wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, the metric is ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). So the components are g_rr = f(r)^2, g_θθ = r² f(r)^2, and g_rθ = 0. So the determinant of the metric is g_rr * g_θθ - (g_rθ)^2 = f(r)^4 r². So the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ = f(r)^2 r dr dθ.

So the area A would be the integral over r and θ. θ goes from 0 to 2π, and r goes from 0 to 2 (since the denominator 4 - r² must be positive, so r <2).

So A = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [f(r)^2 r] dr.

Compute f(r)^2: it's 32/(4 - r²). So f(r)^2 r = [32/(4 - r²)] * r.

So A = 2π ∫_0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral.

Let me factor out 32: 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

Then, the integral becomes ∫ [r dr / (4 - r²)] = ∫ ( -du/2 ) / u = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du = (-1/2) ln |u| + C.

So, evaluating from r=0 to r=2:

At r=2: u=4 - (2)^2=0. So when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0.

At r=0: u=4.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0 of (-1/2) (1/u) du.

Wait, that's (-1/2) [ ln u ] from 4 to 0.

So when r approaches 2, u approaches 0. So the lower limit is u=0, upper limit is u=4.

Wait, let me re-express the integral in terms of u.

The substitution is u = 4 - r², so when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral ∫ (r=0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [ (-1/(2)) (1/u) ) du ]

Wait, actually, since the substitution gives us dr = - du/(2r), but since u =4 -r², r dr = -(du)/2.

Wait, let me re-do the substitution.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r dr / (4 - r²)} ] = ∫ ( -du/2 ) / u → ∫ (-1/(2u)) du.

The limits when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral is from u=4 to u=0, but the substitution gives us:

∫_{4}^{0} [ (-1/(2u)) du ] = ∫_{4}^{0} (-1/(2u)) du.

But integrating from a higher limit to a lower limit can be converted by swapping limits and removing the negative sign.

So, ∫_{4}^{0} (-1/(2u)) du = ∫_{0}^{4} (1/(2u)) du.

So, ∫ (1/(2u)) du from 0 to 4.

But wait, integrating 1/u gives ln u. So evaluating from 0 to 4:

(1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to 4 → (1/2) ( ln 4 - ln 0 )

But ln 0 is negative infinity, so this would lead to the integral diverging to infinity.

Hmm, that's a problem because the integral doesn't converge. So the area A is 32 * 2π * [divergent integral], which suggests that the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait. The original integral is from r=0 to 2. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, when r approaches 2, u approaches zero. So the upper limit in the u substitution is 0, lower limit is 4.

Wait, the integral ∫_{u=4}^{0} (-1/(2u)) du → becomes ∫_{4}^{0} (-1/(2u)) du = ∫_{0}^{4} (1/(2u)) du.

Wait, no. Let me think again: when you change variables, the integral ∫_{a}^{b} f(u) du becomes ∫_{u(a)}^{u(b)} f(u) du. So in our case, when r=0, u=4 → lower limit; when r=2, u=0 → upper limit.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^{u=0} (-1/(2u)) du.

Which is the same as ∫_{4}^{0} (-1/(2u)) du = (1/2) ∫_{0}^{4} (1/u) du. Because flipping the limits removes the negative sign.

But ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to 4 is divergent because as u approaches 0, ln u approaches negative infinity. So the integral is divergent, leading to the area being infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the surface described by the metric is only defined for r < 2. So when r approaches 2, the metric blows up, which would imply that the surface ends at r=2. So perhaps the surface is a sphere with a finite area.

But according to the calculation, the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. But that doesn't make sense for a sphere. Oh wait, but maybe the metric represents something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the area integral. Let me double-check.

The area element in polar coordinates is sqrt(g_rr g_θθ) dr dθ. Since g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So the product is [32/(4 - r²)] * [32 r²/(4 - r^2)] = (32)^2 r² / (4 - r²)^2. The square root of that is 32 r / (4 - r^2).

So the area element is (32 r)/(4 - r^2) dr dθ.

Then A = ∫ (θ from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (r from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr.

Which is 2π ∫ [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2.

Which is 32 * 2π ∫ [r/(4 - r^2)] dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, 32 times 2π is 64 π, but wait, no: 32 *2π is 64 π. No, wait, the 32 is part of the integrand. Oh wait, no, the A is 2π multiplied by the integral of (32 r/(4 -r^2) dr ), so 2π * ∫ [32 r/(4 -r^2) ] dr from 0 to 2.

So, 2π * 32 ∫ [ r/(4 -r^2) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Wait, but earlier substitution showed that the integral diverges, leading to A being infinite.

But that can't be correct because the sphere with r=2 should have a finite area. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the metric is for an infinite surface, but according to the coordinate limits, r goes up to 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a hyperbolic space, which is non-compact and has infinite area. Wait, but the pseudosphere (a hyperboloid) of one sheet is non-compact, which would have infinite area. But the metric given allows r up to 2. So maybe it's a compact hyperbolic space, but I might be getting confused here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the area is 4π times the square of the radius. But the radius given is r=2, so 4π*(2)^2 =16π. But looking at the options, option B is 4π(x² + y²), which doesn't make sense as a constant.

Wait, but the options are given in terms of x and y. Hmm, wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me look again.

The options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

Wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So the area should be a number, but the options B and C have expressions in x and y, which suggests they're dependent on position, which doesn't make sense for an area. So perhaps the correct answer is either A, D, or another option.

Wait, but the metric is defined in terms of x and y, but the area is a global property. So perhaps the area is infinite or zero.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggests the area integral diverges, leading to the area being infinite. So the answer would be D.

But why? Because the pseudosphere is non-compact, so the area is infinite.

Wait, but the metric only allows r up to 2. Does that mean it's compact?

Wait, the metric is ds²=32/(4 -x² -y²) (dx² + dy²).

If we write this in polar coordinates, as we did, r² =x² + y². So the denominator is (4 - r²). So when r approaches 2, the metric blows up. So the space is a 2D surface that is complete only up to r=2. So that suggests that the surface is a sphere of radius 2, but the area calculation seems to be leading to infinity.

Wait, but a sphere's area is finite. So perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the metric is that of a sphere with radius a, and the area can be found by comparing to the known formula.

The standard metric for a sphere of radius a in polar coordinates is:

ds² = (a²/(1 + (r²)/(a²))^2) (dr² + r² dθ²).

Wait, no, that's not correct. The standard metric for a sphere of radius a is often given in terms of spherical coordinates where r is the actual radius. Hmm, perhaps I should think about it differently.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is conformally flat, which means it's equivalent to flat space multiplied by a scaling function. The area element would then be f(r)^2 times the flat area element.

Wait, in the given metric, f(r)^2 =32/(4 - r^2). So the area element is f(r)^2 r dr dθ.

Wait, but earlier integration leads to divergence, implying infinite area. But that can't be for a sphere. So maybe the given metric isn't a sphere but a hyperbolic surface.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric for a pseudosphere in polar coordinates would have a form like ds² = (a²/(1 - r²/a²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), right? Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, the hyperbolic metric in Poincaré coordinates is ds² = (a²/(z²)) (dx² + dy² + dz²), but that's for 3D. In 2D, the metric for hyperbolic space is usually written as ds²= (a²/(1 - r²/a²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, but that's for a hyperboloid, which is a model of hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - r^2), so a^2=4 → a=2. So the metric is ds²=32/(4 - r^2) (dr² + r² dθ²) = (32/(4 - r^2)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me compare to the standard hyperbolic metric.

The standard hyperbolic metric in polar coordinates is ds²= (a²)/(1 - r²/a²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). So if a=2, then denominator would be (1 - r²/4)^2 = ( (4 - r²)/4 )^2 → denominator is (4 - r²)^2 /16.

So the metric in standard form would be ( (16) / (4 - r²)^2 ) (dr² + r² dθ²) multiplied by a factor of a² (which is 4), so:

Standard hyperbolic metric: (a²)/(1 - r²/a²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²) = (4) * (16)/(4 - r²)^2 (dr² + ...) )?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me compute the standard hyperbolic metric when a=2.

Standard form: ds² = (a²)/(1 - r²/a²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²).

Plug a=2: denominator becomes (1 - r²/4)^2 → (4 - r²)^2 / 16.

So the denominator is [ (4 - r²)^2 / 16 ] → so 1/denominator is 16/(4 - r²)^2.

Then, the metric becomes ds² = (4) * [16/(4 - r^2)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²) = (64)/(4 - r^2)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²).

But our given metric is 32/(4 - r^2) (dr² + ...). So it's different. So our given metric isn't the standard hyperbolic metric. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is for a sphere. Let me compare to the metric of a sphere with radius a=2.

The standard metric for a sphere in polar coordinates (with r being the actual radius) is ds² = (a² (1 - r²/a²)^(-1)) (dr² + r² dθ²). Wait, no, that's not correct, because when r approaches a, the metric term would blow up, which doesn't make sense for a sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the sphere using a different radial coordinate. Another approach: using the area element.

Wait, since the given metric leads to an area element that diverges at r=2, that suggests that the surface is not a compact sphere but perhaps a hyperbolic surface with infinite area. Or maybe it's a sphere, but the way the metric is written, the area is actually infinite.

But that can't be right because a sphere should have a finite area. So I must have made a mistake in my setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the area is only up to r=2, so it's a sphere, but the calculation seems to suggest infinite area, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should evaluate the integral more carefully. Let me write the integral again.

A = 2π ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r^2)] dr.

Let me change variables again. Let u =4 - r^2 → du = -2 r dr → (-du/2 ) = r dr.

So the integral becomes 2π * 32 ∫ [ r/(4 - r^2) dr ] from 0 to 2 → 64π ∫ [ r/(4 - r^2) dr ] from 0 to 2.

Substituting u =4 - r^2.

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

The integral becomes 64π ∫ [ (1/u) * (-du/2) ) ] from u=4 to u=0.

So, 64π * (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0 → 64π * (1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4.

Wait, because flipping the limits from 4 to 0 to 0 to4 gives a negative, and we already have a negative from substitution.

So that would be 64π * (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4.

Which is 32π ( ln 4 - ln 0 ).

But ln 0 is negative infinity, so ln4 - (-infty) is positive infinity. So the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

So the area is infinite. So the correct answer would be option D: +infty.

But why would the pseudosphere have infinite area? Oh, because a pseudosphere is a model of hyperbolic geometry, which is non-compact and has infinite area. Wait, but in this case, the metric only allows r up to 2. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing models.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the hyperbolic plane is represented within a disk of radius a, where the metric becomes singular at the boundary. But the Poincaré disk model has infinite area, despite the coordinate radius being finite. So perhaps the given metric is similar to that, representing a hyperbolic plane within a disk of radius 2, leading to infinite area.

Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere (which is the hyperbolic plane) would be infinite. So the correct option is D) +infty.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To analyze the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we first convert to polar coordinates where \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \). Substituting this into the metric, it becomes:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \left(dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2\right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, and the area element in polar coordinates is given by \( \sqrt{g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta}} \, dr \, d\theta \). Here, \( g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \) and \( g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} \). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
\det g = g_{rr} g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2} = \frac{1024 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

Thus, the area element is:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Factoring out constants:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the integral, use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \) or \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). The limits change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1}{2u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln |u| \), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = 16 \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

As \( \ln 0 \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area \( A \) is infinite.

This result aligns with the fact that the metric describes a pseudosphere (a hyperboloid of one sheet), which is a non-compact surface of constant negative curvature. Non-compact hyperbolic surfaces have infinite area. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

**Critical analysis of the options:**

- **Option A (0):** Incorrect. The area is not zero; the surface is non-degenerate.
- **Option B (\( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)):** Incorrect. This expression depends on \( x \) and \( y \), which is inconsistent with the global property of area.
- **Option C (\( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)):** Incorrect. Similar to Option B, this expression depends on \( x \) and \( y \), which is not valid for a global area.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\)):** Correct. The calculation shows that the area diverges due to the infinite extent of the pseudosphere.

**Answer: D**
