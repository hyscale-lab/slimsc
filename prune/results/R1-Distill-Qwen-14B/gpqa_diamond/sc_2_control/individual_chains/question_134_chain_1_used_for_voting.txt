Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The problem states that we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change (ΔH) for such reactions is usually negative because it's exothermic.

Wait, but wait. All these are strong acid and strong base solutions? HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So they should all react completely.

First, I think I need to find out how much H+ and OH- ions are present in each solution. Because the neutralization reaction depends on the H+ and OH- ions combining.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from each acid solution.

For HCl: HCl dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters) = 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Each HCl gives one H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

For H2SO4: H2SO4 is a strong acid and in aqueous solution, it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. The moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

2. Now calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait a second. Neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. But the stoichiometry here matters. The acid and base will neutralize each other based on H+ and OH- availability.

So the total H+ is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent here because 0.2 < 0.28. That means all OH- will react, and there will be excess H+ left.

So the moles of water formed will be 0.2 moles. Because each H+ and OH- combine in a 1:1 ratio.

But wait, reactions may not be 1:1 because of the nature of the acids and bases.

Let me think again. For HCl, which is monoprotic, and sulfuric acid, which is diprotic, but in the case of H2SO4, since we're dealing with a base that's dihydroxide (Ba(OH)2), perhaps the reaction is as follows.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by writing the reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O

But wait, the way they're mixed all together, perhaps it's better to consider the total H+ and OH-.

So the overall reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ available: 0.28 from HCl and H2SO4.

Moles of OH-: 0.2 from Ba(OH)2.

So when they react, 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH- will form 0.2 moles of H2O.

The remaining H+ is 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But since that's excess, it doesn't contribute to the neutralization, I think.

But wait, neutralization is about the reaction between acid and base. So the enthalpy change would be based on the amount that actually neutralizes, which is 0.2 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, no. Because sometimes, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ or per mole of OH-.

I recall that the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is typically given as per mole of H+ or OH- involved. For strong acids and strong bases, it's about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-), since the standard value is around there.

Wait, but let me think: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is often taken as -57 kJ/mol, assuming 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH-.

So in this case, the moles reacting are 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- each. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the options. Looking at the options:

Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not exactly 11.4. Hmm, but some of the other options are in kcal.

Wait, the options are a mix of kcal and kJ, which is confusing. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Ah, so some are in kcal and some in kJ. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈ 4.184 kJ). Let me compute 11.4 / 4.184 ≈ 2.72. So 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So why is option D (-16 kJ) an option? Because wait, perhaps the calculation is for more than 0.2 moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me recheck the calculations.

Calculating moles of H+:
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So yes, the OH- is 0.2 mol. So moles reacting would be 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the total moles of H+ and OH- reacting is 0.2 each. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). But option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, no, because 57 kJ per mole is approximately 13.66 kcal (since 57 /4.184 ≈ 13.66). So 0.2 mol would be 2.73 kcal? Hmm, let me calculate:

57 kJ per mole → in kcal, that's 57 /4.184 ≈13.64 kcal per mole H+.

So 0.2 moles would give 0.2 *13.64 ≈2.73 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.73 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So in kcal, that's -11.4 /4.184 ≈-2.72 kcal. So the answer would be either A) or B) depending on units.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the total neutralized is 0.2 moles of H+ and OH-, so the enthalpy is -11.4 kJ or -2.72 kcal. Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, and option D is -16 kJ. So which is correct?

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering how the H2SO4 contributes. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it's in solution, does it donate both H+ ions? Yes, as it's a strong acid. So the calculation is correct.

Wait another possibility: perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, the neutralization is different. Let me think about the possible reactions.

Wait, the way I did it before, treating all H+ and OH- as reacting, is correct. Because regardless of the source, H+ from HCl or H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the calculation is correct, giving 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacting, so 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ converted into kcal? Wait no, because 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal. So option B is -11.42 kcal, which would imply that the calculation was done as 0.2 moles times 57.1 kJ per mole (maybe).

Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact value. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.0 kJ/mol. So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. So why is option D present?

Wait, maybe I should consider the total heat released when all the acids and base neutralize each other. But wait, in our calculation, only 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- reacted. The remaining 0.08 moles of H+ would not contribute to the neutralization, but perhaps the excess would affect the final temperature. But in terms of enthalpy of neutralization, which is per mole of reaction, it's just the 0.2 moles.

Hmm, but looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ. That's significantly different. 16 is about 3.82 *4.184≈16. So 3.82 kcal. Wait, but 0.2 *57 is 11.4, which is 2.72 kcal. So why option D is 16 kJ? That suggests 0.349 moles reacting, but where would that come from.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Let me double-check:

HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So yes, the OH- is 0.2 mol.

So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2, as OH- is the limiting reagent.

So 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So why is option D -16 kJ and option B -11.42 kcal.

Wait, maybe the question is asking about the total enthalpy, not per mole. So if the neutralization is 0.2 moles, then 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is option D's magnitude? Wait no, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than 11.4.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the reactions again. Maybe the neutralization isn't just H+ + OH- but involves the specific acids and bases, which could have different enthalpies.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the heat released using the formula q = m * c * ΔT. But wait, I don't have the masses or specific heat, so that approach isn't possible here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering all the H+ in the solutions, including those that don't react. But no, the neutralization only involves the H+ and OH- that actually react.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the fact that H2SO4 is diprotic, so perhaps it contributes two H+ per molecule, but Ba(OH)2 contributes two OH- per molecule. So the stoichiometry is 1:1 but for each H2SO4, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of HCl, one mole of H+ is released, and for each mole of H2SO4, two moles of H+ are released.

Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- per mole.

So in the reaction, each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two moles of H+.

So the neutralization between H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2) would require:

Moles of H+ = 0.28.

Moles of OH- = 0.2 * 2 = 0.4? Wait no, wait:

Wait, no, Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per mole, so 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2 give 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when H+ and OH- combine, it's 1:1. So 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So 0.2 OH- can neutralize 0.2 H+.

The remaining H+ is 0.08, which doesn't react.

So the moles of H+ that react is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, which isn't directly an option. Looking at the options again:

Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 57 kJ is about 13.66 kcal per mole). So 0.2 *13.66 ≈2.73 kcal. So the answer would be option A (-2.72 kcal) or option B (-11.42 kcal) if considering the value in kJ.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 3.82 kcal. That doesn't align with our calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Maybe the problem is considering the stoichiometry differently, like considering the complete neutralization of each acid with the base.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate how much of each acid reacts with the base.

Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per formula unit.

HCl provides 1 H+ per molecule.

H2SO4 provides 2 H+ per molecule.

Let's think of the neutralization as each H+ from any source reacting with OH-.

The total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So all OH- is used, neutralizing 0.2 H+.

So the total moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ, which is option B (-11.42 kcal) if you convert kJ to kcal. Wait, no, because -11.4 kJ is about -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the question is expecting the answer in kJ, then none of the options directly match except perhaps option D (-16 kJ), but that's way off.

Wait, let me reevaluate. Maybe the question is about the total heat released regardless of neutralization, but that's not likely since it's about enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy per mole of reaction is different. Maybe for each mole of H+ and OH- reacting, it's -57 kJ, but perhaps the problem uses a different value, like -45 kJ per mole or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula q = n * ΔH, where ΔH is per mole of H+.

Wait, but I think the standard value is about -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So, the calculation is correct, giving -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal.

Looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which aligns with this.

But wait, another thought: maybe the problem expects the answer in kJ without converting to kcal. So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options have that except option D is -16, which is way off.

Hmm, so the options are a bit confusing. Let me check the options again:

Option A: -2.72 kcal

Option B: -11.42 kcal

Option C: -3.80 kcal

Option D: -16.0 kJ

So if the correct calculation is -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal, then option A is correct. But option B is -11.42 kcal, which would imply the calculation is done in kJ but presented as kcal. But 11.42 kcal is about 48.5 kJ, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all the H+ and OH- and see if any other reactions are involved.

Wait, perhaps when Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4, the reaction produces BaSO4, which is a precipitate and might have a different enthalpy.

Wait, maybe the problem is more complex than I thought. Because when you mix a diprotic acid like H2SO4 with a base like Ba(OH)2, the reaction might produce two moles of water.

Let me write the reactions:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O?

Wait, no, HCl is monoprotic, so reaction would be 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Similarly, H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So for each mole of HCl, 1 mole of H+ is neutralized, but in the case of H2SO4, each mole contributes 2 H+.

But the problem is that all the solutions are mixed together, so the H+ from all sources will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ react, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted.

The enthalpy change would be based on 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

So, the calculation remains the same: 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is -2.72 kcal.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A (-2.72 kcal) or option D (-16 kJ) if considering something else. But according to the calculation, it's more likely to be option A.

Wait, but wait the options mix kcal and kJ. The question says 'calculate the enthalpy of neutralization', and the options have both units. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kcal, making option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in kilojoules, but none of the options match, except perhaps option D is -16 kJ, but that's not matching. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stoichiometry differently. Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid, and moles of OH- from the base.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O.

The OH- is 0.2 mol, so it will neutralize 0.2 mol of H+.

Which 0.2 comes from HCl and H2SO4.

But to find which acid contributes how much, perhaps it doesn't matter, as the enthalpy is per mole of H+.

So the total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

Which is approximately -2.72 kcal. So the answer is option A.

But why is option B present with -11.42 kcal? Oh, because 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal, but 11.42 kcal would be 48.58 kJ, which is way higher than our calculation. So option B is probably a distractor.

So the correct answer is A) -2.72 kcal.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl dissociates completely into H⁺ and Cl⁻.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since each HCl molecule contributes one H⁺, moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is a diprotic acid and dissociates completely into 2 H⁺ and SO₄²⁻.  
   Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Total moles of H⁺**:  
   \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} + 0.18 \, \text{mol} = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

4. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely into Ba²⁺ and 2 OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

5. **Reaction and limiting reagent**:  
   The neutralization reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   The limiting reagent is OH⁻, as there are only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ available to react with \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺.  
   Therefore, \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ and OH⁻ will react, forming \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H₂O.

6. **Enthalpy change**:  
   The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) for strong acids and strong bases.  
   For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of reaction:  
   \( \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   Converting to kcal: \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

7. **Analysis of options**:  
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**: Matches the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it does not align with the calculated value in either kJ or kcal.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal)**: Incorrect, as it is far from the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ)**: Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

The correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**. 

Answer: A
