Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The question gives me five stars and I need to figure out which pairs can be seen by both instruments.

First, I'll read the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, higher magnitudes mean dimmer stars. Because the magnitude scale is weird, where lower numbers are brighter. So, if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can see stars with V mag less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, meaning apparent V mag less than or equal to 16.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, stars with V <=17 can be observed. Because magnitude 17 is dimmer. So, if a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude is less than 17. Because the magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter.

So, for ESPRESSO, the star's apparent V mag must be less than or equal to 17. For HIRES, the star must be less than or equal to 16. So, a star must be <=16 in V mag to be observed by both, because 16 is the brighter limit between the two.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, then it can be observed by ESPRESSO. So that's V <17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V <16. So, to be detectable by both, a star must have V <16. Because the stricter condition is 16. So any star with apparent V mag less than 16 can be observed by both.

But wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So the apparent V magnitude must be less than or equal to 17. Similarly, for HIRES, the star's apparent V must be <=16.

So, a star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be observed by both.

Now, looking at the stars:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude V = absolute mag (M) + distance modulus (5 log10(d) -5). So d=10, distance modulus is 5(1) -5 = 0. So V =15.5 +0 =15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. So <=16? Yes. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. So it can be observed by both. Because 15.5 <17 and <16. Wait, no: 15.5 is less than 16, right? Because 15.5 is 0.5 less than 16. So Star1 can be seen by both.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it again. Absolute magnitude M is 15.5. Distance is 10 pc. The formula is apparent V magnitude m = M + 5 log (d/10). So d=10, so d/10 is 1. log(1) is 0. So m =15.5 +0=15.5. So yes.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5, which is greater than 16. So HIRES can't see it. So Star2 can't be detected by HIRES. So only ESPRESSO can see it, but not HIRES. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction (E(B-V)=0.6 mag). So I need to correct for extinction to get the true apparent V. Because extinction makes stars appear dimmer (apparent magnitude increases). Wait, wait. Wait, the star's apparent magnitude is given as 15.5, but extinction would make it appear fainter. So the observed apparent V is 15.5, but without extinction, it would be brighter. Or wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: E(B-V) is the color excess, which is E(B) - E(V). The reddening E(B-V) is positive. The absorption in V band is A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude is the intrinsic magnitude plus absorption. Wait, no. The observed V magnitude (what we measure) is m = M + distance modulus + extinction.

Wait, no. Wait, the apparent magnitude m is the sum of the absolute magnitude (M), the distance modulus, and the extinction (A_v). So yes: m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_v. Hmm, but wait, in the Star3 description, it says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag". So does that mean that the 15.5 is the observed m, or the intrinsic?

Wait, the question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So, the given apparent V is 15.5, but that's after extinction. So to find the true apparent V (without extinction), would that be m0 = m + A_v? Because extinction makes the star appear fainter (higher magnitude). So if m is 15.5, then without extinction, it would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the given m is the observed apparent magnitude, which includes extinction.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So if the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_true, then when there's extinction, the observed m increases by A_v.

Wait, no, wait. The formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10) + A_v. So for Star3, M is 15.5? Wait, no, Star3's given absolute V magnitude is not given. Wait, no, Star3 is given as apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6, located at 15 pc.

So the problem is a bit more involved. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude is measured as m, which includes the extinction. So m = m_true + A_v, where m_true is the apparent magnitude without extinction.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" but with extinction E(B-V)=0.6. So I think the 15.5 is the observed m, which includes the extinction. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_true = m - A_v.

Wait, no. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer. So if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude m_true, and there's extinction, the observed m would be m_true + A_v.

So in Star3's case, observed m is 15.5. So the intrinsic m_true is 15.5 - A_v. A_v is 3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.6=1.86. So m_true =15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

But wait, that's the apparent magnitude without extinction. But for the purpose of the question, does the spectrograph's visibility depend on the observed apparent magnitude (including extinction) or the intrinsic apparent magnitude?

Ah, because the spectrograph's detection depends on the apparent brightness as observed through the atmosphere. So extinction (due to dust) affects the observed apparent magnitude. So if the star's observed apparent magnitude is m, and it's subject to extinction, then the m_observed is m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, but in the problem, Star3's apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5, which is the observed value, including extinction. So A_v =1.86. So the intrinsic m (if no extinction) would be 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that's not relevant because the detection is based on the observed m.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question is, for each star, can we detect it with both spectrographs. The detection depends on the apparent V magnitude as observed, because that's what the instrument sees. So for Star3, its apparent V is 15.5 mag, but when considering extinction, it might actually be brighter. Wait, no. No, extinction makes it appear dimmer. So the apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) because of extinction. So without extinction, the star would have a lower apparent magnitude (brighter).

Wait, but the question gives the apparent magnitude as 15.5, which already includes extinction. So in order to see if the star is bright enough for the spectrographs, we have to use the apparent magnitude as observed, which is 15.5.

Wait, but then why is the extinction given? Oh, because maybe the apparent magnitude is after extinction. So the spectrograph sees the star at 15.5, which is dimmer than the actual star. So to find if the star is detectable, we use m_observed.

So Star3: m=15.5. So is 15.5 <=17 (ESPRESSO) and <=16 (HIRES)? Well, 15.5 is less than both 17 and 16. So yes. So Star3 can be seen by both.

Wait, no, 15.5 is less than 16, so it's okay for HIRES. So yes, Star3 can be detected by both.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain. Because sometimes, the extinction might affect the actual brightness in a way that the star is dimmer than it appears, but that's already accounted for in the observed m.

So moving on.

Star4: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So distance modulus is 5 log(10/10) =0. So m = M +0=15.5. Oh, but E(B-V)=0.4, so A_v=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude is m=15.5 +1.24=16.74. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so m increases by A_v.

Wait, wait, earlier confusion arises. Let me think again. If the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude is 15.5, then the observed apparent magnitude would be 15.5 + 1.24 =16.74.

So Star4's observed m is 16.74.

So is this <=17 and <=16?

Wait, 16.74 is greater than 16. So for HIRES, which can only see up to 16, this star's m is 16.74, which is above 16. So HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can see up to 17. So 16.74 is less than 17. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES. So it can't be in the pair.

Wait, but wait. Did I compute the m correctly? Because Star4 is given as absolute magnitude M=15.5, located at 10 pc. So the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude is m = M +5 log (d/10) =15.5 +0=15.5. Then, with extinction, m_observed =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Yes. So Star4's observed m is 16.74. So HIRES can't detect it, since 16.74>16. So Star4 can't be seen by both.

Star5: Absolute V magnitude is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So distance modulus is 5 log(5/10) =5 log(0.5)=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505. So m = M + distance modulus + A_v?

Wait, no. Wait, no extinction is given for Star5. So Star5's apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log(d/10). M is 16.5, d=5.

So 5 log(5/10)=5*(log(0.5))=5*(-0.3010)= -1.505.

So m =16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995, approximately 15.0. So apparent V is 15.0.

So Star5's m is 15.0, which is less than 16 and 17. So both spectrographs can detect it.

So now, let's list which stars can be detected by both:

Star1: m=15.5; both can detect.
Star3: m=15.5; both can detect.
Star5: m=15.0; both can detect.

Wait, wait, wait. Earlier, Star1's m is 15.5 (no extinction?), but wait, Star1's description doesn't mention extinction. Let me check the stars again.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude of 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m =15.5 +0=15.5. No extinction given, so no A_v. So m=15.5. So both can detect.

Star2: m=16.5. HIRES can't (needs <=16), ESPRESSO can (<=17). So only ESPRESSO can see Star2.

Star3: m=15.5 after extinction. So both can see.

Star4: m=16.74, so only ESPRESSO can see.

Star5: m=15.0, both can see.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5. Now, looking at the options:

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 is 16.74, which is too dim for HIRES. So only Star5 would work. So no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both can be detected by both. So this is possible.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 is m=16.5, which is too dim for HIRES. So no.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star1 can be detected by both, Star4 only by ESPRESSO. So no.

So the correct pair is Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but wait. Let me check Star5 again. Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m =16.5 + 5 log(5/10) = 16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995, which is approx 15.0. So that's correct.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1 (m=15.5), Star3 (m=15.5), and Star5 (m=15.0). So looking at the options, option B is 'Star3 and Star5'. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4's m is 16.74, which is above 16, so HIRES can't. So no.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both have m <=16, so yes.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m=16.5, which is above HIRES limit.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 is 16.74, which is above HIRES.

So the correct answer is option B: Star3 and Star5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 \).  
   - No extinction is mentioned.  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \cdot E(B-V) = 3.1 \cdot 0.6 = 1.86 \).  
   - The observed apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction, so \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star3 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Intrinsic apparent magnitude \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 0 = 15.5 \).  
   - Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), so \( A_V = 3.1 \cdot 0.4 = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude \( m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Distance modulus: \( 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = -1.505 \).  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = M + \text{distance modulus} = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).  
   - No extinction is mentioned.  
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3** and **Star5**. 

**Answer: B**
