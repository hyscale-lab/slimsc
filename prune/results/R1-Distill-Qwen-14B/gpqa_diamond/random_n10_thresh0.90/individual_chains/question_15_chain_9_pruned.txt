Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one that has the highest probability of transiting. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Hmm, both planets have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, 300 days, Planet_1's would be 100 days. That means Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star, right?

The stars are important too. The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would their masses be different but radii the same? Oh, maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but hasn't expanded yet, while Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but hasn't expanded much yet. Or perhaps the radius is the same because they're similar types of stars but one is more evolved. Not sure, but probably not super important for the transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on relative to us. But wait, isn't the transit probability also related to the orbital distance and the star's size?

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (something with the orbital inclination). Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_star / a) * sin(i), but wait, no, actually, the geometric probability is (R* / a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass in front of the star from our viewpoint. So the probability is higher when a is smaller and R* is larger. Because (R*/a) would be bigger.

Wait, but in this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R* is same for both. So the probability depends inversely on a. So the closer the planet is to its star (smaller a), the higher the chance of transit.

Wait, but a is related to the orbital period. For planets with the same mass and stars, the semi-major axis can be found using Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(M_star) = (G*M_planet and M_star in a certain way). Wait, the exact formula is a^3 = (G(M_star + M_planet) * P^2)/(4π²), but since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So a is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3).

So, a = [ (G * M_star * P² )/(4π²) ) ]^(1/3)

But since P is the orbital period, and M_star is the mass of the star, so a relates to both.

Given that Planet_1's period is P1 = P2 /3. Because Planet_1's period is three times shorter. So P1 = (1/3) * P2.

And M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 * M2.
