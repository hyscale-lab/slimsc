Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let me try to think through it. Hmm. The problem says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Wait, parallax... right, parallax is related to distance. I remember that the parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. Oh right, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, parallax decreases.

But the question is about the number of stars as a function of parallax. They say the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, which can also be written as N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant.

But we want to find how the number of stars changes with distance. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in. Let's see, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Wait, because plx is 1/d, so 1/plx^5 would be (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The number varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5. That suggests that as distance d increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because I thought that as you go further away, there are fewer stars in a given volume. Oh, wait, but this is a specific region of the sky, so maybe it's about how the number varies with distance.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance r. Oh, right. So the change in number with distance, as in the differential number per distance. Hmm. So perhaps we need to express N as a function of d, and then find dN/dr.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5 d^4. Which would mean that the number of stars increases with r^4 per unit distance. Wait, but wait, the options are about how N changes with r. Let me make this more precise.

Let me formalize it. Let me write N as a function of plx. N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So N = k d^5, where k is a constant.

Wait, but wait, that would mean that as d increases, N increases. But that doesn't make sense with typical stellar distribution. But maybe in this specific region, it's the case. Hmm. But putting that aside for a moment, the problem is about how N changes with distance. So, perhaps they're asking for the rate of change of N with respect to r, the distance.

So, if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd = 5 d^4. But wait, the question is phrased as 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. So perhaps it's the differential, the change in number per unit distance.

So if N = k d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr = 5 k d^4.

Wait, but the options are about the dependence on r. So if d is the distance, and r is the unit range, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4, because d^4 would be r^4 if r is the distance.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d is the distance in parsecs. So N ∝ d^5. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4 (since r is d in this context). So the number of stars per unit range of distance is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but why would the number of stars increase with distance? That's not typical. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go through it again.

The number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, N increases even more. That seems odd, but perhaps the question is just about the mathematical relationship regardless of physical intuition.

So the change in number with distance would be dN/dr. So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to d^4, which is r^4.

So the correct answer is C) ~ r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)) in parsecs (\( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \)), substituting this into the relationship gives \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with distance as \( d^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we calculate the differential \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), taking the derivative with respect to \( d \) (or \( r \)) gives \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases with \( r^4 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ \( r^3 \)**  
**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**  
**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**  
**D) ~ \( r^2 \)**  

The correct choice is **C**, as the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Answer: C
