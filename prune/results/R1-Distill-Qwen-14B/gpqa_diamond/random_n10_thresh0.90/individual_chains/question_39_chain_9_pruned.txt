Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function. Let me read the question carefully.

The setup is that there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle that's under the same conditions. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, and when they measure the position, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region, I guess?

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but the modulus squared gives the probability density. Oh right, because the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Wait, but how does that work with the given wave function?

Wait, let me think again. The wave function is given as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So if I take the absolute square, the probability density would be |ψ(x)|². For the particle to exist only between 1 and 3, the wave function must be zero outside that interval, right? Because when you square the modulus, the probability should be zero where the particle isn't found.

But wait, looking at the given ψ(x), it's a complex function. The real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. Hmm, but for the wave function to be zero outside 1<x<3, this expression must equal zero for x <1 and x>3. But wait, that's not possible because the real part a/sqrt(1+x) can't be zero unless a is zero, but that would make the entire wave function zero, which can't be right because then the probability would be zero everywhere.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Oh, wait, the problem says that the wave function described is in the part of space where the particle can exist. So perhaps the wave function is only defined between x=1 and x=3, and outside, it's zero. So the given function applies in that interval, and is zero elsewhere.

So the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i within x=1 to x=3, and zero elsewhere. So the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, which fits with the measurement results.

But then, to find 'a', we can use the normalization condition. The integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is a complex number, the modulus squared is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2.

The real part is a/sqrt(1+x), the imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me break
