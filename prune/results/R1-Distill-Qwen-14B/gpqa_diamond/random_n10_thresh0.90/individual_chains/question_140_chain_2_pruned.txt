Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again and break it down.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, form a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, a keto acid reacting with X gives a product with two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, similar to one of its analogs.

Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, especially violent ones, metals reacting with acids often produce hydrogen gas. But wait, gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about gases released in reactions. Hydrogen is H2, which has 1 proton each. Wait, but H2 would have 0 neutrons each because hydrogen has atomic number 1. So, same number of protons and neutrons would mean each atom has equal p and n. For hydrogen, that's not possible except maybe if it's deuterium, but the molecule itself? Wait, maybe the molecule is something else.

Wait, let's think of possible gases. What about water vapor? No, because H2O has 8 protons (O is 8, H is 1 each). No, wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons per molecule? Or per atom? Oh, wait, the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, total protons equals total neutrons across all atoms.

Wait, but that's a bit tricky. Let me think of possible molecules. Let me see, for example, ammonia (NH3) has 14 (N) and 3 H (1 each). So total protons: 14 +3=17. Neutrons: N has 14 neutrons (14-7=7?), wait no, N has atomic number 7, so protons=7, and the isotope would determine neutrons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the gas is CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if it's C-12). CO2 has one C and two O. So total protons: 6 (C) + 16 * 2 (O) = 6 + 32 =38. Neutrons: 6 (C) (if C is 12) and 8 each for O (because O has 8 protons, so if it's O-16, neutrons are 8 each). So total neutrons: 6 (C) + 8*2 = 6 +16=22. 38 protons vs 22 neutrons: not equal.

Hmm, maybe the gas is something like CH4. Protons: 6 (C) +4 (H) =10. Neutrons: C is 6 (if 12C) and H is 0 each. So total neutrons 6. 10 vs 6: nope.

Wait, maybe the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in total. Let's think of H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. What about O2? Each O has 8 protons and typically 8 neutrons (O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). So 16 each. That fits! So gas W is O2? But wait, in reactions, when metals react with acids, the gas is usually H2. Hmm, but maybe if it's a different reaction.

Wait, back to the problem. Substance X reacts with Y (liquid) violently, releasing W. If W is O2, that would suggest a decomposition reaction, maybe. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, another possibility: H2O? No, because H2O is a liquid, not a gas. Unless it's steam, but then the molecule would have 2 H (each 1 proton) and O (8). So total protons 10, neutrons (each O is 8 neutrons) so 8. 10 vs 8: nope.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3. Let's see, N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So NH3 has 7 +3 =10 protons. Neutrons: N has 7- if it's N-14, 7 neutrons, and H has 0. So 7. 10 vs 7: nope.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think about other possibilities. What about NO? Nitrogen and oxygen. NO has 7 +8 =15 protons. Neutrons: N-14 (7 neutrons) and O-16 (8). So 7 +8 =15. Protons =15, neutrons=15. So that works! So gas W is NO.

Wait, but NO is a gas, but I'm not sure if it's a common reaction product. Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule.

Wait, but let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, whose melting point is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm, water freezes at 0°C, so 4°C is just above that. What substance has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe something like water, but water's melting point is 0. Alternatively, perhaps sodium nitrate or another salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if G is a precipitate that when heated releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K (which is 4°C). That suggests that B could be a solid, maybe something like ice? Because ice melts at 0°C, which is near 277 K. But then why would G, when heated, release B? Maybe G is a hydrate that when heated loses water (B would be water), but that would produce steam, not ice. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium nitrate, which has a high melting point, but that might not fit. Wait, maybe B is something else. Let me think of other substances. Another thought: ammonium nitrate has a melting point around 169°C, which is higher than 277 K (which is 4°C). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So if B has a melting point near that, perhaps it's a substance that's solid around that temperature. Alternatively, could B be something like dry ice (CO2 solid), but CO2's melting point is higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is sodium carbonate. Wait, Na2CO3 has a melting point of about 854°C, so that's way higher.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let's think of the reaction. Substance X reacts with Y, a liquid, which could be an acid. If X is a metal, reacting with an acid (like HCl or H2SO4), it would produce a salt, hydrogen gas, and perhaps some precipitate.

But the gas W has same protons as neutrons. If W is H2, that's 2 protons and 0 neutrons: doesn't fit. So maybe another gas.

Wait, perhaps W is something like O2. Then the molecule would have 16 protons (each O has 8, so O2 has 16) and 16 neutrons (each O is 16, so 8 each *2 is 16). So yes, 16 each. So W is O2. Then, the reaction would be something that produces O2. For example, decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, but X is the catalyst. Or maybe a metal reacting with an acid but producing O2? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is another diatomic gas. Let's think, like Cl2. Cl has 17 protons, so Cl2 would have 34. Neutrons: Cl-35 has 18 neutrons each, so 36 total. 34 vs 36: not equal. So no.

Wait, maybe W is a noble gas? Like Xe? Xe has atomic number 54, so each atom has 54 protons. Neutrons: Xe-131 has 77 neutrons. So 54 vs 77: nope.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the other parts of the question. The product of a keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Keto acids are like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. When it reacts with something, perhaps a base, it forms a salt. For example, acetic acid plus NaOH gives sodium acetate, water, and CO2. But the product in this case has two O atoms.

Wait, but the product of the reaction is a compound. Let me think of possible reactions. Maybe X is a base, and the keto acid neutralizes it to form a salt. For example, if X is NaOH, then reacting with acetic acid would give sodium acetate, water, and CO2. But the product, sodium acetate, has O atoms. Let me count: sodium acetate is CH3COONa. It has two O in the acetate ion (each O in COO-). So that's two O atoms in the product. So X could be NaOH? But then, what about the other parts of the question.

Wait, the melting point of B is 277 K, which is about 4°C. Sodium acetate's melting point is around 324°C, so that's higher. Hmm.

Wait, let's think of another scenario. If X is a metal, like sodium. Sodium reacts with an acid (like H2O, but that's a liquid Y). Reaction: 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So the gas W would be H2. But H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (if H is 1H), so 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

But wait, if the acid is H2SO4, the reaction would produce SO2 or H2? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the acid is H3PO4, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Maybe G is a carbonate. For example, sodium carbonate is a precipitate when NaOH reacts with an acid. Heating sodium carbonate doesn't release anything, but if it's a bicarbonate, heating might release CO2. Hmm, but B's melting point is about 4°C, which is just above 0. Alternatively, maybe B is water (melting point 0°C, but close to 277 K), but why would G release water when heated? Or perhaps B is something like ice, but that's not a common product.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. For example, if X is a metal and Y is water, perhaps the reaction forms a metal hydroxide, which upon heating decomposes into something. For instance, sodium hydroxide when heated doesn't decompose, but perhaps another hydroxide does. Alternatively, if G is a carbonate, heating might release CO2 and leave behind a metal oxide.

Wait, but the melting point of B is around 4°C. That's close to the melting point of water, but maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Considering the product of a keto acid and X has two O atoms. If X is NaOH, then the product (like sodium acetate) has two O in the acetate ion. So that fits. So maybe X is NaOH. Then, when X reacts with Y, which is perhaps water, but the reaction would be different. Alternatively, Y could be an acid.

Wait, but if X is NaOH and Y is an acid like H2SO4, then the reaction would produce Na2SO4, water, and maybe gas. But the reaction would be:

2 NaOH + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + 2 H2O.

No gas produced here. So that doesn't fit with the gas W being released.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck. Let's try another angle. The product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms, like CO2? No, that's three atoms. Wait, another thought: if X is a base that neutralizes the keto acid, the product is a salt. For example, if the acid is H2CO3 (carbonic acid), and X is NaOH, then the product is Na2CO3, which has three O in the carbonate ion. But that's three O, not two. Hmm. Or maybe the product is something like CH3COO-Na+ (sodium acetate), which has two O in the acetate ion.

Wait, but the question says the product has two atoms of oxygen. Wait, maybe it's a molecule with two O atoms in total, not per formula unit. Like, for example, a molecule like H2O2 has two O, but that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like a ketone. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So, the product is a molecule with two O atoms. So, for example, if the keto acid is reacting with X (maybe a base) to form a salt and water. Or perhaps a different kind of reaction.

Wait, maybe the keto acid is reacting with a metal to form a carboxylate salt. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with sodium (Na) would produce CH3COO^- Na^+ and H2 gas. So the product would be the salt, which has O in the acetate ion. How many O? CH3COO^- has two O: one from COO. So the product (salt) has two O atoms in the acetate part. So this fits.

So in this scenario, X would be Na metal. Then, the reaction of Na with an acid (like H2O?) would produce H2 gas. But earlier, we thought W's molecule needs to have same protons and neutrons. H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, but wait, maybe the acid is not H2O but another acid. For example, if Y is H2SO4, then Na reacts with H2SO4 to produce Na2SO4, H2 gas, and heat. So gas W is H2, which doesn't fit the earlier condition. So maybe X isn't Na.

Another thought: Maybe X is a heavy isotope-containing substance. The question says X incorporates a heavier isotope. For example, if one of its elements is Cl-35 or Cl-37 instead of Cl-35, but wait, Cl is usually 35 and 37. So perhaps X is Cl-based, but that's a stretch.

Wait, the question says that the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So, looking for elements in X with the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their atomic masses.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound. Let's think of common reagents in organic chemistry. One such reagent is sodium methoxide, or maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe X is a Grignard reagent, but I don't think Grignards have heavy isotopes.

Wait, other reagents: Maybe X is H2O, but that's not a reagent that would react violently with another liquid, unless it's something like H2O with a strong acid or base. Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy water isotope, like D2O, but that's not a common reagent.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal, like potassium or sodium, which react violently with water. But earlier issues about the gas W.

Wait, let me think of the reaction again. X reacts with Y (liquid), releasing gas W. Suppose Y is H2O. Then X could be a metal, like Na or K. The reaction would be 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So gas W is H2, which has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That's not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate reacting with an acid. Wait, but that would release CO2 gas. CO2 has 22 protons (12 from C, 16*2 from O). Wait, no, CO2 is C:6, O:8 each. So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: C (6) has 6 in C-12, each O has 8 (O-16). So total neutrons: 6 + 8*2=22. Oh! So protons and neutrons are both 22. So that fits. So W would be CO2. Then, the reaction would be a carbonate reacting with an acid to produce CO2 gas.

But then, X would be a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. So X is Na2CO3. Then, Y could be H2SO4. The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

Then, precipitate G? Wait, this reaction produces Na2SO4 (which is soluble), so no precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y is another acid. Or perhaps X is a metal carbonate and Y is an acid that doesn't produce a soluble product. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid that produces a precipitate.

Wait, if Y is HCl, and X is Ag2CO3 (silver carbonate), which is not very stable. Alternatively, maybe X is CaCO3, which reacts with HCl to produce CO2, CaCl2 (soluble), and water. So no precipitate. Hmm, but the question says a precipitate G forms. So maybe Y is not an acid but a solution that produces a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal hydroxide. For example, if Y is NaOH and X is Al. Al reacts with NaOH to produce H2 gas, but would that fit? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's step back.

Gas W must have the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. We earlier thought that CO2 fits because it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is CO2.

So the reaction releases CO2 gas. That suggests a reaction where carbonate reacts with an acid.

So X could be a carbonate. Let's say X is Na2CO3. When it reacts with an acid (like H2SO4), it produces CO2, water, and Na2SO4. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit with the precipitate G.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a different salt. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is a solution of CaCl2. The reaction would be:

Na2CO3 + CaCl2 → CaCO3↓ + 2 NaCl.

So precipitate G is CaCO3. When heated, CaCO3 decomposes into CaO and CO2. So B would be CO2? But earlier, B is the product when G is heated. Wait, no, G is CaCO3; when heated, it produces CO2 and CaO. But B is the product, which would be solid CaO. Wait, but CaO's melting point is around 2444°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, but B has a melting point of 277 K. Let me think of other possibilities. Maybe B is something like ice, but that would require G to release water when heated. Alternatively, maybe G is a basic carbonate that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction of a keto acid with X contains two O atoms. If X is NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) gives sodium acetate. Sodium acetate has two O in the acetate ion (CH3COO^-). So that fits. So X could be NaOH.

If X is NaOH, then Y is something that reacts with it to form a precipitate. Let's think: NaOH reacts with what to form a precipitate. Maybe Y is a salt solution that forms an insoluble hydroxide. For example, Y could be a solution of CuSO4. Then, NaOH reacts with CuSO4 to form Cu(OH)2↓ (precipitate G), Na2SO4, and H2O.

So G is Cu(OH)2. When heated, Cu(OH)2 decomposes into CuO and H2O. So B would be H2O (if the heating releases it, but then B would be the solid residue, which is CuO). But CuO's melting point is around 2200°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, another thought: what if Y is a solution of FeCl3. NaOH reacts with FeCl3 to form Fe(OH)3 precipitate. Heating Fe(OH)3 would decompose into Fe2O3 and H2O. The residue would be Fe2O3, which has a melting point much higher than 277 K.

Wait, perhaps B is not the solid residue but something else. Let me think, if G is the precipitate and upon heating, it releases B. So B is a gas or perhaps a liquid. Wait, but the problem says 'releases B', which could be a gas. But earlier, W is the gas in the initial reaction. So perhaps when G is heated, it releases B as a gas. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it might release CO2.

Wait, but earlier I thought B is the solid residue. Hmm. Maybe I'm still stuck.

Let me think about the melting point again. 277 K is 4°C. What solid has a melting point around that? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, its melting point is higher. Wait, maybe B is something like camphor, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate that releases water upon heating. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) would lose water when heated, but the melting point is higher.

Wait, another angle: If X is a heavy isotope-containing substance, which is used in organic chemistry. So perhaps X is D2O (heavy water), but that's a stretch. Or maybe X is something like CCl4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if X is NaOH, which is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, then the product with a keto acid is sodium acetate, which has two O atoms. That fits. Then, when NaOH reacts with Y (maybe HCl), but that would produce NaCl and H2O, no precipitate. Alternatively, Y is another liquid, like an alcohol. Wait, but how would that produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, and the reaction produces a salt. For example, if X is NaOH and Y is H2SO4, the reaction produces Na2SO4 and H2O. No precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a metal carbonate. Then NaOH would react with it to produce a precipitate. For example, Y could be a solution of CaCO3. NaOH and
