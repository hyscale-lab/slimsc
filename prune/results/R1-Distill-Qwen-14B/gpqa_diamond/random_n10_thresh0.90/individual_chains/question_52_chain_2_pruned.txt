Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that there's a star with certain parameters: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. But when its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. They ask by what factor the ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. They also mention that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. And it's assumed that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Hmm. So I think this is related to the Boltzmann equation, which deals with the population of different energy levels in atoms. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is something like:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n is the number of atoms in each level,
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy),
- E is the energy,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

The ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on the temperature. But wait, in this problem, the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the overall effective temperature of the photosphere is lower. 

Wait, but wait. The star has spots. The spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, but how does that affect the overall photosphere's temperature? Oh, wait, the problem states that the overall Teff decreases when spots are present. So the effective temperature is 5500 K with spots. But I'm a bit confused about whether the photospheric temperature is uniform or varying. Since the problem says the photosphere is in LTE, each region is in local thermodynamic equilibrium, but the overall Teff is the average.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels. The transition corresponds to a specific wavelength. So the number of atoms in each level depends on the temperature where those atoms are. But if the star has spots, part of the photosphere is cooler, so the Ti atoms in those regions have lower temperatures, which would affect their energy level populations.

Wait, but how does that average out in the spectrum? Because when you have spots, the photosphere is a mix of hot and cool regions. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature has decreased. Hmm. Or perhaps, the star's overall Teff is an average, but the individual regions (spots and non-spots) have their own temperatures. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere is at 5500 K, but wait, that can't be right because the spots are cooler regions. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

Wait, the first part says that when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered, the Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star's total light output is lower when spots are present, hence the lower effective temperature. But each part of the surface (spots and non-spots) has its own temperature. But the problem says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti atoms, the ratio decreases when spots are present. So perhaps the observed ratio is an average of the different regions. Or maybe the photosphere as a whole is considered to have a certain temperature. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So maybe the photosphere's temperature is 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not. But that can't be right because the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. Wait, or is the Teff an average of the entire surface? Because spots are dark, they absorb light and emit less, so the overall effective temperature would be lower. So perhaps the average temperature of the entire surface is 5500 K when 40% is spots. But that seems a bit conflicting because the starspots are cooler regions, so the non-spotted regions must be hotter to bring the average down. Wait, no, because if 40% of the surface is cooler (spots), the average would be lower than 6000 K. So perhaps the Teff is lower because the spots are present.

Wait, but when the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K, which is higher. So when the surface is 40% covered by spots, the Teff is lower. So maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, like 5000 K or something, but the surrounding is hotter. But the problem doesn't give us the temperature of the spots themselves, only the overall Teff.

Hmm. But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, perhaps the ratio is determined by the temperature of the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower, which would affect the ratio.

Wait, but is the photosphere's temperature uniform? Or is it a mix of hotter and cooler regions? Because if the spots are cooler, the photosphere in those areas is at a lower temperature. So when you have spots, the overall photosphere is a mix of regions at different temperatures. But in the problem, it's stated that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region is locally in equilibrium. But when you observe the ratio of Ti atoms, you're integrating over all the regions, so the observed ratio will be a weighted average of the ratios from each region.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the overall Teff is lower, the average ratio is lower. But wait, how? Let me think about the Boltzmann factor. The ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 decreases.

So, in the case without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, the effective T is 5500 K. So the ratio would decrease when T decreases. Because lower T makes the exponential smaller, so n2/n1 is smaller.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is 5500 K, the ratio is lower than when T was 6000 K. So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

So we can compute the ratio of the two ratios. Let me denote R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -h c / (lambda k T) )

Wait, because E2 - E1 = h c / lambda, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and lambda is the wavelength.

But wait, the energy difference ΔE is given by (E2 - E1) = h c / lambda.

So, the ratio R is proportional to exp( - (h c) / (lambda k T) )

So, R = (g2/g1) * exp( - h c/(lambda k T) )

But since we're only looking for the factor by which the ratio changes, we can ignore the statistical weights (g factors) if they are the same for both cases. Because the ratio of R in two cases would be [exp(... for T1)] / [exp(... for T2)].

Wait, but wait. Let's assume that g2 and g1 are the same for both stars (same element, same levels), so their ratio is 1. So the ratio R is proportional to exp(- (h c) / (lambda k T) )

So, the ratio R = exp( - (h c)/(lambda k T) )

So, R1 is when T is 6000 K, and R2 is when T is 5500 K.

We need to find the factor F = R1 / R2.

Which is [exp( - (h c)/(lambda k T1) ) ] / [ exp( - (h c)/(lambda k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (h c) (1/(k T2) - 1/(k T1)) )

So F = exp( (h c / k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

But wait, let me calculate that. So,

F = exp( (h c)/(k) [1/T2 - 1/T1] )

Wait, no. Because the exponents are negative, so when you take R1/R2, the exponents subtract.

Wait, let me recast it:

R1 = exp( -x1 ), R2 = exp( -x2 ), so R1/R2 = exp( x2 - x1 )

Because R1/R2 = [exp(-x1)] / [exp(-x2)] = exp( x2 - x1 )

Which is exp( (x2 - x1) )

But x1 = h c/(lambda k T1 ), x2 = h c/(lambda k T2 )

So,

x2 -x1 = (h c)/(lambda k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So F = exp( (h c)/(lambda k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, but let me plug in the numbers.

We can compute this factor. Let me compute the exponent first.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38e-23 J/K

T1 = 6000 K

T2 = 5500 K

So,

(h c)/(lambda k) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = (1.448 * 1.38) e-30 m·J/(K·m) ? Wait, wait, units.

Wait, lambda is in meters, k in J/K. So denominator is (1.448e-7 m) * (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = approx 2e-30 J·m/(K·m) )? Wait, no, because it's 1.448e-7 m multiplied by 1.38e-23 J/K, so units are m·J/(K) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the numerical value.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25

Denominator: 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = 1.448 *1.38 = about 1.989; 1e-7 *1e-23=1e-30. So denominator ≈ 1.989e-30.

So (h c)/(lambda k) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.989e-30) ) ≈ (1.9878 / 1.989) * 1e5 ≈ approx 1e5, because 1.9878/1.989 is almost 1.

So approximately 1e5.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

1.9878e-25 / 1.989e-30 = (1.9878 / 1.989) * 1e5 ≈ (0.999) * 1e5 ≈ 99900 ≈ 1e5.

So (h c)/(lambda k) ≈ 1e5 K? Because units: (J s * m/s) / (m * J/K) ) → (J m) / (m J/K) ) → K.

Wait, yes, because:

h has units J s.

c is m/s.

lambda is m.

k is J/K.

So, (h c) has units (J s)(m/s) ) = J m.

Denominator: lambda k → (m)(J/K) )

So, (h c)/(lambda k) → (J m) / (m J/K) ) → K.

So, it's in Kelvin.

So, (h c)/(lambda k) ≈ 1e5 K.

So the exponent is:

(1e5 K) * [1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ]

We can compute [1/5500 - 1/6000] = (6000 - 5500) / (5500*6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) ) = (5e2) / (3.3e7) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So,

(1e5) * (1.515e-5) = approx 1.515.

So the exponent is about 1.515.

So F = exp(1.515) ≈ e^1.515.

Compute e^1.5 is about 4.48. e^1.515 is a bit higher. Let me compute 1.515:

e^1.5 is about 4.4817.

e^0.015 is about 1.0151.

So, 4.4817 * 1.0151 ≈ 4.4817 + (4.4817 * 0.0151) ≈ 4.4817 + 0.0677 ≈ 4.549.

So F ≈ 4.55.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

So option C is ~4.5, which matches our calculation.

But wait, I think I may have made a mistake in the sign. Let me double-check.

The exponent in F is (h c/(lambda k)) [1/T2 - 1/T1]

Which is positive because 1/T2 (5500) is greater than 1/T1 (6000). So 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.0001667, difference is 0.0000151.

So [1/T2 -1/T1] is positive.

So the exponent is positive, so F is e^(positive), which is greater than 1. So the ratio R1/R2 is e^(1.515) ≈ 4.55, which is about 4.5.

So the factor is ~4.5, so the answer is option C.

But wait, the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. R is n2/n1. So when the star has spots, R becomes smaller. So R1 is when no spots (T=6000, higher R), R2 when spots (T=5500, lower R). So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C. So the answer should be C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the transition, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The ratio of the number of atoms in the two energy levels depends exponentially on the temperature.

When the star has no spots, the effective temperature \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \). When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases to \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The ratio of the number of atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the temperature decreases because the exponential factor becomes smaller at lower temperatures.

The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
F = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{no spots}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spots}}} = \exp\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{hc}{\lambda k} \)
Using the constants:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \),
- \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{hc}{\lambda k} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{(1.448 \times 10^{-7})(1.38 \times 10^{-23})}.
\]

The numerator is:

\[
6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

The denominator is:

\[
1.448 \times 10^{-7} \times 1.38 \times 10^{-23} = 1.989 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{J·m/K}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{hc}{\lambda k} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.989 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.0 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the exponent
The exponent is:

\[
\frac{hc}{\lambda k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \
