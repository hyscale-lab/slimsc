Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what the speed of light in the glass is relative to an observer in the lab. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. Oh right, and the index of refraction is n. The speed of light in a vacuum is c=1, I remember that.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating through it in the same direction. So the light is moving with the glass, but the glass is moving towards the observer. How does that affect the speed of light we measure?

I think about the refractive index. The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed would be 1/n. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. Does that mean the speed changes? Or is it still 1/n?

Wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass as seen by the lab frame. Since the glass is moving, does the velocity of the medium (glass) affect the observed speed of light inside it? Hmm, I'm not too sure.

So in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the velocity addition formula. But wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside is moving at v_light = c/n = 1/n in the glass's frame. How do I get the speed in the lab frame?

Let me recall the velocity addition formula from relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, wait. In this case, u is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²).

Wait, no, because when the medium is moving, the light's velocity depends on the direction. Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, perhaps the velocities add. But I need to think in terms of the glass's frame and then transform to the lab frame.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Because in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is 1/n. So perhaps in the lab frame, the speed is the same as 1/n, because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. Wait, but wait, no—that's only in a vacuum. In a medium, the speed is lower. Oh wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, but in relativity, the speed of light in a medium is less than c, but it's the same in all directions for that medium.

Wait, but the glass is moving, so how does that affect the speed as measured in the lab? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, the problem is in a non-relativistic scenario, perhaps? Because the options don't look like they involve any relativity formulas. Let me see the options. The options are (1+nv)/(n
