Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to break it down step by step.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P along direction n (which lies in the x-z plane) would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines, right?

Oh right! The operator for an arbitrary direction is P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But wait, the components of n should satisfy n_x² + n_z² = 1, because it's a unit vector.

The eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Wait, no. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So I need to find the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So substituting into P:

P = n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) [[1, 0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) [n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] + n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] ]

Wait, but n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² = 1. So maybe I can parameterize it using an angle θ from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because when θ is 0, it's along z, and θ=90 is along x.

So substituting that:

n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So now, P becomes:

(ħ/2) [ cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] + sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] ]

Let me compute this matrix.

First term: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Second term: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
Adding them together:
[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]
Multiply by (ħ/2), so each element is (ħ/2) times that.

So the matrix P is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let's set up the eigenvalue equation.

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0

Subtracting (ħ/2) I from P:

P - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (cosθ - 1), sinθ ], [ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ] ]

This must be multiplied by the vector (a, b) to give zero.

So the equations are:

( (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b ) = 0

( sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b ) = 0

Hmm, these should be the same equation, so we can set up the first one.

Let me write the first equation:

(cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
=> (1 - cosθ) a = sinθ b
=> a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] * b

Wait, but 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(θ/2). And sinθ is 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) / ( 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ) ] b
= [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] b
= cot(θ/2) b

So a = cot(θ/2) b

Let me write this as a = [cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2)] b.

So the eigenvector can be written in terms of b. Let me set b = sin(θ/2). Then a = cos(θ/2).

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about this. Let me think again.

Let me parameterize the vector as |v> = (a, b). From the equation, a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b.

But let's compute [ sinθ/(1 - cosθ) ].

We can use the identity:

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)
1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)

So sinθ/(1-cosθ) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] = [cos(θ/2)]/[sin(θ/2)] = cot(θ/2)

So a = cot(θ/2) * b

So the vector is proportional to (cot(θ/2), 1).

But cot(θ/2) is [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)], so the vector is (cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2), 1) which can be written as ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ) multiplied by 1/sin(θ/2), but maybe I should factor it out.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of θ/2.

Wait, let me check the expression. The vector is (a, b) = (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), or a multiple of that.

Wait, let's test for θ=0. If θ=0, then n is along z.

Then P becomes (ħ/2) [ [1,0], [0, -1] ]

The eigenvalue +ħ/2 occurs for the state (1,0) because P_z |up> = (ħ/2)|up>.

In our expression when θ=0, θ/2=0, so cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So the vector is (1,0), which is correct. So that looks good.

Another test: θ=90 degrees, which is along x. So n_x=1, n_z=0.

Then P would be (ħ/2) [ [0,1], [1,0] ].

The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. For eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenstate is (1,1)/√2, because P_x has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>.

Using our solution, θ=90 degrees, so θ/2=45 degrees. So cos(45)=√2/2, sin(45)=√2/2.

So the vector would be (√2/2, √2/2), which is (1,1)/√2, correct. So that checks out.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

But wait, the eigenvector must be normalized. So the elements would be (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)), or perhaps scaled by some factor.

Wait, the answer options have different forms. Option C is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)). Option B is (cosθ, e^{iϕ} sinθ), but that could be for spherical coordinates. Option D includes hbar and more factors.

Wait, but in the question, the eigenvector's elements are presented as (something, something). Let's look at the options.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.

But wait, the operator is given in terms of P_x, P_y, which are 2x2 matrices. So perhaps I should write the eigenvector in terms of the basis states. But the question says the normalized eigenvector, so it should be a vector with elements based on the calculations.

Wait, but another point: the eigenvector is not unique; it's defined up to a scalar multiple. So any scalar multiple is acceptable, as long as it's normalized.

Wait, in our case, the vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is already normalized because cos² + sin² =1. So that's the normalized eigenvector.

Looking at the options:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar and some theta/2 terms. Hmm, but I don't see any hbar in the components of the eigenvector. Because the eigenvector is a state vector, which is dimensionless. So options A and D have hbar in the components, which doesn't make sense because the components should be unitless. So the correct answer can't be A or D. So that leaves B and C.

Option B uses cos(theta) and sin(theta), but in our analysis, the eigenvector components are in terms of theta/2. So option C is more likely.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed as a linear combination of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, with the direction $\vec{n}$ parameterized by an angle $\theta$ from the z-axis. The components of $\vec{n}$ are $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and the eigenvalue equation is solved for the eigenvector.

The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed as:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left[ \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} + \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \right].
\]

The eigenvalue equation $P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle$ leads to the condition:

\[
\left( P - \frac{\hbar}{2} I \right) |v\rangle = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Substituting $P$ and simplifying, the resulting matrix equation is solved for the eigenvector components $(a, b)$. Using trigonometric identities, the eigenvector is found to be proportional to:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This vector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing with the given options:

- **Option A** and **D** include $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because the components of a normalized eigenvector are dimensionless.
- **Option B** uses $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which does not match the derived components.
- **Option C** matches the derived components exactly: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
