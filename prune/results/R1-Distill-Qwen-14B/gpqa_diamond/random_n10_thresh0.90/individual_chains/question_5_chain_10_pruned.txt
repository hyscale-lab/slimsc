Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is given, but it's along an arbitrary direction. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, when you have an operator for a component like P_x, P_y, P_z, you can combine them to get the operator along any direction. The direction is given by a unit vector n, which lies in the x-z plane. So n would be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero.

The operator P along direction n would be the dot product of n with the vector operator P. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). So that would be n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P that corresponds to eigenvalue ħ/2.

Let me write down the given components of P_x, P_y, and P_z. 

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So the operator P is (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. Let me compute the matrix part first, ignoring the ħ/2 factor for a moment.

The matrix is sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

Calculating each element:

Top left: 0*sinθ + 1*cosθ → cosθ
Top right: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ → sinθ
Bottom left: 1*sinθ + 0*cosθ → sinθ
Bottom right: 0*sinθ + (-1)*cosθ → -cosθ

So the matrix becomes [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2. Wait, wait, the eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2? So setting up the equation: (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

Let me write the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I). Since P is (ħ/2) times the matrix M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], then (P - (ħ/2) I) is (ħ/2)(M) - ħ/2 I.

Factor out ħ/2: (ħ/2)(M - I).

So the matrix equation becomes (ħ/2)(M - I) |v> = 0. Since ħ/2 is non-zero, this reduces to (M - I)|v> = 0.

So let's compute M - I:

M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], subtracting identity matrix I gives:

[[cosθ - 1, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ -1]]

So the matrix for (M - I) is:

Row 1: (cosθ -1) , sinθ
Row 2: sinθ, (-cosθ -1)

We can write the equations for the eigenvectors as:

(cosθ -1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0
sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1) v2 = 0

Let me take the first equation: (cosθ-1) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0.

We can solve for v2 in terms of v1: v2 = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] v1.

But wait, let me compute (1 - cosθ) and sinθ. I remember that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2) and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So substituting, [ (2 sin²(θ/2)) / (2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) ) ] = [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) ] = tan(θ/2).

So v2 = tan(θ/2) v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, v2]^T = v1 [1, tan(θ/2)]^T.

To normalize this, we need to compute the normalization factor. The inner product should be 1.

So the vector is proportional to [1, tan(θ/2)]. Let's compute its norm squared:

1^2 + (tan(θ/2))^2 = 1 + tan²(θ/2) = sec²(θ/2) = 1 / cos²(θ/2).

So the normalization factor is cos(θ/2), because sqrt(1 / cos²(θ/2)) )= 1 / cos(θ/2), so to make the vector normalized, we multiply by cos(θ/2).

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Let's calculate the components:

The vector is [v1, v2] = v1 [1, tan(θ/2)]. Let's pick v1 as 1 for simplicity, but then normalize.

The norm squared is 1^2 + (tanθ/2)^2 = 1 + (sin²(θ/2)/cos²(θ/2)) ) = [ cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2) ) ] / cos²(θ/2) ) = 1 / cos²(θ/2).

So the norm is 1 / cos(θ/2), so the normalization factor is cos(θ/2). So the normalized vector is:

[ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, because v2 is tan(θ/2) v1. So with v1 = cos(θ/2), v2 = [ sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) ] * cos(θ/2) ) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but wait. The eigenvalue is ħ/2. But in the question, the eigenvector is given as the elements of the normalized vector. So the components are cos
