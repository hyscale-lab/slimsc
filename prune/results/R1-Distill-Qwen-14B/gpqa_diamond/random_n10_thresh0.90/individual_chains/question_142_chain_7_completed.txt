Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors (like |ψ><ψ|), but mixed states are statistical ensembles of these.

Wait, so this ρ looks like a mixture of |0> and |1>. Because it's 1/2 times each of them. So each term is (1/2)|0><0| and (1/2)|1><1|. That means it's a completely mixed state, right? Or wait, no. Because each term has the same weight, 0.5. So it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. Oh, wait, I think in the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. But wait, density matrices can also be represented in the Bloch sphere, but their position depends on their state.

For a pure state |0>, the Bloch vector is (0,0,1). Similarly, |1> would be (0,0,-1), but wait, no—wait, the Bloch sphere has three axes. The standard is x, y, z. So |0> is along the z-axis at (0,0,1), and |1> is the opposite point, (0,0,-1). But for mixed states, the density matrix has a different representation.

Wait, another approach: the density matrix can be written in terms of Pauli matrices. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. So for a state ρ, you can express it as (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. Then, the components x, y, z give the coordinates on the Bloch sphere.

So let me try to express ρ in that form. Our ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is the projector matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Wait, so ρ is (I)/2. Because (I + 0)/2, since adding |0><0| and |1><1| gives I.

Wait, because |0><0| + |1><1| = [[1,0],[0,1]] + [[0,0],[0,0]]? No, wait no. Wait, |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2.

So in that case, the density matrix is (I + 0·σx + 0·σy + 0·σz)/2. Because ρ = (I + 0)/2. Because the identity matrix is I, and the other terms are zero. So the Bloch vector r would be (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait. The identity matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So when you have ρ as (I)/2, that's (I + 0's)/2. So all the components (x, y, z) are zero. So r is (0,0,0). That would be point at the origin.

So looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but another thought: the density matrix must be a valid state, which means it must be positive semi-definite, trace 1, etc. In this case, the matrix is (I)/2, which has trace 1, since trace of I is 2, so 2*(1/2) = 1. And it's diagonal with 0.5 on the diagonal, so positive definite. So it's a valid state.

But wait, what is the geometrical position for this? So the Bloch vector is at the origin, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because it's a completely mixed state, which maximally uncertain. So the Bloch vector is zero, so the point is the origin.

So the answer should be option C: r=(0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state, where the system is in a statistical ensemble of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability of \(0.5\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general density matrix, it can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) is the Bloch vector that determines the position on the Bloch sphere.

For the given \(\rho\), we compute:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This shows that \(\rho\) corresponds to the identity matrix divided by 2, which implies that the coefficients of the Pauli matrices (\(x\), \(y\), and \(z\)) are all zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

This result is consistent with the fact that the state is maximally mixed, corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere.

**Analysis of options:**
- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not the mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0)\):** Correct, as the Bloch vector for this density matrix is at the origin.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
