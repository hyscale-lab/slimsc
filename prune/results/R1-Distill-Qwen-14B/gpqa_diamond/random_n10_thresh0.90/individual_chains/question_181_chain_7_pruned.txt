Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. The pp-III branch is one of them, right?

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So that means the neutrinos we detect now wouldn't have been affected yet because the change in the Sun's core would take that time to reach us. But wait, neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, maybe the neutrinos we're detecting now are from before that stop? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux is the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second.

I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos. Oh right, the pp-III branch emits higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. So if pp-III stopped, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would stop, but the other branches (like pp-I and pp-II) might still contribute.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in different energy ranges depending on the reaction. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos from the fusion reactions. The pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, and pp-III produces higher-energy ones. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those in the 800-900 keV band) would decrease.

But wait, the question is about neutrinos reaching Earth now. Because the Sun's core changes take time to affect the surface, but neutrinos are produced in the core. So if pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos from that process would have already been emitted before that time, but the ones detected now would be from the time after the stop, right? Or wait, no. Because the neutrinos are being produced continuously, but if the production stops, the flux from that process would drop.

Wait, neutrinos are created in the Sun's core, so if the pp-III reaction stopped, the number of neutrinos with energies from that process would decrease. But the question is about the flux ratio between two bands. So if the pp-III is responsible for more of the higher energy neutrinos, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2 more than band 1.

So normally, without the stop, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would be lower than band 1 (700-800) because higher energy neutrinos are less numerous? Or is it the other way around? Wait, neutrinos from different reactions have characteristic energies. The pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, like around 1 MeV or so. So if pp-III is stopped, then the higher energy band (band 2) would have a much lower flux compared to band 1, which is from lower energies and might be more dominated by other branches.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the energy levels. Let me think again. The main solar neutrino flux comes from the proton-proton chain, which has multiple branches. The pp-I branch primarily produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-II and pp-III branches produce higher energies. So, the pp-III is a minor contributor compared to the pp-I but produces higher-energy neutrinos.

So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) would decrease more than the lower-energy ones (band 1). So the flux in band 2 would drop, making the ratio (flux 1/flux 2) higher than before.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stopped. So the flux in band 2 would drop more than band 1. So the ratio (band1/band2) would increase.

But I'm not too sure about the exact energy ranges. Let's think about the energy distribution. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV, I think. So if band 2 is 800-900 keV, which is 0.8-0.9 MeV, that's lower than 1.4. So maybe the pp-III doesn't contribute much to band 2 either? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The pp-III branch is one of the steps in the proton-proton chain. It involves a boron-8 nucleus capturing two protons, which then decays into lithium-7 and emits a helium-4 nucleus, along with two neutrinos. Those neutrinos have higher energies, around 1.4 MeV each. So the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy than those from pp-I, which are around 0.3-0.4 MeV.

So the band 2 (800-900 keV) is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is lower than 1.4 MeV. So if the pp-III stopped, would that affect the 800-900 keV band? Maybe not as much, because the pp-III neutrinos are higher than that band.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct that. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch have energies around 1.4 MeV, so they would fall into higher energy bands, like maybe 1-2 MeV. So the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands are lower than that.

So if pp-III stopped, would that affect the lower energy bands? Hmm, maybe not directly. Because the pp-III contributes to higher energies, so the lower energy bands (like 700-800) are more influenced by other processes. So if pp-III stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop, but lower bands would stay the same. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would be higher than 1.

Wait, but if the pp-III stopped, the higher energy neutrinos would be reduced. So before the stop, the flux in band 2 (800-900) might have a certain contribution from other branches. But pp-III primarily affects higher energy bands than band 2. So if pp
