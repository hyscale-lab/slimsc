Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question gives me a meson X with production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are given in meters, with some scientific notation. Okay.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right! The uncertainty principle relates the width (Γ) to the lifetime (τ). The formula is Γ = ħ/τ. Or wait, wait, actually I think the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the energy width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

But wait, mesons are bosons, and their decay is a quantum process. So the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the mean decay distance would be the product of the velocity (v) and the lifetime (τ). Because distance is velocity multiplied by time.

So, the decay distance L = v * τ. And τ is ħ / Γ. So L = v * ( ħ / Γ ). But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Let me think about the steps.

First, calculate the lifetime τ. Then, find the velocity of the meson. Then multiply them to get the distance.

Hmm. Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute the lifetime τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson.
3. Compute L = v * τ.

So, let's start with step 1. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, I think ħ is usually given in J·s, but since the units here are in GeV, I need to use ħ in GeV·s. So yeah, ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Then, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let's see, 0.32 times 20 is 6.4. So 20.568 or so. 6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, wait, no: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25. So 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, wait, no, 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 20.568e-25 s? Wait, no, 6.582e-25 is 6.582 x 1e-25. Divided by 0.32, that's (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25. So yes, 20.568e-25 s? Or 2.0568e-24 seconds? Wait, 20.568e-25 is 2.0568e-24 s. Hmm, okay.

So, step 1 gives τ ≈ 2.0568e-24 seconds.

Now, step 2: find the velocity of the meson. How do I find that?

I think I can use the energy and mass to find the velocity. The meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the total energy is E = γ m c². Wait, because E_X is the total energy, including rest mass and kinetic energy.

So, using E = gamma * m c². So gamma (γ) = E / (m c²). But wait, units here are GeV, so perhaps I can set c=1 in these units, but I need to be careful when converting to meters.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but for the velocity, I need to compute beta, which is v/c.

So, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Or maybe it's better to compute gamma first.

Gamma is E / (m c²). But since in GeV, m is in GeV/c², and E is GeV, let's see:

Wait, E = gamma m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). But when E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so E/(m c²) would be (GeV) / ( GeV/(c²) * c² ) ) = dimensionless. So yes, gamma is E / (m c²), but in units where c is in m/s, but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute beta via beta = v = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 ) * c.

Wait, another approach: The energy E of the meson is 8 GeV. Its rest mass is m = 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma is E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

So gamma = 6.6667.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So 1/gamma squared is (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2? Wait, 6.6667 is 20/3. So 1/( (20/3)^2 ) = 9/(400) ) = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 c. Since c is about 3e8 m/s.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

But wait, perhaps more accurately, let me compute beta more precisely.

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666666...

So 1/gamma² = 1/(44.4444444) = approx 0.0225.

Wait, 6.6666667 squared is approximately 44.4444444. So 1/44.4444444 is approximately 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1/gamma squared:

gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666666667.

gamma squared is (6.6666666667)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444444444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma squared = 0.9775.

Square root of 0.9775: let me compute that.

Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Let's check: 0.9887^2 is approx 0.9775. Yes, because 0.98^2 is 0.9604, 0.988^2 is (0.98 +0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 2*0.98*0.008 + (0.008)^2 = 0.9604 + 0.01568 + 0.000064 ≈ 0.976144. Hmm, but 0.9887^2 is (0.988)^2 is 0.976144, but 0.9887^2 is a bit higher. Let me compute 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

Let me compute this step by step:

0.9887 * 0.9887.

= (0.98 + 0.0087) * (0.98 + 0.0087)
= 0.98^2 + 2 * 0.98 * 0.0087 + 0.0087^2
= 0.9604 + 2*(0.008526) + 0.00007569
= 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569
= 0.9604 + 0.01712769 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775. So yes, beta is approximately 0.9887.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * c. c is 3e8 m/s, so v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, step 3: L = v * τ.

τ is 2.0568e-24 seconds.

v is 2.966e8 m/s.

So L ≈ 2.966e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s = (2.966 * 2.0568) * 1e-16 m.

Compute 2.966 * 2.0568.

Let me compute 3 * 2.0568 = 6.1704. But 2.966 is a bit less than 3, so perhaps 2.966 * 2.0568 = ?

Wait, 2 *2.0568=4.1136, 0.966*2.0568=?

0.966 *2 =1.932, 0.966 *0.0568 ≈ 0.0550.

So 1.932 + 0.0550 = 1.987. So total is 4.1136 +1.987=6.1006. So approximately 6.1006.

So L ≈ 6.1006e-16 meters? Wait, but wait, 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16. So the product is 6.1006e-16 m.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 5.0223e-16 m

Option B:4.0655e-15

Option C:5.0223e-15

Option D:4.0655e-16

Hmm, none of the options are 6.1e-16. So I must have made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of gamma and beta is wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let's see: E is the total energy, which is 8 GeV. The rest mass energy is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c²) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the velocity calculation is more precise. Let's compute beta more accurately.

Compute beta = sqrt(1 - (m c² / E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 )= sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So that's correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the mean decay length is v * ctau, where ctau is tau multiplied by c. Because tau is in seconds, and c is in m/s.

Wait, no, the formula is L = v * τ, which is (v) [m/s] * τ [s] = m.

Wait, but if I compute c * τ, that's (3e8 m/s) * τ, which is the distance light travels in time τ, which is the c tau.

But in our case, since v is beta c, the decay length is beta c tau. So L = beta c tau.

Wait, but wait, L = v * tau = beta c tau.

So perhaps I should compute c tau first, then multiply by beta.

Alternatively, I can compute c tau and then multiply by beta.

Tau is 2.0568e-24 s.

c tau is (3e8 m/s) * 2.0568e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.0568e-24 = 6.1704e-16 meters.

Then, multiply by beta (0.9887) to get L.

So 6.1704e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ approx 6.1704 * 0.9887 = 6.1007e-16 m.

Hmm, which is about 6.1e-16 m, but the options don't have that. The closest option is A:5.0223e-16, and D:4.0655e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating tau.

Wait, let's go back to the calculation of tau. tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32:

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, which is less than 6.582 by 0.182.

0.32 * 0.56875 = 0.182, because 0.32 * 0.5 = 0.16, 0.32 * 0.0
