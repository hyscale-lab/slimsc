Okay, so I have this question about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but let me think. The question gives me the interatomic distance, which I guess is the lattice parameter 'a', right? Oh wait, wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, all the edges are equal, so a = b = c. But the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh right, for a rhombohedral, the unit cell is a cube that's been skewed in all directions, keeping a, b, c equal but angles not 90 degrees.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance (d) is calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices (hkl), the lattice parameters, and the angles. Wait, the general formula for d is (1/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(kl cos alpha) - 2(lh cos beta) )))) multiplied by (a^2) over... Oh wait, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(kl cos α) - 2(lh cos β) ) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral crystal, since a = b = c, and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma = theta), the formula might simplify. Let me plug in the values. The Miller indices here are (1,1,1) for the (111) plane.

So substituting h=1, k=1, l=1, and a=10 Angstrom, theta=30 degrees.

So let me compute the denominator part first. The denominator is the square root of [ (1^2 +1^2 +1^2) - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30) - 2*(1*1 cos30) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me make sure. The formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos γ - 2kl cos α - 2lh cos β )

But in a rhombohedral, since alpha = beta = gamma = 30, right? So all the cos terms are cos30.

So let me compute each term:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

The other terms are 2hk cos gamma, which is 2*1*1 * cos30. Since all three angles are the same, all three terms are 2 cos30.

So each of the three terms is 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) because cos30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, 2 * 1 * 1 * cos30 = 2 * cos30. So each term is 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). So three terms total would be 3*sqrt(3).

Wait no, wait. The formula is:

denominator = sqrt(3 - 2*(1*1*cos30) - 2*(1*1*cos30) - 2*(1*1*cos30) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 3*(sqrt(3)/1) )? Wait, let me compute each part:

Each of the three terms is 2 * cos30. So 3 terms: 3 * 2 * cos30.

Wait, wait, no. Let me do each step again.

So the denominator is sqrt( [h² + k² + l²] - 2hk cos gamma - 2kl cos alpha - 2 lh cos beta )

Since all angles are 30 degrees and a = b = c.

So substituting:

3 - 2*(cos30) - 2*(cos30) - 2*(cos30) ?

Wait, no, because each term is 2*(product of two indices) * cos(angle). So for (111), each of the three terms is 2*1*1*cos30 = 2*cos30.

So all three terms: 2*cos30 + 2*cos30 + 2*cos30 = 6*cos30.

So putting it all together, the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 6 * cos30.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct:

The denominator is:

(h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos gamma - 2kl cos alpha - 2 lh cos beta

So each of the three cosine terms is 2 * (indices product) * cos(theta).

So for (111), each term is 2*1*1*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3). So all three terms sum to 3*sqrt(3).

So the denominator becomes sqrt( 3 - 3*sqrt(3) )

Wait, but 3 - 3*sqrt(3) is a negative number. Because sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*1.732 is about 5.196, which is bigger than 3. So 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196. Taking the square root of a negative number isn't possible, which doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another thought: in some sources, the formula for a rhombohedral is different. Oh wait, perhaps the formula I'm recalling is for a general hexagonal system or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the interplanar spacing in terms of the unit cell parameters. Let me recall that in a general crystal system, the interplanar distance d is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos gamma)/(a²) - (2 kl cos beta)/(a²) - (2 lh cos alpha)/(a² )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha=beta=gamma=θ. So substituting:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cosθ + 2 kl cosθ + 2 lh cosθ )/(a² )

So factor out 1/a²:

1/d² = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosθ (hk + kl + lh) ) ] / a²

Then, d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 cosθ (hk + kl + lh) )

Ah, that makes more sense. So in our case, h = k = l =1, a=10 Ang, theta=30 degrees.

So compute the denominator:

(1 +1 +1) =3.

2 cos30 (1*1 + 1*1 +1*1 ) = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) * 3 = (sqrt(3)) *3.

So denominator becomes 3 - 3*sqrt(3)

Wait, but 3 - 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 -5.196 = -2.196. That's still negative. So that can't be right, because you can't have a square root of a negative number. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I messed up the formula. Maybe the formula should have the sum as 2 [ hk cos gamma + ... ] and the denominator is [h² + ... - ... ].

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos gamma + 2 kl cos beta + 2 lh cos alpha )/(a² )

But in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, so it's (2 hk cos30 + 2 kl cos30 + 2 lh cos30 ) / a².

So:

1/d² = [3 - (2 + 2 + 2) * (cos30
