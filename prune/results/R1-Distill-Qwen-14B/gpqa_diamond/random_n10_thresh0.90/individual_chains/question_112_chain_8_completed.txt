Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see if I can work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and calculating the average value of an operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state vector is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Wait, how do I normalize a vector? Oh right, I calculate the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component and then divide each component by that sum. So let's compute the normalization factor.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i), right? Let's compute their magnitudes squared. 

For (1+i), |1+i|² is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

For (2 - i), |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalized state |alpha> would be [ (1+i)/√7 ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/√7 ] |down>. 

Wait, but the problem says |alpha> is proportional to that, so that's correct—we can proceed by normalizing it.

Next, the operator's matrix representation is given. Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is 2x2 because |up> and |down> are two states. Let me write that out.

The matrix would look like:
[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0  ]

Wait, because when i≠j, the element is ħ/2. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. That makes sense.

Wait, but what are the eigenstates of this operator? Because the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate is what we’re looking for. So I think the operator is in the spin space, and since it's a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenvalues and eigenstates.

Let me find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix. The operator matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

This matrix is symmetrical, so it's diagonalizable. Let me compute its eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = 0.

So determinant of [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]] equals zero.

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ^2/4) = λ² - (ħ²/4) =0.

So λ² = ħ²/4. Taking square roots, λ = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the trace of the matrix is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2? Or wait, wait. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, the matrix is:

0   ħ/2
ħ/2 0

So the determinant equation is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (ħ/2)^2 = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So solutions λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So the eigenstates corresponding to these eigenvalues are the eigenvectors. Let me find them.

For λ = ħ/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0. So the matrix becomes:

[ -ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  -ħ/2 ]

Which simplifies to each row being -ħ/2 * [1, -1]. So the eigenvectors must satisfy v_1 = v_2. So the eigenvectors are of the form [1, 1] or any scalar multiple.

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2:

Matrix becomes:

[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2   ħ/2 ]

Each row is ħ/2 [1,1]. So the eigenvectors satisfy v_1 = -v_2. So eigenvectors are [1, -1].

Wait, but wait, let me normalize them. For the first eigenvalue (λ= ħ/2), the eigenvector is [1,1]. Its normalization is 1/sqrt(2). So the eigenstate is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -ħ/2, the eigenstate is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the operator's eigenstates are these two.

Now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the computational basis (|up>, |down>). We need to find the probability that a measurement of the operator yields each eigenvalue. That is, project |alpha> onto each eigenstate of the operator and square the magnitude to get the probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator has eigenstates |+> and |->, where |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), then the probabilities are |< + |alpha>|² and |< - |alpha> |².

So let me compute these inner products.

First, let's express |alpha> in normalized form. |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the inner product < + | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [<up| + <down| ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Which is (1/sqrt(2*7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] 

Wait, because <up|up> is 1, <up|down> is 0, etc. So when you expand, you get (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*1 divided by sqrt(14).

So (1+i +2 -i) = 3. So the inner product is 3/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is |3/sqrt(14)|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64. Wait, but let me compute 9/14. 14*0.64 is 8.96, close to 9, so it's about 0.642857, which is around 0.64.

Wait, but let me check: 9/14 is exactly 0.642857... So that's the first probability.

Then the second probability is 1 - 9/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571428, which is approximately 0.36.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the inner product < + | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, because |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So < + | alpha > is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 1 ] / sqrt(7) ?

Wait, no, because <up| + <down| acting on |alpha> would be (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. The inner product is < + | alpha > equals (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ), all divided by sqrt(7).

So expanding that:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(7).

But <up|up> is 1, <down|up> is 0, <up|down> is 0, <down|down> is 1. So:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)(1) + (2-i)(0) + (1+i)(0) + (2-i)(1) ] / sqrt(7) 

Simplify:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) 

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [3] / sqrt(7) = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So the probability is (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. So about 0.64, and the other probability is 5/14 ≈ 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, so that's possible. Now, what about the average value of the operator?

The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, the average can be found by summing the eigenvalues multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Because in the eigenbasis of A, the state can be written as a combination of |+> and |->, and the expectation value is the sum of (eigenvalue * probability).

So since the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, and their probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 respectively, the average would be ( (ħ/2)(9/14) ) + ( (-ħ/2)(5/14) ) ) = (9 -5) ħ/(2*14) )= (4 ħ)/(28) )= ħ/(7). So <A> is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average ħ/7. So that would fit.

Wait, but let me compute <A> another way, just to make sure. Maybe I'll compute it as the trace or matrix approach.

Wait, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

So let's compute that. Let's write |alpha> as a column vector.

|alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So A is [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].

So A|alpha> is:

First component: (0)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 - i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Second component: (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7).

So <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

So let's compute it as:

[ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Multiply each term.

First element: (1 - i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (1 - i)(2 -i) * ħ/(2*7).

Second element: (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * (ħ/2)(1 +i)/sqrt(7) = (2 + i)(1 +i) * ħ/(2*7).

So sum these two.

Compute (1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 =1 +3i.

So adding the two parts:

(1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) = 2.

So the sum is 2 * ħ/(2*7) )= ħ/(7).

Yes, same result. So the average is indeed ħ/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 (about 0.64) and 5/14≈0.357 (about 0.36), and average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and ħ/7. So that would match.

But wait, another thought: when I compute 9/14, it's exactly 0.642857... so in the options, it's given as 0.64. But option A has 0.64, 0.36. So that should be correct.

So the correct answer would be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state described by \( |\alpha\rangle \), proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator \( A \) with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \hbar/2 \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the magnitudes of the coefficients:
- \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \),
- \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The total normalization factor is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \hbar/2 \\
\hbar/2 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \), which gives \( \lambda = \pm \hbar/2 \). The corresponding eigenstates are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probability of measuring the eigenstate \( |+\rangle \) is given by:
\[
P(+\rangle) = |\langle +|\alpha\rangle|^2.
\]
Substituting \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |+\rangle \):
\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
P(+\rangle) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]
Similarly, the probability of measuring \( |-\rangle \) is:
\[
P(-\rangle) = 1 - P(+\rangle) = 1 - \frac{9}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha| A |\alpha\rangle.
\]
Using the eigenbasis representation, the average value is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \lambda_+ P(+\rangle) + \lambda_- P(-\rangle),
\]
where \( \lambda_+ = \hbar/2 \) and \( \lambda_- = -\hbar/2 \). Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9}{14} + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \hbar/7 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
