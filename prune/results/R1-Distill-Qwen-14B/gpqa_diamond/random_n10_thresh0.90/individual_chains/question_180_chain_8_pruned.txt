Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I'm thinking this is an electrostatic problem involving potential energy. Since the charges are fixed (except the 13th one, which is fixed at P), the potential energy of the system depends on the configuration of these charges.

Wait, so the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, which is where the 13th charge is located. So each of those 12 charges is 2 m away from the 13th charge.

But wait, wait. The problem says 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of those 12 is a distance of 2 m from P. So they all lie on a sphere of radius 2 m centered at P. But the 13th charge is fixed at P.

So the system consists of 13 charges: one fixed at P, and 12 arranged symmetrically on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P.

But wait, wait a second. Oh, wait, no. Because if the 13th charge is at P, and each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P, then each of those 12 is 2 m away from the 13th charge. So all 12 are the same distance from the 13th.

But since they're identical charges, each pair of those 12 would also interact with each other. So the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but in an isolated system, the potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So I need to
