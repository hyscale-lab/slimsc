Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Right, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react to form the acetate ion and water.

The question says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should find the initial concentration after dilution. Because when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes. So the initial acetic acid volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water. So total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume in liters. Oh wait, units need to be consistent. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume. That's 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but when you titrate, you're adding NaOH which is a strong base. So at any point, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. So the moles of NaOH needed would equal the moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially is 0.001. So moles of NaOH needed would be 0.001. Volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration. NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So first, let's tackle the 25% point. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³ (since equivalence is 10 cm³). So at 2.5 cm³, how much NaOH has reacted with the acetic acid?

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH reacts with one mole of acetic acid, this would convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

Initially, we had 0.001 moles of CH3COOH and 0 in the solution (since NaOH is being added). After adding 2.5 cm³, which is 0.0025 L, the moles of NaOH added is 0.00025. So the reaction would produce 0.00025 moles of acetate. So:

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total solution volume is original 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, this is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5. Let's compute pKa: log(1.85e-5) is about 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is ~0.267, so 5 - 0.57 ≈ 4.43? Wait, wait, let me compute it accurately.

Wait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x10^-5. Taking log: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647).

Let me compute the ratio: 0
