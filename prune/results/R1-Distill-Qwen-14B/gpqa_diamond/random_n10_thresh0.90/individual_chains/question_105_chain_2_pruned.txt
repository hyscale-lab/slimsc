Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem states that this situation can mimic an exoplanet's signal in photometric observations. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm, so normally, when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But in this case, the star's spots are causing a similar effect. So I need to calculate the effective change in brightness due to the spots and then figure out what planet size would cause the same change.

Wait, but wait. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, they make the star appear dimmer. When the star rotates and the spots move away, the brightness goes back up. So the brightness variation is due to the spots' temperature difference.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so 5000K. The spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total coverage is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface. Or wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, what does "filling factor" mean? Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, and the filling factor is 20%, then the spots cover 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface.

So the area covered by spots is 10% of the star's surface. Now, each spot is cooler, so the total flux from the star when the spots are visible will be less than when they're not.

The star's total luminosity is L = 4πR²σT^4. But when the spots are present, the flux is lower in those regions.

Wait, but when we're looking at the star, the total flux is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. So let me model this.

The star's total flux without spots: F_total = σT^4. But wait, no, flux is per unit area. The star's luminosity is 4πR²σT^4. When part of its surface is cooler, the total flux would be (unspotted area * T_star^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4) / (total area) * 4πR²σ.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the relative change in brightness when the spots are visible, compared to when they're not.

But wait, the star is rotating, so as the spots come into view, the observed flux changes. So when the spots are on the near side (facing us), the observed flux is lower. When the star rotates, the spots go to the far side, and the full unspotted surface is visible.

But the problem says that the variation in brightness is periodic and resembles an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots is similar to that caused by a planet.

So I need to compute the fractional change in brightness (ΔF/F) caused by the spots, and set that equal to the fractional change caused by a planet transiting, then solve for the planet radius.

The fractional change when a planet transits is (R_planet / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is πR_p², and the star's area is πR_star². So (R_p/R_star)^2 is the fractional dip.

But for the spots, the change is a bit different. When the spots are on the side facing us, their lower flux contributes to a lower total flux. So the total flux when spots are visible is F = F_unspotted + F_spots.

F_unspotted is the flux from the unspotted regions, and F_spots is the flux from the spots.

Each part contributes according to their area and temperature.

The star's total area is A = 4πR². When a fraction f of the surface is covered by spots, the area of spots is f * A.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the filling factor is 20% on one hemisphere. So the total area of spots is (filling factor) * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Because the hemisphere area is 2πR².

So the area of the spots is 0.4πR², and the area of the unspotted part is 4πR² - 0.4πR² = 3.6πR².

The flux when the spots are facing us is F = (3.6πR² * T_star^4 + 0.4πR² T_spot^4) / (4πR²) * 4πR²σ ?

Wait, no, let me think again. The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = σT_eff^4 * 4πR^2.

When spots are present on a fraction of the surface, the flux becomes F = σ [ (A_unspotted * T_star^4) + (A_spots * T_spot^4) ) ] / A_total.

But since A_total is 4πR², and A_unspotted is 3.6πR², and A_spots is 0.4πR².

So F = σ [ (3.6πR² T^4) + (0.4 π R² (T-1000)^4) ) ] / (4πR² ) ?

Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me try to calculate the fractional change.

The fractional change in flux (ΔF) when the spots are present is (F_with_spots - F_without_spots) / F_without_spots.

F_without_spots is F0 = σ T^4 * 4πR².

F_with_spots is σ [ (3.6π R² T^4) + (0.4 π R² T_spot^4) ] / (4πR² ) * 4πR² ?

Wait, no. Let me model it correctly.

The total flux from the star when the spots are visible is the sum of fluxes from unspotted and spotted regions.

The unspotted area is 3.6 π R², each square meter emits σ T^4.

The spots area is 0.4 π R², each square meter emits σ (T - 1000)^4.

So the total flux is F = [3.6 π R² * σ T^4 ] + [0.4 π R² * σ (T-1000)^4 ].

But F0 (without spots) is [4 π R² σ T^4 ].

So the fractional change is [F - F0] / F0 = [ (3.6 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4 ) - 4 T^4 ] / (4 T^4 )

Simplify numerator: 3.6 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4 -4 T^4 = -0.4 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4

Factor out 0.4: 0.4 [ (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ]

So ΔF/F = [0.4 ( (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ) ] / (4 T^4 ) )

Simplify denominator: 4 T^4

Wait, wait, let me compute:

ΔF/F = [ (3.6 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4 ) - 4 T^4 ] / (4 T^4 )
= [ -0.4 T^4 + 0.4 (T-1000)^4 ] / (4 T^4)
= 0.4 [ (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ] / (4 T^4)
= [ (T-1000)^4 - T^4 ] / (10 T^4 )

Hmm, that's the fractional change. Let me plug in the numbers.

T = 6000 K, so T_spot = 5000 K.

Compute (5000^4 - 6000^4) / (10 * 6000^4 )

Wait, 5000 is 5/6 of 6000. Let me calculate 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So ( (5/6 T)^4 - T^4 ) / (10 T^4 ) = [ (5/6)^4 T^4 - T^4 ] / (10 T^4 )

Factor out T^4:

[ ( (5/6)^4 - 1 ) T^4 ] / (10 T^4 ) ) = ( (5/6)^4 - 1 ) / 10

Compute (5/6)^4:

5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296.

So 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So (0.482253 - 1) = -0.517747.

Divide by 10: -0.0517747.

So ΔF/F ≈ -0.05177. So approximately a 5.177% decrease in brightness when the spots are visible.

Wait, but wait, the star's brightness when the spots are visible is lower, so the fractional change is negative. But the amplitude is the absolute value. So the amplitude is about 5.177%.

Wait, but wait, this is the change in flux when the spots are present. So the maximum dip is about 5% of the star's brightness.

So the amplitude is ~5.18%.

Now, the problem says that a hypothetical exoplanet would produce the same amplitude. So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p / R_star)^2. So we set (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.05177.

So R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but that would be approximately 0.23, but looking at the options, A is ~0.39, D is ~0.32. Hmm, none of the options are near 0.23.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the filling factor. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, and when the star rotates, half the time we see the spots, and the other half, we don't. Wait, no, no. Wait, the star's rotation brings the spots into view. So when the spots are facing us, the brightness is lower; when they're on the far side, the brightness is higher. So the average brightness is somewhere in between.

Wait, but wait, the problem says: "As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation."

So the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. The maximum dip is when the spots are fully in view, the maximum brightness is when the spots are on the far side.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when the spots are on our side, the brightness is lower. So the brightness variation is between F_with_spots and F_without_spots.

But when the spot is on the far side, the entire unspotted hemisphere is visible, but the other hemisphere (which is not spotty) is also visible. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, so when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the near side; when it rotates 180 degrees, the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, so the near side is the unspotty hemisphere.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The star emits light from all its surface, so when a hemisphere is spotty, the unspotty hemisphere is the other half. So when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, we see spots on the near side, and the unspotty hemisphere is on the far side. But that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no, perhaps I misrepresented how the star looks. Let's think: the star's surface has two hemispheres. One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area. The other hemisphere is completely unspotted.

So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². The unspotted area is 4πR² - 0.4π R² = 3.6π R².

When the star is viewed such that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is from the spotty hemisphere plus the unspotty hemisphere on the far side.

Wait, no, no, when you look at the star,
