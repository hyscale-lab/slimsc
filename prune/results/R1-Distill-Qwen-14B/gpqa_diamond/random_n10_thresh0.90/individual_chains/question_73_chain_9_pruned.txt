Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving in the positive x-direction at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. You can't just subtract 0.6c and 0.5c and think that's the relative speed. Oh right, I think you need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is something like (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)).

So let me assign the velocities. Let's say astronaut A has mass 2m and velocity u = 0.6c. Astronaut B has mass 3m and velocity v = 0.5c. Wait, but relative speed depends on the frame of reference. Since they are moving in the same direction, I think the relative speed of B from A's frame is (u' = (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) )? Wait, actually, no. Wait, the relative velocity formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but I need to be careful about the direction. Because u is the velocity of the first object, and v is the velocity of the second. So if I'm in the frame of astronaut A, what is the speed of astronaut B?

Wait, no, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. When you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative velocity is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)) ). So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, so from A's point of view, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) ). Wait, that would be negative. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) over 1 minus (0.5c *0.6c)/(c²). Let me calculate that.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, in the scenario, A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c. So in the rest frame of A, what's B's velocity? The formula is (u' = (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)) ), where u is the velocity of the frame (A's velocity in the lab frame), and v is B's velocity in the lab frame. So u would be 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. So u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²) ). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: (0.5 -0.6)c= (-0.1)c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1-0.3=0.7. So u' is (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.142857 c. The negative sign indicates direction, but relative speed is the magnitude, so 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c, which is 0.142857c or 1/7 c exactly, since 0.142857 is 1/7.

Looking at the options, option C and D have relative speed 0.14c. So that's either C or D. Now the total energy—wait, the problem says 'the total energy of the system.' Hmm, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of the relativistic energies of each object.

Each object's energy is gamma times m c squared. So for astronaut A, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)). So for A: v=0.6c, so v²/c² is 0.36. So 1 - 0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E_A = gamma * m c² * mass, so 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, wait. Wait, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so his energy would be gamma * (2m) c². So for A: gamma is 1.25, so 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So gamma is 1/0.866≈1.1547. So E_B = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy is E_A + E_B ≈ 2.5 +3.464 = 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that matches.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation for the energy. So for A: 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1-0.36)=1/0.8=1.25. E_A=1.25 * (2m) c²=2.5 m c². Correct. For B: 0.5c, gamma=1/sqrt(1-0.25)=sqrt(4/3)=approx 1.1547. So E_B= 1.1547 *3m c²=3.464 m c². So sum is 2.5+3.464=5.964 mc². So that's option C.
