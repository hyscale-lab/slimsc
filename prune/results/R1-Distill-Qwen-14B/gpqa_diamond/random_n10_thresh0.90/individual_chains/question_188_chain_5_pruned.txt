Okay, so today I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure, especially in terms of the unit cell and Miller indices.

Wait, the problem gives me a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, no—wait, rhombohedral means all edges are equal, right? So it's a special case where a = b = c, and all angles α, β, γ are equal. In this case, they're all 30 degrees. But wait, isn't that a bit unusual? Because in a rhombohedral system, the angles are typically equal but less than 90 degrees, I think. Oh, wait, no—rhombohedral can have angles like 60 degrees for something like a diamond structure. But 30 degrees seems quite sharp. Anyway, that's what's given here.

The task is to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. I remember that the formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law formula, but wait, no, Bragg's law is about the angles for reflection. Oh right, the interplanar distance formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something related to the angles?) Or wait, that formula is for cubic systems. But since this is rhombohedral, the formula must be more general.

Oh, right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma) + 2(hl \cos \beta) + 2(kl \cos \alpha)}}}

Wait, but wait, since the crystal is rhombohedral, α = β = γ. So that simplifies the formula. Let me double-check: in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a (let's say), and all angles α, β, γ are equal to some angle θ. So substituting all equal angles into the general formula.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cosθ
