Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read through it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The problem says that because of these spots, the star's brightness variations mimic those of a planet transiting the star. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as this spotted star?

Hmm. So I need to find Rpl/Rstar, the planet's radius relative to the star's radius.

I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness (the transit depth) is proportional to (Rpl/Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet compared to the star's disk.

But in this case, the star's spots are causing a variation. So I guess the spots make the star appear dimmer in certain regions, and as the star rotates, those spots come into and out of view. But wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variations due to the spots look like a planet's transit. So the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots should be equivalent to the variation from a planet.

Wait, but the star's brightness variation from spots is different from a planet's. When a planet transits, the star's brightness drops because a part of the star is blocked. But when spots rotate in and out of view, the star's brightness appears to vary because the spots are cooler.

So, the key is to calculate the change in brightness due to the spots and compare it to the change due to a planet blocking part of the star's light.

Let me think about the star's brightness first. The star's total luminosity when not spotted is L = 4πR^2 σ T^4, where R is the star's radius and T its effective temperature. But when spots are present, the effective temperature in those spots is lower, so the total luminosity changes.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So each spot might vary, but the filling factor is 0.2 for each hemisphere. Wait, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is spots. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, that's 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 or 10% of the total surface area.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. The area of the hemisphere is 2πR² (since the total surface area is 4πR², so hemisphere is half that, 2πR²). So the spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, but wait, the problem says one hemisphere, so perhaps the spots are on one side (like the star is rotating, so as it spins, that hemisphere comes into view). Wait, but regardless, the key is the total area of the spots and their temperature.

But the star's luminosity when the spots are visible would be the normal luminosity minus the contribution from the spots. Because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light.

So normally, the star emits L = 4πR²σTeff^4. When the spots are present, the emission is L' = L - (fraction of spots area) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4) * (L per unit area).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the fractional change in brightness due to the spots. Because when spots rotate into view, the star's brightness decreases, and when they rotate away, it increases.

So the maximum change would be when the spots are fully facing us. The brightness variation would be based on the difference in the flux from the spots compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, the fractional change ΔF in brightness would be [ (L_spot - L_normal_spot_area) / L_total ].

Wait, the normal spot area (without spots) would emit at Teff. The spots emit at T_spot = Teff - 1000 K. So T_spot is 5000 K.

So the flux per unit area for the spots is σ T_spot^4, and normally it's σ Teff^4.

The area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2πR², so spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

So the total normal flux is 4πR² σ Teff^4. The flux with spots is [ (4πR² σ Teff^4) - (0.4πR² σ (Teff - 1000)^4) ) ].

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the hemisphere facing us, the star's brightness is lower. So the fractional decrease in brightness is (L_normal - L_spots) / L_normal.

So, let's compute that.

L_normal = 4πR² σ T^4.

L_spots = 4πR² σ T^4 - (area_spots * σ (T - 1000)^4 )

So, the change in flux when spots are visible (compared to when they're not) is:

ΔL = L_normal - L_spots = (area_spots * σ (T^4 - (T-1000)^4 )) )

The fractional change would be ΔL / L_normal = [ area_spots * σ (T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ) ] / [4π R² σ T^4 ]

Simplify this:

The σ cancels out. So,

ΔL/L_normal = [ area_spots * (T^4 - (T-1000)^4) ] / (4π R² T^4 )

The area_spots is 0.4 π R², so:

ΔL/L_normal = [ 0.4 π R² (T^4 - (T-1000)^4) ] / (4 π R² T^4 )

The R² and π terms cancel.

So ΔL/L_normal = [ 0.4 (T^4 - (T-1000)^4) ] / (4 T^4 )

Simplify further:

0.4/4 = 0.1, so:

ΔL/L_normal = 0.1 * (T^4 - (T-1000)^4) / T^4

Factor out T^4:

= 0.1 [ (T^4 - (T^4 - 4000 T^3 + ... )) / T^4 ]

Wait, perhaps calculate (T - 1000)^4 numerically.

Given T = 6000 K, so T -1000 =5000 K.

Compute (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Compute each term:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 - 5000^4 = 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So their ratio is 6.71e14 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.518.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately:

Compute 6000^4: 6000 * 6000 = 36e6, squared is 1296e12.

5000^4: 5000*5000=25e6, squared is 625e12.

So 1296e12 - 625e12 = 671e12.

So 671e12 / 1296e12 = 671/1296 ≈ 0.518 (exactly, 671 ÷ 1296 ≈ 0.518).

So the fractional change in brightness when the spots are facing us is 0.1 * 0.518 = 0.0518 or about 5.18%.

Wait, but wait. When the star is rotating, the hemisphere with spots is only visible when it's facing us. So the maximum dip is 5.18% when all the spots are visible. Wait, but perhaps the actual brightness variation depends on the rotation. But the problem states that the star has a spot covering 20% of a hemisphere, and when it's observed, the brightness variation would be similar to a planet.

But the planet's effect is when it blocks part of the star's light. The dip is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, because it's the area blocked.

Wait, but what's the variation here? The star's brightness varies due to the spots. The amplitude of this variation is the maximum dip when the spots are fully visible. So the maximum dip is about 5.18%.

Wait, but earlier calculation was for the fractional change, ΔL/L = 0.0518.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

The fractional change is [ (T^4 - (T-1000)^4 ) ] * (area / 4π R²) * (1 / T^4 )

Wait, no, the correct approach is:

The fractional change when the spots are visible is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when spots are present.

So, the area of the spots is 0.4 π R².

The flux from the spots is σ (5000)^4 * 0.4 π R².

The total flux without spots is 4 π R² σ (6000)^4.

So the flux when spots are present is L = 4 π R² σ (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4.

So the fractional change is:

ΔL = [4 π R^2 σ (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R^2 σ (5000)^4] - 4 π R^2 σ (6000)^4 ) 

Wait no, ΔL is the change, so when the spots are present, the flux is less. So the change is the difference between L0 (normal) and L when spots are present.

So ΔL = L0 - L_spots = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The fractional change is ΔL / L0 = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

Simplify: 0.4/(4) = 0.1, and the rest cancels.

So ΔL/L0 = 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

As I computed earlier, (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 ≈ 0.518.

So fractional change is 0.1 * 0.518 ≈ 0.0518, or about 5.18% dip.

Wait, but that's the fractional change in brightness when the spots are all visible. But since the star is rotating, only a portion of the spots comes into view as it rotates, depending on the observer's perspective. Wait, no, the problem says that one hemisphere is covered, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are fully visible, leading to a 5.18% dip. When the other hemisphere (without spots) comes into view, there's no dip, so the brightness returns to normal.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so when it's rotating, the spots come into view as the star turns. But the problem says that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star's rotation brings that hemisphere into view, the spots are fully visible, and when the other hemisphere is visible, there's no dip. So the maximum dip is this 5.18%.

But the question is, if we have a planet transiting the star, what would its radius need to be to produce the same amplitude in the brightness variation.

So the planet blocks part of the star's light, causing a dip. The amplitude is (Rpl/Rstar)^2.

So the dip due to the planet is (Rpl/Rstar)^2, which should equal the dip of 5.18%, which is approximately 0.0518.

Wait, but the planet's dip is (Rpl/(Rstar))^2, and the star's dip is 0.0518. So we set (Rpl/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518.

Taking the square root, Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, that's about 0.228, but looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake. Because none of the options is near 0.228.

Wait, what's wrong here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the fractional change. Let me recompute.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So T_spot is 5000 K.

The flux from a unit area on the star is σ T^4, and from the spot it's σ (T-1000)^4.

The area of the spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Hemisphere is 2π R², so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the flux
