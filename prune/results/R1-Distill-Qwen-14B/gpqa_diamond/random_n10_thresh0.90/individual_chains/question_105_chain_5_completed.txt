Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness changes over time—this is called photometric time-series observations. These brightness variations can look like those caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. 

The question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted? So we're comparing the brightness dip due to the planet to the brightness dip caused by the spots.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness variation caused by a planet is when it blocks some of the star's light. The formula for the change in brightness (delta F) is something like the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. So, delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, that's when the planet transits directly in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness. 

But wait, the star's spots also affect the brightness. Since the spots are cooler, when they're facing towards us, the brightness should decrease because a cooler part is blocking some light. The problem is that the star has these spots on one hemisphere, so as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So the brightness variation isn't just a single dip but a periodic change as the spots rotate into and out of the observed area.

The problem says that this spot situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So we're to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star would, without the spots. So we need to calculate the amplitude caused by the spots and set that equal to the amplitude caused by the planet.

Wait, but first, how does the spot coverage affect the brightness? The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So each hemisphere is, I think, half of the star's surface. So each hemisphere has an area of (1/2) * 4π R² = 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that, so the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². 

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the spots cover 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². But the star’s total surface is 4π R², so the spot coverage is 0.4π /4π = 10% of the star's surface. Wait, no, because the spots are only on one hemisphere. So when the star is viewed, the spots only contribute when that hemisphere is facing us. But since the star is rotating, the observed spots would be in one hemisphere, so the maximum area blocked would be the area of the spots on the hemisphere when that side is facing us. 

Hmm, but perhaps the approach is to calculate the total emitted flux when the spots are facing us and when they aren't. Alternatively, maybe the average flux change caused by the spots as the star rotates.

Wait, let me think. When the star isn't spotted, the total flux from the star is F0 = 4π R² * sigma * Teff^4. Because the star emits according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

But when part of the star is covered by spots, the flux is less. The spots are cooler. So the flux from the star when a spot is visible is the normal flux minus the flux from the spot area.

Alternatively, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted regions and the spotted regions.

Wait, the star has a radius R, same as the Sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, covering 20% of that hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, and the flux is lower. When the other side is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so their effect doesn't affect the observed flux.

So the maximum and minimum fluxes would depend on the star's rotation. Let's model the brightness variation as the star rotates. The spots cause the brightness to dip when they're in view.

But to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we can compute the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, but the star emits isotropically. The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is F_spots, and when the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, the flux is F_no_spots.

Wait no, that's not exactly correct. Because the star is rotating, it's not that the entire hemisphere is facing us but that the spots are on the hemisphere that's facing us as the star rotates. Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the star's brightness variation caused by the spots as a function of the rotational phase.

Alternatively, perhaps the average brightness variation (the amplitude) can be calculated by considering the difference in flux when the spots are visible (i.e., when the star's spotted side is facing us) versus when it's not.

Wait, no. Because the spots are on one hemisphere. So as the star rotates, the spots come into view, and the brightness decreases. The brightness variation would have a maximum and a minimum, but it's a periodic change that depends on the star's rotation period.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the maximum dip in brightness when the entire spotted area is blocking the maximum light. Hmm, but that's only when the spots are directly facing us. Wait, but the star's rotation would present the spots at varying angles. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is when the spot area is fully blocking (i.e., when the center of the spot is directly in front of the star from our viewpoint.)

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum dip is the area of the spots on the hemisphere times the difference in flux between the normal star and the spots.

Wait, let me think again. The flux from the star without any spots is F0 = 4π R² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F = [ (1 - f) * F_unspotted + f * F_spotted ] * (hemisphere area factor?)

Wait, maybe not. Because each hemisphere is half the star's surface. The spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux is F = (area of unspotted part of hemisphere) * sigma T_unspotted^4 + (area of spotted part of hemisphere) * sigma T_spotted^4.

Wait, no. The star's entire surface emits. When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, part of the surface is cooler. So the total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F_spotty = (area of unspotted part of hemisphere) * sigma T_unspotted^4 + (area of spotted part of hemisphere) * sigma T_spotted^4.

The unspotted part of the hemisphere is 80% of the hemisphere's area. The hemisphere area is 2π R². So unspotted area is 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R². Spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So F_spotty = 1.6 π R² * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² * sigma (5000)^4.

Wait, because the spots are 1000 K cooler. So T_spotted = 6000 -1000 =5000 K.

The total flux without any spots (F0) is 4π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, but in the spotted case, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty as I wrote above. Then, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_unspotty = 2π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, no. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K, so F_unspotty = 2π R² * sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty, which is the sum of the unspotted part of that hemisphere and the spotted part. So F_spotty = (unspotted area) * sigma T_unspotted^4 + (spotted area) * sigma T_spotted^4.

So the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty is the change in flux when the star's spotted hemisphere comes into view.

Wait, no, because when the star rotates, the flux you see alternates between the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted. So the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us (F_unspotty), and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us (F_spotty). (Wait, no, because F_unspotty would be higher than F_spotty since the unspotted is hotter.)

Wait, yes. So the maximum flux is F_unspotty, and the minimum is F_spotty. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F0.

Wait, no, because F_unspotty is when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, so the star emits at maximum. F_spotty is when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, so the flux is lower. So the brightness variation is the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty, over F0.

Wait, but F0 is the flux when the star is completely unspotted, which isn't the case here. Wait, perhaps F0 is when the star's entire surface is at Teff=6000 K. So in our problem, the star is spotted, so the maximum flux is F_unspotty, and the minimum is F_spotty. So the amplitude is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F0.

Wait, but wait, F0 is 4π R² sigma (6000)^4.

So let me calculate F_unspotty and F_spotty.

F_unspotty = 2π R² sigma (6000)^4.

F_spotty = (0.8 * 2π R²) sigma (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2π R²) sigma (5000)^4.

So F_spotty = [1.6 π R² sigma (6000)^4] + [0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4].

So the difference in flux (delta F) is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

So delta F = [2π R² sigma (6000)^4] - [1.6 π R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4].

Simplify:

delta F = [2π - 1.6 π] R² sigma (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4.

So delta F = (0.4 π R² sigma (6000)^4) - (0.4 π R² sigma (5000)^4 ).

Factor out 0.4 π R² sigma:

delta F = 0.4 π R² sigma [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ].

Now, F0 is the total flux without any spots, which is 4π R² sigma (6000)^4.

So the fractional change (amplitude) is delta F / F0.

So delta F / F0 = [0.4 π R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [4 π R² sigma 6000^4 ].

The R², sigma, and π terms cancel out.

So:

delta F / F0 = (0.4 (6000^4 - 5000^4 )) / (4 * 6000^4 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

0.4 = 2/5, so:

delta F / F0 = ( (2/5) (6000^4 -5000^4) ) / (4 *6000^4 )

= (2/5) /4 * (6000^4 -5000^4) / (6000^4 )

= (1/10) * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4: that's (5/6)^4.

5/6 is approximately 0.8333. Let's compute 0.8333^4.

0.8333^2 = 0.6944, then square that: approximately 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So [1 - 0.4823 ] = 0.5177.

So delta F / F0 ≈ (1/10) * 0.5177 = 0.05177, or about 5.177% amplitude.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem states that the situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So the amplitude caused by the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because the dip in brightness when the planet transits is (area of planet)/(area of star) = (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So if the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is 5.177%, then the exoplanet would cause the same amplitude. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177.

Therefore, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ sqrt(0.05177).

Let me compute that. 0.05177 is approximately 0.0518.

The square root of 0.0518: since sqrt(0.04) is 0.2, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3. Let's compute 0.228^2 = 0.051984, which is about 0.052. So sqrt(0.0518) is about 0.2276.

Wait, wait, no. Because 0.2276 squared is (approx) 0.0518. So sqrt(0.0518) ≈ 0.2276.

Wait, but 0.2276 squared is approximately 0.0518. Yes. So Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.228.

But wait, the options given are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, none of these options are near 0.228. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, the problem states that the star's radius is equal to the Sun's. So Rstar = R_sun.

The exoplanet's radius is Rp. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 = (Rp/R_sun)^2.

Wait, wait, the way I computed delta F is when the star's spotted hemisphere is facing us. But when the star is rotating, the amplitude is the difference between maximum and minimum flux over F0. So perhaps I should compute the peak-to-peak amplitude and then find the equivalent planet.

Wait, but in the case of the planet, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which would be the fractional dip in brightness. So I set that equal to the delta F / F0 I computed, which is about 5.177%.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276. So about 0.228 R_sun.

But wait, the options don't have 0.228. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the variation in brightness is not just the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty, but perhaps a more complex function due to the star's rotation and the spot's position.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: when the star has spots, the brightness variation is because when the spots rotate into view, the observed flux drops. The amplitude of this drop is the difference between the flux when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude caused by the spots is the same as the dip of a planet. So the dip when the planet transits is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Setting this equal to the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but let's think about the actual dip. When the planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So if that dip is equal to the dip caused by the spots, then (Rp/Rstar)^2 = fractional dip from the spots.

In the spot scenario, the dip is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

Wait, earlier, I calculated delta F as F_unspotty - F_spotty = 0.4 pi R² sigma [6000^4 -5000^4 ].

Wait, but F0 is the total flux without any spots, which is 4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

So delta F / F0 = [0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 )] / [4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 ] = 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 )

Hmm, as before, which gave me about 5.177%.

So the dip is ~5.18% of the star's flux.

So the planet's dip would be (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0518 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.227, which is about 0.23.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the flux difference.

Wait another thought: perhaps the observed amplitude is not the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty, but the difference between the maximum and minimum fluxes when the star is rotating.

Wait, when the star rotates, the maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible.

So F_max = F_unspotty = 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

F_min = F_spotty = (0.8 * 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4) + (0.2 * 2 pi R² sigma (5000)^4).

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) divided by F0.

Wait, let me compute this.

F_max = 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

F_min = (1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4).

So F_max - F_min = [2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4] - [1.6 pi R² sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4 ]

Which is (0.4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4) - (0.4 pi R² sigma (5000)^4 )

= 0.4 pi R² sigma [ (6000^4) - (5000^4) ]

F0 = 4 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

So (F_max - F_min) = 0.4 pi R² sigma [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ]

So (F_max -F_min)/F0 = [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 *6000^4 ]

= [0.4 ( (6^4 -5^4 ) * 1000^4 ) ] / [4 *6^4 * 1000^4 ]

Simplify 1000^4 cancels out.

= 0.4 * (1296 - 625) / (4 * 1296 )

Wait, 6^4 is 1296, 5^4 is 625.

So 1296 -625 = 671.

So numerator: 0.4 * 671 = 268.4.

Denominator: 4 * 1296 = 5184.

So (F_max -F_min)/F0 = 268.4 / 5184 ≈ 0.0517, or 5.17%.

So same result as before.

So the amplitude is approximately 5.17% of the star's brightness.

Now, the planet transit causes a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2. So set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.0517) ≈ 0.2275, or about 0.228.

Looking at the options, none of them are close to 0.228. The options are 0.39, 0.07, 0.11, 0.32.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis. Let me think again.

Wait, wait a minute! Because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, but that's the fractional change. So if the dip caused by the spots is 5.17%, then the planet would have a dip of 5.17%, which would mean (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.0517 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude in brightness variation due to the spots is not F_max - F_min, but the peak-to-peak variation is 2 times the amplitude. Or perhaps the way the flux is computed is different.

Wait another thought: perhaps the star's brightness variation isn't a single dip but a sinusoidal variation as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude would then be half the peak-to-peak variation. So perhaps I should compute the amplitude correctly.

Wait, no. The maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, and the maximum brightness is when they're not. So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min) over F0, which is what I did before.

Hmm, perhaps the star's rotation causes the spots to appear and disappear, leading to a variation in brightness. But the problem says the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So perhaps the amplitude from the spots is similar to the dip caused by a planet.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the effective temperature of the entire star including the spots. But I'm not sure.

Wait another approach: perhaps the total flux when the star is spotted is F = F0 * (1 - f + f * (T_spot / T_star)^4 ), where f is the filling factor.

Wait, but that's a simplification. Let's see.

The filling factor f is 0.2, and the spots are cooler. So the total flux emitted when the spots are in view is F = F0 * (1 - f + f * (T_spot / T_star)^4 )

So F = F0 [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot / T_star)^4 ]

When the spots are not in view (other hemisphere), F = F0.

So the variation in flux would be between F0 and F.

So the amplitude would be (F0 - F) / F0 = 1 - [ (1-f) + f (T_spot/T_star)^4 ].

Let me compute this.

1 - [ (1-0.2) + 0.2 (5000/6000)^4 ]

= 1 - [0.8 + 0.2 * (0.8333)^4 ]

As before, (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.4823 = 0.8 + 0.09646 = 0.89646.

So 1 - 0.89646 = 0.10354, about 10.35% dip.

Wait, that's a different result. Hmm, but this approach may be oversimplified. Because the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the observed flux varies between F0 and F (as computed above).

Wait, but this approach would give a dip of about 10.35% when the spots are in view. That's different from the 5.17% I computed earlier. So which one is correct?

Wait, no, because the filling factor is 0.2 on the hemisphere. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = F0 * (1 - f + f (T_spot / T_star)^4 ), as I did.

Wait, but when the other hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F0. So the maximum flux is F0, and the minimum is F = F0 * [0.8 + 0.2*(0.8333)^4 ].

So the dip is (F0 - F)/F0 = 1 - [0.8 + 0.2*(0.8333)^4 ] ≈ 1 - 0.89646 = 0.10354, so 10.35%.

But earlier, when I considered F_unspotty and F_spotty, the dip was about 5.17%. So which is correct?

Hmm. I think the confusion arises because the spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F. When the other hemisphere is facing, the flux is F0. So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F0 - F)/F0 = 10.35%?

But wait, that would imply a larger dip than the 5% I computed earlier. So perhaps this approach is correct, but I'm not quite sure.

Well, if I take this approach, (F0 - F)/F0 = 10.35% → 0.1035.

Then, setting that equal to (Rp/Rstar)^2 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217.

So approximately 0.32, which is option D.

Hmm, that's one of the options. So maybe this is the correct approach.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Because in the first approach, I considered the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us and the unspotted hemisphere. But perhaps that's not the correct way to model it. Maybe I should model the entire star as having a certain fraction of spots, but spread over the entire surface. Wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots, so the spots are only on one side.

But the filling factor is a measure of the area covered, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire spot area is visible, leading to a dip in flux. When the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are on the far side, so no dip.

So the maximum flux is F0, the minimum is F = F0 * [ (1 - f) + f (T_spot / T_star)^4 ].

So the dip is (F0 - F)/F0 = 1 - [ (1-f) + f (T_spot / T_star)^4 ]

Which in numbers is 1 - [0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4 ] = 1 - [0.8 + 0.2*(0.482253)].

Compute 0.2 * 0.482253 = 0.0964506.

So 0.8 + 0.0964506 = 0.8964506.

So 1 - 0.8964506 = 0.1035494 → 10.35% dip.

So this approach gives a dip of about 10.35%. Therefore, the planet's dip (Rp/Rstar)^2 is 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3217, which is option D: ~0.32.

But earlier, when I computed the flux as the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas on the hemisphere, I got a 5.17% dip. I'm confused as to why there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by assuming that F_unspotty is 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4. Because when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the other hemisphere (with spots) is on the far side, so the flux is indeed F_unspotty = 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

But when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = (0.8 * 2 pi R² sigma 6000^4) + (0.2 * 2 pi R² sigma 5000^4 ). So the maximum and minimum fluxes are as I calculated, leading to a dip of about 5.17%.

But in the second approach, the dip is about 10.35%. I'm getting conflicting results.

Wait, perhaps the first approach is correct because when the star is rotating, the maximum flux is when the unspotted hemisphere is fully visible, and the minimum is when the spotted hemisphere is fully visible. So the dip is 5.17%.

But why does the second approach give a larger dip?

Ah, perhaps I'm mixing up the filling factor. The problem states that the filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the area is 0.2 * (2 pi R^2) = 0.4 pi R^2. So when the hemisphere is facing us, the area covered by spots is 0.4 pi R², which is 10% of the entire star's surface (since 4 pi R² is the total surface area).

Wait, but when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.4 pi R² is visible. So the flux from the star is:

Flux = (unspotted area)*sigma T_unspotted^4 + (spotted area)*sigma T_spotted^4.

Which is (2 pi R² - 0.4 pi R²) * sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 pi R² * sigma (5000)^4.

So that's (1.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4 ) + (0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 )

Which simplifies to 2 pi R² sigma [ 0.8 * 6000^4 + 0.2 *5000^4 ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recompute.

Wait, the total flux would be:

F_spotty = (unspotted area) * T_unspotted^4 + (spotted area) * T_spotted^4.

Which is (1.6 pi R²) * (6000^4 ) + (0.4 pi R²) * (5000^4 )

So F_spotty = pi R² (1.6 * 6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4 )

F_unspotty = 2 pi R² *6000^4.

So the dip is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) = 2 pi R² 6000^4 - [pi R² (1.6*6000^4 + 0.4*5000^4 ) ]

= pi R² [ 2 *6000^4 - 1.6 *6000^4 -0.4 *5000^4 ]

= pi R² [ 0.4 *6000^4 - 0.4 *5000^4 ]

= 0.4 pi R² (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Which is the same as before. So then the dip is 0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 ) = 0.1*( (6^4 -5^4 ) /6^4 )

As before, 6^4=1296; 5^4=625. So (1296-625)=671.

So 0.1 * (671 / 1296) ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 → 0.05177.

So 5.177% dip.

So the dip is about 5.177%, so the planet's dip is the same, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait another thought: perhaps the star's effective temperature is not the same as the unspotted regions. Because the spots are cooler, maybe the star's overall effective temperature is lower. But the problem states that the star's Teff is 6000 K, so perhaps that's the average.

Wait, but the problem says that the star has an effective temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the unspotted regions are at 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K.

So when the spots are facing us, the total flux is lower, but the star's overall Teff is 6000 K because that's the average. So perhaps the approach I took initially is correct.

But then why the discrepancy in the two approaches?

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the actual flux and the apparent dip. Let me think: when the star is spotted, the average flux would be lower than F0. But when the star isn't spotted, the flux is F0. So the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the maximum dip is when the spots are fully visible, which is about 5.177%.

So to find the exoplanet's radius that would cause the same dip, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2276.

But the options don't have this. Hmm. Maybe I should check the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.39

B) ~0.07

C) ~0.11

D) ~0.32

Wait, maybe I made a computational error in the dip calculation.

Let me recalculate (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4.

Compute 6000^4: 6^4=1296 → 6000^4 = 1296 *1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4: 5^4=625 → 5000^4=625 *1e12=6.25e14.

So (6000^4 -5000^4 ) = 1.296e15 - 0.625e15 = 0.671e15.

So (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 = 0.671e15 / 1.296e15 ≈ 0.5177.

So 0.4 * 0.5177 = 0.20708.

Then, 0.20708 / (4 * 6000^4 ) / (4 *6000^4 ) → wait, no.

Wait, the dip expression was [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (4 *6000^4 )

Which is [0.4 * 0.671e15 ] / (4 * 1.296e15 )

= (0.2684e15 ) / (5.184e15 )

= 0.2684 /5.184 ≈ 0.0517 → 5.17%.

So I think that's correct.

So the dip is ~5.17%.

So exoplanet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0517 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.2276.

But options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is different.

Wait, perhaps the star's overall effective temperature is not 6000 K, but the average of the spotted and unspotted regions. So the star's Teff is determined by the sum of the flux from all areas.

Wait, the effective temperature is defined such that the total flux from the star is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4.

In the spotted case, the total flux would be F = [ (1-f) * (Teff)^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] *4 pi R^2 sigma.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the star's surface has two regions: unspotted at Teff and spotted at T_spot. So the total flux is F = ( (1-f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ) *4 pi R^2 sigma.

Wait, but that's the same as F0 when there are no spots, so with spots, F would be less.

But the problem states that the star's Teff is 6000 K. So perhaps the calculation of the star's flux is based on that.

Wait, but in reality, the star's Teff is determined by the total emitted flux. So the presence of spots would lower the total flux, but the problem states that the star's Teff is 6000 K, which implies that without spots, the flux is F0 =4 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4. But with spots, the total flux is F = (unspotted area * Teff_unspotted^4 + spotted area * T_spot^4 ) * sigma.

Wait, but the star's Teff is given as 6000 K; so perhaps the star's overall flux is F0, and the spots cause a variation in the observed flux as the star rotates.

So perhaps the approach should be to compute the average flux of the star, which is F0, and then the variation in flux when the spots are visible.

Wait, let me think. The star emits F0 =4 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = sum of (unspotted and spotted areas) as before. So F_spotty = (0.8 *2 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 *2 pi R^2 sigma (5000)^4 )

= 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma (4800 + 1000 ) *1e12 → Wait, 6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = (6^4)(1e3)^4 = 1296e12, and 5000^4=625e12.

Wait, perhaps better to compute each term numerically.

So 0.8 *6000^4 = 0.8 *1296e12 = 1036.8e12.

0.2 *5000^4 = 0.2 * 625e12 = 125e12.

So F_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma (1036.8e12 + 125e12 ) = 2 pi R^2 sigma *1161.8e12.

F0 =4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 )=4 pi R^2 sigma *1296e12.

So the ratio F_spotty / F0 = [2 pi R^2 sigma *1161.8e12 ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma *1296e12 ] = (2 * 1161.8) / (4 * 1296 )

= 2323.6 / 5184 ≈ 0.447.

So F_spotty = 0.447 F0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux should be less than F0. So F_spotty would be less than F0.

Wait, wait, 1161.8e12 is less than 1296e12. So the ratio is (2 *1161.8)/(4 *1296) )= (2323.6)/(5184) ≈ 0.447. So F_spotty = 0.447 F0.

Wait, but that would imply that when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is only ~44.7% of F0. That seems too low, considering that the spots are just 20% of the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the math.

Wait, 0.8 *6000^4 = 0.8 *1296e12 = 1036.8e12.

0.2 *5000^4 = 0.2 *625e12=125e12.

So sum is 1036.8e12 +125e12=1161.8e12.

So F_spotty = 2 pi R^2 sigma *1161.8e12.

F0 =4 pi R^2 sigma *1296e12.

So F_spotty /F0 = (2 *1161.8) / (4 *1296 )

Because (2 pi R^2 sigma *1161.8e12 ) / (4 pi R^2 sigma * 1296e12 )= (2 * 1161.8 )/(4 * 1296 )

= (2323.6) / (5184) ≈ 0.447.

So F_spotty =0.447 F0.

But earlier, when the star's other hemisphere is facing us, the flux was F_unspotty=2 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 )=2 pi R^2 sigma *1296e12.

So F_unspotty /F0 = (2 pi R^2 sigma *1296e12 )/(4 pi R^2 sigma *1296e12 )= 2/4 = 0.5.

So F_unspotty=0.5 F0.

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.447 F0.

So the dip is F_unspotty - F_spotty = 0.5 F0 - 0.447 F0 = 0.053 F0.

So the dip is 5.3% of F0.

Which is close to my initial calculation of 5.17%.

So the amplitude is approximately 5.3%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.053 → Rp/Rstar≈0.23.

But again, the options don't have this value.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the variation in brightness when the star is being observed, and that variation is similar to the planet's transit.

Wait, could there be another factor I'm missing, like the fact that the exoplanet transits across the star's disk, causing a dip proportional to the area, but the spots are on one hemisphere, so the maximum dip is when the spot area is fully blocking.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation caused by the star's rotation as a periodic signal with an amplitude similar to a planet transit.

But I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options given are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Wait, if the dip is 5.17%, then the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.0517)=0.227, which is approximately 0.23. But none of the options are close. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the star's spots as causing a variation in brightness that's similar to an exoplanet causing a variation in the same amplitude. But I've computed the dip as 5.17%, which requires a planet of radius ~0.227 Rstar, which isn't an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the ratio of the flux from the spots to the flux from the rest of the star. Because when the spots are facing us, the flux is F_spotty, which is less than the flux when the other hemisphere is facing us, F_unspotty.

So the change in flux is F_unspotty - F_spotty.

But F_unspotty is just 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

F_spotty is (1.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 )

So the difference is:

Delta F = 2 pi R² sigma 6000^4 - [1.6 pi R² sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4 ]

= (2pi -1.6pi) R² sigma 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4

= 0.4 pi R² sigma 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R² sigma 5000^4

= 0.4 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Which, as before, gives (0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 )) / (4 *6000^4 ) *100% ≈5.17%.

So again, the same result.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the fact that when the star rotates, the spots appear and disappear, causing a periodic brightness variation, and the amplitude is the same as the dip from the planet.

So given that, the planet's radius would be ~0.227 Rstar, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot is on one hemisphere, so the effective area is half the star's surface. So perhaps the area of the spots is f * (pi R²), not f * (2 pi R²).

Wait, no. Because the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R², then the area of spots is f * 2 pi R².

Wait, maybe the filling factor is applied to the entire star. Let me see the problem statement again.

The problem states: "One hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere.

So when the star has one hemisphere with 20% spots, the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R².

So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spotty = (unspotted area + spotted area) as before.

But perhaps the problem is that the star's rotation causes the spots to come into view only part of the time, leading to an average flux that's lower than F0. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots is larger because they cause a deeper dip when they're in view.

Wait, perhaps the actual dip is (F_unspotty - F_spotty ) / F0, which is approximately 5.17%, as before.

So the only way the options make sense is if the dip is approx 5.17%, leading to a planet radius of about 0.227 Rstar, which isn't an option.

But looking at the options, only option C is 0.11. Wait, 0.11^2 is 0.0121. That's a 1.21% dip. That's smaller than what we have.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for alternative approaches.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness per unit rotation. So when the star rotates, the spot comes into view and then goes out, causing a sinusoidal variation in brightness. The amplitude of this variation is the same as the planet's dip.

But perhaps the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spot is (delta F) = (area of spot / area of star) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the brightness variation caused by the spots is due to their temperature difference, and the area they cover. So the amplitude is the product of the spot's area and the temperature difference in terms of flux.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options and calculations.

Earlier, when I considered the dip as 10.35%, the planet's radius would be about 0.32, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 0.11.

But wait, 0.11^2 is 0.0121, which is a 1.2% dip, which is much smaller than the 5% dip I calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of (R_planet/R_star) as sqrt( (F0 - F_spotty)/F0 ) / (F0 - F_spotty)/F0.

Wait, but no. The dip is (F0 - F_spotty)/F0.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this differently. The dip caused by the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. The dip caused by the spots is (delta F)/F0=0.0517, so the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.0517)=0.227. But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but the planet's radius is to be expressed as a fraction of the star's radius, so maybe the options are in terms of Jupiter radii or something else. But the problem states Rpl/Rstar, so it's a fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the sum of the contributions from the spots on the rotating star, which might involve a different calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spot covers 20% of the star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Because if the spot covers 20% of the entire surface, then when the star rotates, the flux changes as the spot comes into and out of view.

Wait, but the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered in spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (2 pi R²) = 0.4 pi R².

But the star's total surface area is 4 pi R², so the spots are 10% of the total area.

Wait, but when the star is viewed, the spots on the hemisphere facing us contribute to the flux, but when the star rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us. So the flux alternates between F_unspotty and F_spotty.

So the amplitude is (F_unspotty - F_spotty) / F0 = 0.0517 → 5.17% dip.

So again, the planet's radius would be sqrt(0.0517)=0.227 Rstar.

But since none of the options are near 0.23, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the dip when the spot is fully in front of the star, but the average brightness variation as the star rotates. For example, when the star is rotating, the spots might cause a sinusoidal variation in the observed flux. The amplitude of this sinusoid would be the difference between F_unspotty and F_spotty over 2, perhaps.

Wait, the maximum flux is F_unspotty=0.5 F0, and the minimum flux is F_spotty=0.447 F0.

The average flux would be (0.5 F0 + 0.447 F0 ) /2 = 0.4735 F0.

The peak-to-peak variation is 0.5 F0 -0.447 F0 = 0.053 F0.

The amplitude (half of peak-to-peak) is 0.0265 F0.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is ~2.65% of F0.

So to find the planet's radius that would cause the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.0265 → Rp/Rstar≈sqrt(0.0265)=0.1628.

Still not matching any option.

But perhaps the problem is considering the entire variation as a sinusoidal function with an amplitude of 5.17% (peak-to-peak), so the planet's dip would be 5.17%, leading to Rp/Rstar=0.227.

But again, no matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average change in brightness over time due to the spots, which is (F_unspotty + F_spotty)/2 - F0.

Wait, no. F0 is the flux without any spots. The star's average flux when spots are present would be the same as F0 if the star's Teff is given as 6000 K. So perhaps the problem is only considering the variation in brightness, not the average.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula for the brightness variation due to a spot as:

delta F/F0 = (A_spot / A_star) * (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 ) / T_star^4.

But let's see:

A_spot = 0.4 pi R^2.

A_star =4 pi R^2.

So A_spot/A_star=0.4 pi R^2 /4 pi R^2=0.1.

So (T_spot^4 - T_star^4 )= (5000^4 -6000^4 )= negative. So delta F/F0 = 0.1 * ( (5000/6000)^4 -1 )=0.1 * (0.4823-1)=0.1*(-0.5177)= -0.05177.

Which is a 5.177% decrease.

So the dip is 5.177%, so (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.05177 → Rp=0.227 Rstar.

Again, same result.

But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 0.11. Because 0.11^2=0.0121, which is a 1.2% dip. But why would the problem expect that?

Alternatively, perhaps I have made a mistake in the calculation of the flux.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are on one hemisphere, so when they're facing us, only 50% of the spots are visible. So perhaps the maximum area blocked is (0.2 * 2 pi R² ) * 0.5 =0.2 pi R².

Wait, that would change the calculation.

Wait, wait, no. When the hemisphere is facing us, the entire 0.2 * 2 pi R² area is visible. So the maximum area is 0.4 pi R².

But if I mistakenly thought that only 50% of the spots are visible, leading to 0.2 pi R², that would change the calculations.

Let me try that.

So if the area is 0.2 pi R², then:

delta F = [ (F_unspotty - F_spotty ) ].

F_unspotty =2 pi R² sigma (6000^4 )

F_spotty = (2 pi R² - 0.2 pi R² ) sigma (6000^4 ) + 0.2 pi R² sigma (5000^4 )

= 1.8 pi R² sigma (6000^4 ) + 0.2 pi R² sigma (5000^4 )

So delta F = (2 pi R² sigma 6000^4 ) - [1.8 pi R² sigma 6000^4 + 0.2 pi R² sigma5000^4 ]

= (2 pi -1.8 pi ) R² sigma 6000^4 - 0.2 pi R² sigma5000^4.

=0.2 pi R² sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Then, delta F / F0 = [0.2 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / (4 *6000^4 ) → 0.2 * (671) / (5184 )= 0.2 *0.1298 ≈0.02596 → 2.596% dip.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.02596 → Rp/Rstar≈0.161.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the star's spots are on the surface such that when they're facing us, the flux is F_spotty, and when they're not, it's F0. But that would be a different scenario.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer intended is option C) ~0.11, but I'm not confident.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20% (\( f = 0.2 \)).
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( \Delta T = 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation**:
   - The star's total surface area is \( 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), and the spotted hemisphere has an area of \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \). The spots cover 20% of this hemisphere, so the spot area is \( A_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - When the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots. The total flux is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = (0.8 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4).
     \]
   - When the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotty}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4.
     \]
   - The dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}.
     \]

3. **Fractional Brightness Variation**:
   - The total flux without spots is \( F_0 = 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - The fractional dip in brightness is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{F_{\text{unspotty}} - F_{\text{spotty}}}{F_0}.
     \]
   - Substituting the fluxes:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{(2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) - [(1.6\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4) + (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4)]}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]
   - Canceling terms:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 (T_{\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\text{spot}}^4)}{4 T_{\text{eff}}^4}.
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 [(6000^4 - 5000^4)]}{4 \times 6000^4}.
     \]
   - Compute \( 6000^4 = 1.296 \times 10^{15} \) and \( 5000^4 = 0.625 \times 10^{15} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 (1.296 \times 10^{15} - 0.625 \times 10^{15})}{4 \times 1.296 \times 10^{15}}.
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_0} = \frac{0.4 \times 0.671 \times 10^{15}}{5.184 \times 10^{15}} \approx 0.05177 \, \text{or} \, 5.177\%.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The dip in brightness caused by an exoplanet is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_0}.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta F}{F_0}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2276.
     \]
