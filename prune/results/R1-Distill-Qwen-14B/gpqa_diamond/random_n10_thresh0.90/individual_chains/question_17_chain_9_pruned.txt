Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember something about complexes and dissociation constants.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which is a chelating agent. So Ca-EDTA forms a complex ion, right? And the problem gives the formation constant, KCa-EDTA, as 5x10^10. Wait, no, wait, I think formation constants can sometimes be given as Kf or sometimes as Kstab, the stability constant. Oh yeah, the formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). But I'm a bit confused because sometimes it's written as [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]).

Wait, the question says KCa-EDTA is 5x10^10. So probably that's the stability constant, Kf. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

The question asks for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So we have to find [Ca^2+].

The solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me think. Since the complex is completely dissociated? Or wait, no, because EDTA forms a complex with Ca^2+ in solution. I think in solution, the Ca-EDTA complex dissociates to some extent.

Wait, the complex is in solution, so the initial concentration is 0.02 M. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But wait, if the complex dissociates, then:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

The equilibrium expression is Kf = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 5e10.

But wait, I think I need to set up the variables correctly. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ that dissociates. So, when the complex dissociates, the concentration of Ca^2+ would be x, and EDTA^4- would also be x, assuming that the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are negligible compared to the complex.

Wait, that might not always be the case, but since the Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning that it doesn't dissociate much. So the approximation that x is very small compared to 0.02 M might hold.

So, plugging into the Kf equation:

Kf = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02.

Because x is much smaller than 0.02, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x² = Kf * 0.02.

Wait, no, wait: Kf = x²/(0.02). So x² = Kf * 0.02 * (0.02 -x) ≈ Kf *0.02.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Wait, no, Kf equation is [Ca][EDTA]/[CaEDTA] = Kf.

Wait, so if [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, then the [Ca] and [EDTA] are both x, so (x)(x) / (0.02) = Kf.

So x² = Kf * 0.02.

Wait, Kf is 5e10, so x² = 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that again. 5e10 multiplied by 0.02 is 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. So x squared is 1e9, so x is the square root of 1e9, which is 3.16e4? Wait, that can't be right because 0.02 M is a low concentration, and that would imply that x is about 3e4 M, which is way higher than the initial concentration.

Wait, that can't be possible. That suggests that my assumption that x is much smaller than 0.02 is incorrect. So I must have made a wrong approach.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the complex is 0.02 M, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Then, when it dissociates, the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- would each be x. So the expression is Kf = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

But if Kf is so large, then the denominator (0.02 - x) must be approximately zero, because x would be almost equal to 0.02. So, if Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, that implies that the reaction almost goes to completion, meaning that the complex dissociates almost completely. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because Kf being large implies that the complex is very stable, meaning that it doesn't dissociate much. So perhaps I've got this backwards.

Wait a second. Maybe I got the Kf the wrong way. Wait, Kf is the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

And Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-}).

In this problem, we have the complex in solution, so the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-.

But when the complex dissociates, some of it breaks down into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x,

[Ca^2+] = x,

[EDTA^4-] = x.

So the Kf expression is:

Kf = (x * x) / (0.02 - x) = 5e10.

Now, if Kf is very large, the denominator must be very small, so (0.02 - x) is small, meaning x is very close to 0.02. Wait, but if x is close to 0.02, then 0.02 - x
