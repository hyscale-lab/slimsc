Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because b is a constant. So both stars have the same temperature.

Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving away or towards us. But when we're talking about luminosity, does the radial velocity matter? Hmm. Oh wait, no, because luminosity is intrinsic brightness, which depends on the star's properties, not on how it's moving relative to us. So maybe the radial velocity part is a red herring, or perhaps it affects the observed flux but not the calculated luminosity. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity based on their properties as black bodies. Oh, right. So the luminosity calculation would depend on radius, temperature and other factors. But wait, the question says they computed the luminosity, and they found Star_1's luminosity to be greater than Star_2's by a certain factor. So the problem is about calculating that factor.

So let's recap: the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So since the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same, the temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

So the luminosity ratio would be (L1)/(L2) = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (R1/R2)² (T1/T2)⁴.

But since T1 = T2, the (T1/T2)^4 term is 1. So the ratio is just (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

Then, (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the ratio is 2.25.

Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25 and D is ~2.23. Wait, that's close. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, did I miss any other factors? Because the problem also mentions the radial velocities. The velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. Oh, but when we observe the star's spectrum
