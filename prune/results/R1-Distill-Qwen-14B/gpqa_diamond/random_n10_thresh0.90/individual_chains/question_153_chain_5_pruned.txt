Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives three separate reactions, A, B, and C, and asks what the major products are. Then, they've given four options, each with different products for A, B, and C. I'll need to figure out each reaction step by step.

Starting with Reaction A: It's the Michael addition of dimethyl malonate with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on a beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. It acts as the enolate nucleophile. The other component is the alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor. So in the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at the 3-position. Wait, maybe it's more like CH2-C(=O)-OCH3 attached to a p-tolyl group? No, wait. The structure I think is CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl) with the ester group. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-CO-OCH3. Because the (E)-configuration would have the substituents on opposite sides, but perhaps that's not crucial for the product structure.

So when the enolate attacks, the attack would be at the beta position of the acrylate. So the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) has a negative charge on the alpha carbon. It attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C-O-R (where R is p-tolyl). So when the enolate attacks, it would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha of the enolate and the beta of the acrylate.

Wait, the enolate is a conjugate base. So the enolate is a strong nucleophile. So dimethyl malonate is a
