Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with similar structures but varying in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.

First, the data given includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me go through each of these one by one and see what information I can extract.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretches. The broadness suggests it's an -OH group, maybe in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it were a carboxylic acid, the peak would be even broader and possibly around 2500-3300. Also, the presence of a broad peak at 3000 might indicate an alcohol or possibly a ketone if it's a C-H stretch, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the C-H stretch for alcohols is usually around 3300-3500 and broad because of hydrogen bonding. So that peak at 3000 is probably an O-H stretch, likely from an alcohol.

Then, there are two other strong peaks: 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is a classic for carbonyl groups. Maybe a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it were a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but the broadness of the O-H in IR might suggest that. But the other peak is at 1650. That’s a bit tricky. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some conjugation, like in an ester or amide, but amides aren't in the options here. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like in a ketone with some double bonds nearby or perhaps an ester. Wait, another possibility is that 1650 could be an C=O stretch, but lower than 1700. Hmm, maybe it's an ester. Wait, esters usually have two carbonyl peaks because of the C=O and possibly a C-O stretch, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like a C=C. Oh, but in IR, the C=C stretch is around 1600-1680, so 1650 makes sense for that. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, so that suggests the presence of a double bond in the molecule. So, the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond. Now, looking at the options, which of them have both a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and a double bond?

The options are: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2.

So, let's think about possible functional groups. For example, an ester would have a carbonyl and an ether linkage (O connecting two carbons). An ester would have the formula R-O-CO-R', but let's see how that fits into the molecular formulas.

Alternatively, a ketone would have a carbonyl, and maybe an alcohol group since the O-H is present in IR. So maybe a ketone and an alcohol? But that would require two oxygen atoms, which would make the formula have O2. Let's see the options.

Wait, the options have either O, O2, or O. So, looking at the molecular formulas:

Option A: C6H12O2. So two oxygens. Could be an ester (which has two oxygens), or a ketone plus an alcohol, but that would mean two O-containing groups.

Option B: C6H10O. One oxygen. Maybe an alcohol with a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two oxygens. Could be an ester or something else.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen, probably an alcohol.

Now, considering the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what that could be. 45 is a common fragment, perhaps a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, it's the molecular ion of a fragment with a molecular weight of 45. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (32 is COOH, but wait, no, molecular weight of acetic acid is 60. Wait, 45... maybe a CH3COO- group? Wait, no, that's 60. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be the mass of a CH2OCH3 group or something else? Alternatively, maybe a ketene fragment, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH3CHO (which is 44), but wait, 45 is one more. Oh, wait, 45 is the same as the molecular weight of a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group. Wait, the molecular ion at 45 would be C3H7O, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, it's the loss of something. Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecular formula of the compound and see possible fragments.

Wait, the molecular formulas are:

A: C6H12O2 → Degree of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which can be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So the structure would have a carbonyl group and a double bond, plus an O in another group (like an ester). So maybe an ester with a double bond.

Wait, for C6H12O2:

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. But wait, that's only one degree. But if there's a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), that's two degrees. So D.O. Unsaturation would be 2. Let me check: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. Hmm, so that's only one degree of unsaturation. So that would mean either a carbonyl group (one double bond) and a ring, or two rings, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So maybe it's a ring plus a double bond. Wait, but D.O. for a ring is 1, and a double bond another, summing to 2. Wait, but (2*6+2 -12)=14-12=2 → 2/2=1. So only one degree. So that's a problem because if the compound has a carbonyl and a double bond, that's two degrees. So C6H12O2 can't have both. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is an ester, which would count as a double bond, and maybe a ring. But then the NMR would show a double bond, but if the ring isn't aromatic, maybe that's not the case. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. That could be a ring and one double bond, but for a six-carbon compound, maybe a ring and a carbonyl. But wait, if there's a carbonyl, that's a double bond, so a ring plus a carbonyl would account for two DoU. Hmm, but according to the calculation, it's only one. So perhaps the structure doesn't have both. So maybe it's a ring plus an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a gamma-lactone or something else. Not sure.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU is (2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. So that's possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But again, considering the NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so that's possible.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. Which could be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. But one DoU would imply either a double bond or a ring. So if it has a double bond, that's one DoU, which fits.

But wait, the IR has a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl, so that's a double bond. So in that case, the compound must have a carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So that accounts for one DoU. Then, if the compound has another DoU, perhaps a ring.

But let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. DoU=1. So if it has a carbonyl (one DoU), then no other double bonds or rings. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so another double bond. Wait, that's impossible because that would require two DoU, but the formula only allows one. So this can't be correct. So option A is probably not the answer.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. If it has a carbonyl (one DoU) and a double bond (another), that's two. So that could fit.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. Carbonyl (one) and double bond (another). So that's possible.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. Carbonyl is one DoU, so no other. But the NMR says vinyl hydrogens, so another double bond. Thus, not possible. So options A and D are out because they don't account for the double bond needed for the vinyl hydrogens.

So now, down to options B and C.

Looking back to the IR:

The peaks at 1700 and 1650. So, 1700 is a carbonyl. 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond. But in the case of a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, the carbonyl stretch would be around 1700, and the C=C would be around 1650. So that fits. So the molecule has an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester conjugated with a double bond.

So, for example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure could be something like CH2CHCO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Now, looking at the NMR: presence of vinyl hydrogens. So in an alpha,beta-unsaturated group, the vinyl protons would be on the double bond. So the NMR would show those as a doublet or something else, depending on the substitution.

Now, the mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about what that could be. 45 is a common mass for a fragment. For example, the methyl group attached to an oxygen, like in an ester. Or maybe a CH3CO- group. Wait, CH3CO is 45 (12+1+12+16=43?), no, wait, CH3CO is 43 (12*2 + 1*3 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43). Hmm, but 45 is 43 plus 2, so maybe CH3COOH would lose a proton? Or perhaps another possibility.

Alternatively, 45 could be a propene fragment (C3H6, which is 42?), but I don't think so. Wait, 45 is also the mass of a CH2CO (which is 44 if it's CH2COOH?), no, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl acetate group? Let me think. The molecular weight of methyl acetate is 86 (C3H6O2). If you break off the methyl group (15), the remaining would be 71, which isn't 45. Alternatively, maybe losing something else.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the compound. Let's think about each option and possible structures.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So perhaps a cyclopentene ring with an oxygen substituent, like a ketone. Wait, but that would require a carbonyl. So cyclopentenone? So like cyclopent-2-en-1-one. That would have a ring (cyclopentane) with a ketone and a double bond. That would fit the IR: O-H? Wait, no, cyclopentenone wouldn't have an -OH group. Wait, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. So unless there's an alcohol group as well.

So cyclopentenol would have an -OH group. But then the carbonyl would be a ketone, which would be around 1700. Then, the double bond would cause a peak around 1650. But the molecular formula of cyclopentenol would be C5H8O. But our options are C6H10O, which is one more carbon and two more hydrogens. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like methyl cyclopentenecarboxylate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene ring, but I don't know if that fits the molecular formula.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So perhaps an ester with a double bond. Let's say the structure is something like CH2CHCO-O-R. Wait, but let me think of a specific example. Maybe it's a gamma,delta-unsaturated ester. Wait, but that's just making up structures.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. But I'm not sure if that would account for the IR data. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Now, thinking about the mass spectrum: fragment at 45. So if the compound is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks off. For example, in an ester cleavage, the ester group might break into a methyl group and the rest. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecular formula for each option and see which could produce a fragment of 45.

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(16) =72+10+16=98. So the molecular ion would be at 98. If a fragment breaks off, say, a CH3 group (15), then the remaining would be 83. Not 45. Alternatively, breaking off a C3H6O group (58) would leave 40, which isn't 45.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114. So the molecular ion is at 114. If a fragment breaks off, say, a (CH3)2CO group (which is 58), the remaining would be 56. Not 45. Alternatively, if it's an ester, maybe it breaks into a methyl group (15) and the rest. 114-15=99. No.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be the mass of a (CH3)COO group. Let's see: CH3COO is C2H3O2. The molecular weight is (12*2)+(3
