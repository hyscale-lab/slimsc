Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through them logically.

Alright, the problem gives me three main pieces of data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to figure out the molecular formula from the options provided.

First, let's look at the FTIR. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretch, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The other strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a C=O stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe like a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substituents. Wait, but wait, some other possibilities: 1700 is a strong peak for esters, ketones, maybe aldehydes. 1650 could be something else, like conjugated double bonds or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents or maybe an amide? But I don't think so because the problem doesn't mention NMR peaks that would suggest amines or amides. So more likely, the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is maybe an aromatic C=C stretching or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl in a conjugated system, like an ester with conjugation or maybe a ketone with nearby double bonds.

Wait, but wait, what about the 1H NMR? It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond. So that suggests the compound has a double bond, probably in a conjugated system. Like perhaps in an ester or a ketone with a neighboring double bond. Or maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Those have both a carbonyl and a double bond adjacent to it, which would cause splitting in the NMR.

Moving on to the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that m/z 45 is indicative of certain ions. Let me think. The most common fragment would be for (CH3)2O, which is 45 (since 12*2 + 1*6 + 16 = 24 +6 +16=46? Wait, no, wait, (CH3)2O is (12 +3*1)*2 + 16 = (15)*2 +16=30+16=46. Hmm, that's 46, not 45. So maybe something else. Alternatively, a fragment of 45 could be (CH3)CO, but that's 44 (12+3*1 +12 +16= 12*2=24, 3*2=6, 16=16. 24+6+16=46 again... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait another possibility: the fragment could be (CH3)CO+ would be 45? Let's calculate: (CH3)CO+ would be C2H5O+? Wait, molecular formula C2H5O has a molecular weight of 2*12 +5*1 +16 =24 +5 +16=45. Oh, right! So m/z 45 could correspond to the ion (CH3)2O+? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is 46. So maybe the fragment is (CH3)CO, which is 45. Wait, but (CH3)CO would be C2H5O, which is 45. So perhaps that's a possibility.

Wait, but in the context of the compound, if the molecular formula is one of the options, let's list all the options and their molecular weights just in case.

Options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is 6*12 +12 +2*16 =72+12+32=116
B) C6H10O: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 16=16. Total 98
C) C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10, 32=114
D) C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100

So, the molecular weight of the compound would be one of these: 98, 100, 114, or 116.

But the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. So this fragment is part of the molecule. So the molecular formula must have a part that can break off as 45.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecular ion is at a higher m/z, but a fragment is at 45. So, for example, if the compound is an ester, like RCOOR', which would produce different fragments. Alternatively, maybe a ketone with an adjacent ester group.

But let me think about the IR data again. The broad peak at 3000 is probably O-H. The strong peak at 1700 is a carbonyl, so maybe an ester (which has two carbonyl groups?), wait no. Wait, an ester has one carbonyl group. Wait, so why is there a peak at 1650? Hmm. Maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups. Or perhaps one carbonyl and another type of group, like a conjugated double bond.

Wait, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic C=C. But the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond adjacent to the aromatic ring, perhaps, or an isolated double bond.

Wait, but the problem says "several peaks including peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens." So, the compound has a double bond, which is likely a conjugated system if the IR shows a peak at 1650. Because conjugated double bonds (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl) would have lower wavenumbers, around 1650 maybe. So perhaps the structure is something like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone.

Wait, then the IR at 1700 would correspond to the carbonyl, and 1650 the conjugated double bond. The O-H in the IR suggests the presence of a hydroxyl group, but wait, if it's an ester, there wouldn't be an O-H. Unless it's a carboxylic acid, but that would have a broad O-H peak, which is consistent with the FTIR data.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the broad peak could be an alcohol O-H. Then the structure would have both an alcohol group and a carbonyl group. But that would require the formula to have at least two oxygen atoms, because an alcohol has one O, and a carbonyl (like ketone or ester) another, but wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but then the formula would have two O's. Looking at the options, option A is C6H12O2, B is C6H10O (only one O), C is C6H10O2, D is C6H12O.

Wait, but in the IR, the 1700 is a carbonyl, which could be a ketone. Then the 1650 could be an adjacent double bond. But where would the O-H come from? If the compound is something like cyclohexanone with an alcohol group, but that would require at least two O's, which would fit either A or C.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So, the presence of a double bond. If it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, that would explain the conjugated double bond.

So, considering all this, the structure might be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone with an O-H group. But wait, where would the O-H come from? Alternatively, perhaps the O is from an ester group. Wait, but esters don't have O
