Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when light travels through a medium like glass, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But wait, the glass itself is moving, so does that affect the observed speed of light?

Let me read the problem again. A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the options are A to D.

I think I should start by recalling some basic concepts. The speed of light in a medium is generally given by v_medium = c / n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium itself is moving, so I need to consider the relative motion between the medium and the observer.

Wait, so when the medium is moving, does that affect the observed speed of light? I think this is related to the principle of relativity. Oh right, Einstein's theory of relativity. But wait, does that apply here? Or is this a case where the velocity of the medium adds to the velocity of light in some way?

In the case of classical mechanics, velocities add up simply, like v_observed = v_medium + v_source. But when it comes to light, things are different because of how relativity works. Light always travels at speed c in a vacuum, regardless of the source's motion. But here, the medium itself is moving, so I'm not sure if that's the same as the source moving.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving through the glass, so from the lab's perspective, how does that look?

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, we have to transform the velocities. So perhaps this is a problem of velocity addition in special relativity.

Wait, but wait, special relativity applies when dealing with velocities close to c, but in this problem, v is probably much smaller than c, so maybe we can use the classical approach for simplicity. Or does it matter?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to consider the velocity of the light as perceived by the lab. So in the lab's frame, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. Then, in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, so the light's velocity would be v_light' = v_light + v? But wait, no, that's the classical approach, but that can't be right because if v_light is c/n (which is less than c, since n>1), then adding v would make it possible that it exceeds c, which is not possible according to relativity.

Hmm, so that suggests that the classical addition doesn't apply here. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Right, the relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But in this case, the speed of light in the medium is not c, it's c/n. Wait, so let me think: in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is u = c/n. Then in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, what is u'?

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the glass's frame is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at v, and in the glass, the light is moving at c/n.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the reference frames. Let me clarify: the lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So in the glass's
