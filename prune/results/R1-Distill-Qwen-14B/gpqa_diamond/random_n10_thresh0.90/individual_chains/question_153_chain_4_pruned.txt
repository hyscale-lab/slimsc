Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each is a different Michael addition reaction, and I need to figure out the products. Then, looking at the options, I can match them to the correct products.

Starting with part A: Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So, NaOEt is a strong base, and in EtOH, which is a polar aprotic solvent, but wait, no, EtOH is a protic solvent. Oh, but in Michael addition, the base is used to deprotonate the alpha carbon of the nucleophile.

Wait, Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate, which is generated from a carbonyl compound. In this case, the nucleophile is from dimethyl malonate, I think.

So dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it would form the enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon, which can attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure must be something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituents in the E configuration. Wait, wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the 3-position. Oh wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the second carbon? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the central carbon. No, wait: if it's 3-substituted, then the structure would be CH2-C(OCH3)=CH-p-tolyl? No, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl at the gamma position? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the structure is CH2=CH-p-tolyl group attached to the carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but where the CH2=CH- is attached to the carbonyl. Wait, that's not right. Wait, the correct structure for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate should be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the acrylate's middle carbon. Wait, maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but
