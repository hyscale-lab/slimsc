Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, with various exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting plx with 1/d, since plx = 1/d, that would make 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me write that out: 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, wait. Because if N is proportional to d^5, that would mean as distance increases, the number of stars increases a lot. But wait, that doesn't make intuitive sense. Because when you look farther away, each additional unit of distance should have more stars, but I'm not sure if it's d^5 or something else.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so it's about the number density as a function of distance. So maybe I'm looking at the differential number of stars, like how many stars are there between r and r+dr, so the number per unit distance.

Wait, I think I should approach this more carefully. Let's model it mathematically.

Let me denote N as the number of stars. The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So substituting, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So the number of stars increases as d^5. But that's not the rate of change; that's the total number. Hmm, but the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the number of stars per unit volume or per unit shell. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr.

Wait, in 3D space, a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr has a volume of 4πr² dr. So if the number of stars in such a shell is proportional to r² dr multiplied by some function of r. But in this problem, the number of stars is varying with parallax as 1/plx^5, which we've determined is d^5.

Wait, so maybe the number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d^5. But the thickness of the shell is dr, so the number per unit distance (dr) would be N_shell = k * d^5 * dr, where k is some constant. So the number per unit dr is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but that would mean that the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^5, which would mean that as you go farther, each additional unit of distance contains more stars. But that seems counterintuitive because when you look farther away, the density should be lower, not higher. Unless the star density is increasing with distance, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me go back. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, that would mean that as d increases, the number of stars N increases as d^5. That suggests that there are more stars at larger distances, which doesn't make sense in the real universe because the star density typically decreases with distance from the galaxy's center. But maybe this is a different scenario.

But regardless of the real-world case, let's go by the given relation. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps the correct way to model this is to think about the differential number of stars as a function of d.

Wait, if N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d (with thickness dr) would be dN = N(d + dr) - N(d) ≈ (d^5 - (d + dr)^5 ) ? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps better to think of it as a density function. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit volume (or per unit distance in this case, if the region is cylindrical or something else).

Wait, maybe I should think of N as the number of stars per unit volume. So if the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, and since volume is proportional to r^3 (in a spherical sense), perhaps I'm mixing concepts. Or perhaps the problem is considering a different geometry.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a region of the sky is being considered as a function of distance. So for a given solid angle (since it's a region of the sky), the number of stars would depend on the depth in that direction. So the number of stars at a certain distance d would be proportional to d^5, but how does that translate into the number per unit distance?

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises between the total number and the number per unit distance. Let me think again. If N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dr would be N_shell ≈ N(d + dr) - N(d) = [k (d+dr)^5] - [k d^5] = k [ (d^5 + 5d^4 dr + ... ) - d^5 ] ≈ 5 k d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) is 5 k d^4. So the number increases with d^4 per unit distance.

Wait, but the problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which is d^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to d^5. So if you're looking at the number of stars in a given volume (like a shell), then that volume is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in the shell is N_shell = (number density) × volume. The number density here is N ∝ d^5, but that doesn't seem right because number density should be per unit volume. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to express number of stars in a region as a function of distance. If the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But the question is about how the number changes with distance — per unit range.

So if N ∝ d^5, then the derivative dN/dd = 5 d^4. So the rate of change (how many more stars per unit distance) is proportional to d^4. But the question is not about the derivative; it's about how N changes with distance, which is the function itself, which is d^5. But wait, the options don't have d^5 as an answer. The options are A: r^3, B: r^5, C: r^4, D: r^2.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm supposed to model the number of stars per unit volume as a function of distance. Let me think again.

Wait, if the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to d^5, then that's the number density. But the number of stars in a thin shell (at distance d, thickness dr) would be number density × volume of the shell. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π r² dr. So the number in the shell would be (k d^5) * 4π r² dr. So N_shell = 4 π k d^7 dr.

But that doesn't seem to directly answer the question, which is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not accounting for the volume of the shell, and is looking for how the number of stars varies along the line of sight. So in that case, perhaps the number of stars at a distance d is proportional to d^5. So if you're looking at a particular direction, the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec) might be proportional to d^5. But wait, that would suggest that as d increases, you find more stars per parsec, which seems contradictory because the galaxy's density decreases with distance, but perhaps in this problem's scenario, the density increases.

But the question is probably looking for the functional form. The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So the number of stars increases as d^5. So the number of stars in a region (per unit distance) would be proportional to d^5. But wait, if the number is N ∝ d^5, then the number per unit distance is increasing with d^5. However, that's not one of the options. Wait, the options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2.

Wait, but the options use r instead of d, but I think that's just a substitution. So option B is r^5, which is what we have. But wait, let me think again. The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5 = d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars per unit distance (per parsec, say) would be increasing as d^5.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the differential number of stars per unit distance, which would involve the derivative. Wait, but the question says how the number of stars in that region of the sky changes with distance per unit range. So maybe it's the derivative of N with respect to d.

Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd = 5 d^4. So the derivative is proportional to d^4, which would mean that the number of stars increases by a factor proportional to d^4 per unit distance. So the rate of change is d^4, which would correspond to option C, which is r^4.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's the derivative, meaning the rate of change is proportional to d^4, so option C.

But earlier, I thought N is proportional to d^5 because plx = 1/d. So N = k/(plx)^5 = k d^5. So the number of stars in the region increases as d^5. But the question is how the number changes with distance — per unit range. So maybe it's the derivative, which is 5k d^4. So the change per unit distance is proportional to d^4, so option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again. The options are about how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range). So if the number of stars is proportional to d^5, then the change in number with d is proportional to d^5. But that's the function itself, not the derivative. Wait, but the question is about how it changes, so perhaps it's the rate of change, which is the derivative.

Alternatively, maybe the question is just asking how N scales with d, which is d^5, so option B.

Wait, but what's the correct way to model this? Let me think again.

If the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So for each additional distance d, the number of stars goes up by d^5. So the number of stars increases as d^5, which would mean that as you go farther, the number of stars you encounter increases a lot. So if you're looking at how N changes with d, it's proportional to d^5. So option B is r^5, which would be the answer.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars in that region changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps they're looking for dN/dr, the rate of change. So dN/dr = 5 d^4. So that would be option C, r^4.

Wait, this is where I'm getting confused. The question is a bit ambiguous. It says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So per unit range, perhaps it's the derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the number of stars is N ∝ 1/plx^5, so N ∝ d^5. So for a given region, the number of stars increases as d^5. So per unit distance, that would be a change in N proportional to d^5 per unit d. But that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, it's the number per unit volume, but that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the number of stars as a function of distance, which is N ∝ d^5. So if you are looking at the number of stars in a region of the sky, the number increases as you go to larger distances. So for each additional distance r, the number increases as r^5. So the number of stars in that region is proportional to r^5, so the correct option is B.

But wait, in reality, the number of stars in a given volume decreases with distance because the density of stars decreases, but this is a hypothetical scenario where the number varies as 1/plx^5. So in this scenario, the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

So putting it all together, I think the answer is B) ~ r^5.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relation, we find \( N \propto d^5 \), meaning the number of stars increases as the fifth power of the distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance "per unit range of distance, \( r \)." This suggests the rate of change of the number of stars with respect to distance, which is the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto d^5 \), we get \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto d^4 \). Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

However, the question could also be interpreted as asking how the total number of stars scales with distance, in which case \( N \propto d^5 \), corresponding to \( r^5 \). Given the phrasing of the question and the options provided, the most likely interpretation is that the total number of stars in the region scales as \( r^5 \).

ANSWER: B
