Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices. Let me think about what I know.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, but the angles can be different. Oh, wait, no, no, the question says α=β=γ=30 degrees. So that's a special case—maybe a primitive rhombohedral lattice or something else?

Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between atoms along the edge of the unit cell. So the lattice parameter 'a' would be 10 Angstroms, correct? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is equal to the lattice constant. But I'm not sure if it's a simple structure or not.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by the formula 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - something involving the angles. Oh wait, no, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is a bit more complicated.

Right, the formula is d_{hkl} = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + terms involving the angles ) ]^(-1/2). Wait, no, I'm getting confused. I think the correct formula involves the reciprocal of the product of (hkl) with the metric tensor, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, I think the general formula for the interplanar distance is derived from the reciprocal space. Let me recall. The formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / a² * ... ). Oh wait, perhaps I should use the formula involving the dot product of the plane vectors.

Wait, the Miller indices (hkl) define a plane. The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the metric tensor components multiplied by h², k², l², and cross terms.

I think the general formula is 1/d² = (h²/a² + k²/b² + l²/c²) + (2hk cos γ)/(a b) + ... no, that's not exactly it. Wait, no. I think the correct formula is more like:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... but considering the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula for a cubic system first. Because in a cubic system, the formula simplifies. But in this case, the crystal is rhombohedral, which is a type of hexagonal system? No, wait, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system where the angles are not 90 degrees. So it's a distorted cubic system.

Wait, no, no. The rhombohedral system is one of the seven crystal systems. It's a type of hexagonal system, or perhaps a type of trigonal system. Wait, no, let me clarify.

The seven crystal systems are cubic, hexagonal, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and rhombohedral. Rhombohedral is a special case of the orthorhombic system where all three lattice parameters are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are 90 degrees? Or wait, no. Wait, no, in the rhombohedral system, the three lattice parameters are equal, and the angles are either all 90 degrees (which would make it cubic) or all the same but not 90 degrees (so a rhombohedral system is a special case with a=b=c and α=β=γ).

Wait, so if a = b = c and angles are all equal but not 90 degrees, it's rhombohedral. So in this problem, the crystal is rhombohedral with a=10 Angstroms (since the interatomic distance is 10, which I think is 'a' in this case), and each angle is 30 degrees.

So, now, the formula for the interplanar distance is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos γ)/(a²) - (2 hk cos β')/(a²) - etc. Wait, that's getting confusing.

Alternatively, I think for a rhombohedral system, the formula can be simplified. Let me look up the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal.

Wait, I recall that for a rhombohedral system, the formula uses the angle between the lattice vectors. So, the formula for d_{hkl} is:

d_{hkl} = [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ]^(-1/2) * a / sqrt( (sin θ)^2 * (h² + k² + l²) - 2 sin θ (hk + hl + kl) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right. Let me think differently. The general formula for interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) ) * ... something involving cosines of angles. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps using the reciprocal space approach. The metric tensor in reciprocal space is the inverse of the metric tensor in real space. The metric tensor for a rhombohedral crystal is:

G = a² [ 1, cos γ, cos γ;
          cos γ, 1, cos γ;
          cos γ, cos γ, 1 ]

Wait, but wait, because in a rhombohedral system, all angles α, β, γ are equal. So in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, so cos γ = cos 30° = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. No, wait, in a rhombohedral, the angles between the lattice vectors are all equal. So, the angle between a and b is α, between b and c is β, and between a and c is γ. But in a rhombohedral system, these are all equal because a=b=c. So, α = β = γ = 30 degrees in this problem.

So, the metric tensor in real space is:

g_11 = a²
g_22 = a²
g_33 = a²
g_12 = g_13 = g_23 = a² cos θ, where θ is 30 degrees.

So, the metric tensor G is a 3x3 matrix where the diagonal elements are a², and the off-diagonal elements are a² cos θ.

In reciprocal space, the metric tensor G* is the inverse of G. But to find d_{hkl}, we can use the formula:

d_{hkl}^2 = 1 / [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ]

Wait, let me think again. The reciprocal of d squared is equal to (h² +k² +l²) times the inverse of a squared, but adjusted for the angles.

Alternatively, I've heard that the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles α = β = γ can be calculated by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α )

Wait, that sounds familiar. Because in the cubic system, when α=90 degrees, cos α is zero, and the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which is correct.

So in our case, since α=30 degrees, cos α is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So let's plug in h=1, k=1, l=1.

So, the denominator becomes:

sqrt( 1² + 1² + 1² - 2*(1*1)*cos 30° - 2*(1*1)*cos 30° - 2*(1*1)*cos 30° )

Wait, wait, no, the formula is (h² + k² + l²) minus 2hk cos α minus 2hl cos α minus 2kl cos alpha.

So,

h² + k² + l² = 3.

2hk cos 30 = 2 *1*1 * 0.8660 = 1.732.

But wait, each term is 2hk cos θ, 2hl cos θ, 2kl cos θ. So summing those gives 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos θ.

So,

h² +k² +l² - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cos θ.

So, plugging in h=k=l=1,

3 - 2*(3) * (0.8660)

Because hk + hl + kl = 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 =3.

So,

3 - 2*3*(0.8660) = 3 - 6*(0.8660) = 3 - 5.196 ≈ -2.196.

Wait, but that would make the denominator sqrt of a negative number, which is impossible. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the
