Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids depending on the coefficients.

So the question is about the area of a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like a tractricoid, which is the classic example. But wait, in general relativity, a pseudosphere might be part of a spacetime, but here we're probably talking about a spatial surface.

Wait, the metric given is in two dimensions, since it's dx² + dy², so it's a 2D space. So maybe it's a 2D surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

I think about the line element for a sphere. The standard metric for a sphere of radius a in 3D is ds² = a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²), but that's in spherical coordinates. Alternatively, sometimes people use a flat space metric scaled by a function, like ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), but in this question, the metric is in terms of x and y, not r and θ.

Wait, the given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So it's a conformally flat metric because the coefficients for dx² and dy² are the same. That suggests it's a 2D surface with a conformal factor.

Wait, conformal factors are related to the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K of a 2D surface with metric ds² = E(dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2E)) * Laplacian of ln(E), but maybe that's more complicated than I need right now.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the metric in terms of isometric embedding. For a pseudosphere, which has constant negative curvature, its metric can be expressed in a way that's similar to hyperbolic space.

Wait, hyperbolic space in 2D can be represented with different coordinate systems. One common form is the Poincaré disk model, where the metric is ds² = (4/(1 - x² - y²²)) (dx² + dy²). Wait, but that's for a hyperbolic plane with curvature. Let me think: the Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 dr² + 4r²/(1 - r²)^2 dθ², where r is the radial coordinate. But in terms of x and y, maybe it's similar to the given metric.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the line element is 4/(1 - x² - y²)^2 (dx² + dy²), right? Because r² = x² + y², so the factor is 4/(1 - r²)^2. But in the given metric, it's 32/(4 - x² - y²). Hmm, that's different. Let me see: 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - r²/4), where r² = x² + y². So the denominator is 4(1 - (r²)/4).

So the given metric is [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²) = (32)/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, that looks similar to the Poincaré disk metric but scaled. Let me compare.

Poincaré disk: ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²) which in Cartesian coordinates would be (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2)(dx² + dy²).

So our given metric is 8/(1 - (r²)/4) times (dx² + dy²), since x² + y² = r².

Wait, 8/(1 - (r²)/4) can be written as 8 * [1/(1 - (r²/4))] = 8 * [1/(1 - (r²)/(2^2))] = 8 * [1/(1 - (r/(2))²)].

Wait, the Poincaré disk model for a hyperbolic plane of curvature K is often written with a scaling factor. The Gaussian curvature K is related to the coefficient. For the standard Poincaré disk with radius a, the curvature is K = -1/a². So if our given metric is scaled differently, perhaps the radius is different.

Wait, in the given metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²)/(4)).

So the metric is (32)/(4(1 - r²/4)) (dx² + dy²) = (8)/(1 - r²/4) (dx² + dy²).

Comparing this to the standard Poincaré disk metric (4)/(1 - r²)^2 (dx² + dy²), so the given metric has 8/(1 - r²/4) instead of 4/(1 - r²)^2. Hmm, I'm trying to see if these can be made to look the same by changing variables.

Let me think about scaling the coordinates. Let me set r' = r/2, so that r = 2 r'. Then r² = 4 r'².

Substituting into the given metric: 8/(1 - (4 r'²)/4) ) (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - r'²) (dx² + dy²). Now, in terms of r', the metric is 8/(1 - r'²) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2) because dx² + dy² = dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2.

Wait, the Poincaré disk metric is 4/(1 - r'^2)^2 (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2). Our given metric after substitution is 8/(1 - r'^2) (dr'^2 + r'^2 dθ^2).

So if I factor out 8/(1 - r'^2), that's different from the standard Poincaré metric which has (1 - r'^2)^2 in the denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a hyperbolic space with a different curvature. Let me recall that the Gaussian curvature K for the Poincaré disk is K = -1/(a^2), where a is the radius of the disk. But in our case, the metric is scaled differently.

Wait, another approach: The area of a pseudosphere (assuming it's a 2D surface) would be computed by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in the given metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is conformally flat, the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) times (dx dy). Wait, no, the metric is diagonal, so the determinant is just the product of the coefficients. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ?? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, the metric is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy². In our case, the cross terms are zero, so g_{xy}=0. So the determinant is g_{xx} * g_{yy} - (g_{xy})² = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 -x² -y²)^2.

Wait, no, wait. The given metric is written as (32/denominator) (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor is diag( A, A ), where A = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is A^2, since it's diagonal with both terms A. So the area element is sqrt(A^2) dx dy, which is A dx dy. So the area element dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, no. Wait, the area element in 2D for a metric ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy² is sqrt(EG - F²) dx dy. In our case, E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and F=0. So sqrt(EG) = sqrt( (32/(4 -...))^2 ) = 32/(4 - ...). So dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

So the area would be the double integral over the region where 4 - x² - y² >0, because the metric is real. So x² + y² <4, which is the interior of a circle of radius 2.

So the area is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, that's a standard integral. Let's switch to polar coordinates, since x² + y² = r². Then dx dy = r dr dθ. The integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the area A = ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

First, compute the radial integral: ∫0^2 (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr. So r dr = - du/2.

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫_{u=4}^{u=0} (32)(-du/2)/(u) ) = ∫ from 4 to 0 of (32)(-1/2) du/(u) ) = (32/2 ) ∫ from 0 to 4 (du/u) ) because flipping the limits removes the negative sign.

Wait, 32/2 is 16. So 16 ∫0^4 (1/u) du.

The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, so evaluated from 0 to 4. But wait, the integral from 0 to 4 of 1/u du is divergent because ln(0) is negative infinity. So this integral diverges, which would mean that the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, original integral: ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me factor out the substitution again. Let u =4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → r dr = - du/2.

So the integral becomes (32) ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = (32) ∫ ( (-du/2) ) / u.

The limits of u when r=0 → u=4, when r=2 → u=0.

So ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (32) * (-du/2) / u = ∫ from 4 to 0 ( -16 du / u ). Flipping the integral limits: ∫ from 0 to4 (16 du/u) ) → 16 [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

As u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches negative infinity. So the upper limit at u=4 is ln(4), and lower limit is ln(0+) which is -infty. So the integral is 16 [ ln(4) - (-infty) ) ] → 16 (infinite) → which is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. How can the area be infinite? Hmm, perhaps because the metric is that of a hyperbolic space, which is non-compact. Wait, the pseudosphere is a compact surface, like a sphere, so its area should be finite. Or am I getting something wrong?

Wait, wait, the pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, has finite area. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, but the given metric's denominator is 4 - x² - y². So x² + y² must be less than 4. So the domain is the disk of radius 2. But the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy. Integrating this over the disk would give an infinite area? But a pseudosphere should have finite area.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the metric. Maybe the given metric is not representing a pseudosphere but something else. Or perhaps it's a different kind of surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere in this context refers to a 2D surface with constant negative curvature, which has infinite area. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. No, the tractricoid (a pseudosphere) is a surface of constant negative curvature, but it's a finite area surface because it's a compact surface. Or is it?

Wait, no. The tractricoid is a surface of infinite extent. Oh wait, no, the tractricoid is a surface of revolution of the tractrix, which is a curve of finite length. But when you spin it around, it forms a surface of infinite area? Or is it finite?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The tractrix is a curve that approaches an asymptote. The tractricoid, when you rotate it, creates a surface that looks like a horn, but it's a finite surface with finite area and finite volume (if embedded in 3D). So the area should be finite.

If that's the case, then perhaps the given metric has finite area, which would mean my previous calculation of area being infinite is incorrect. So I must have messed up the substitution or the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not for a pseudosphere but for a different surface. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the given metric isn't for a hyperbolic space but for a sphere. Let me see. Let me compare it to the standard metric for a sphere.

The standard metric in 2D for a sphere of radius a is ds² = a² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²). But in Cartesian coordinates, a metric for a sphere can be written as ds² = (R²/(x² + y²)) (dx² + dy²), but that's only in certain conformal maps. Wait, no, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: The Gaussian curvature K of the metric can be found, and if it's constant and negative, it's a pseudosphere.

The formula for Gaussian curvature in 2D for a conformal metric (ds² = E(dx² + dy²)) is K = - (1/(2E)) * Laplacian of ln(E). Let's compute that.

Here, E = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So ln(E) = ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²).

The Laplacian of ln(E) is the sum of second derivatives:

∇² ln(E) = (d²/dx² ln(E)) + (d²/dy² ln(E)).

Compute d²/dx² ln(E):

d/dx ln(E) = d/dx [ ln(32) - ln(4 - x² - y²) ) ] = (0) - [ (-2x)/(4 - x² - y²) ) ] = (2x)/(4 - x² - y²).

Then the second derivative:

d²/dx² [ (2x)/(4 - x² - y²) ) ] = [2(4 - x² - y²) - 2x*(-2x) ] / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, let me compute it correctly.

Let me denote D = 4 - x² - y².

So f(x,y) = 2x / D.

df/dx = [2 D - 2x (-2x) ] / D² = [2D +4x²]/ D².

Wait, no, more accurately:

df/dx = [ (2) * D - (2x)(dD/dx) ) ] / D².

dD/dx = -2x.

So df/dx = [ 2 D - (2x)(-2x) ) ] / D² = [2 D +4x²]/ D².

Then d²f/dx² = [ (2 D +4x²) * D² - (2 D +4x²) * 2 D (-2x) ) ] / D^4.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for a function f(r) where r² = x² + y², the Laplacian in 2D is (1/r) d/dr (r df/dr) ) in polar coordinates. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute ∇² ln(E) in Cartesian coordinates.

Wait, ln(E) = ln(32) - ln(D) = C - ln(D), where C is a constant. The Laplacian of a constant is zero. So ∇² ln(E) = ∇² (-ln(D)) = - ∇² ln(D).

So compute ∇² ln(D).

D = 4 - r², where r² = x² + y².

In polar coordinates, ln(D) = ln(4 - r²).

The Laplacian in polar coordinates is (1/r) d/dr (r d(ln D)/dr) ).

d(ln D)/dr = (1/(4 - r²)) * (-2r) ) = (-2r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r * (-2r)/(4 - r²) = (-2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Then take derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (-4r)(4 - r²) + (2 r^3) ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let's compute numerator:

-4r (4 - r²) = -16 r + 4 r^3.

Adding 2 r^3: total numerator is (-16 r +4 r^3 + 2 r^3) = -16 r +6 r^3.

So the derivative is (6r^3 -16 r) / (4 - r^2)^2.

So the Laplacian of ln(D) is (1/r) * [ (6 r^3 -16 r) / (4 - r^2)^2 ) ] = (6r^2 -16) / [ r (4 - r^2)^2 ) ].

Wait, but I'm not sure if I'm doing this correctly. Let me check again.

Wait, ∇² ln(D) in 2D polar coordinates:

∇² f = (1/r) d/dr ( r df/dr ).

So f = ln(D) = ln(4 - r²).

df/dr = (1/(4 - r²)) * (-2 r) )= (-2 r)/(4 - r²).

Multiply by r: r * (-2 r)/(4 - r²) )= (-2 r²)/(4 - r²).

Now take the derivative with respect to r:

d/dr [ (-2 r²)/(4 - r²) ) ] = [ (-4 r)(4 - r²) ) + (2 r^3) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, that's [ (-4r)(4 - r^2) ) + (2 r^3) ].

Expanding: (-16 r +4 r^3) +2 r^3 = -16 r +6 r^3.

So the derivative is (6 r^3 -16 r) / (4 - r^2)^2.

So ∇² f = (1/r) * (6 r^3 -16 r)/(4 - r^2)^2 ) = [6 r^2 -16 ] / [ r (4 - r^2)^2 ) ].

So ∇² ln(E) = ∇² (C - ln(D)) ) = - ∇² ln(D) = - [ (6 r^2 -16 )/( r (4 - r^2)^2 ) ) ].

Now, the Gaussian curvature K is given by K = - (1/(2 E)) * ∇² ln(E).

Substituting:

E =32/(4 - r^2) =32/D.

So 1/(2 E) = (4 - r^2)/(64) = (D)/(64).

So K = - (D/(64)) * [ (6 r^2 -16 )/( r (4 - r^2 )^2 ) ) ].

Wait, D =4 - r², so (4 - r²)^2 = D². So:

K= - (D/(64)) * [ (6 r^2 -16 )/( r D^2 ) ) ] = - (1/(64)) * (6 r^2 -16)/( r D ) ).

Hmm, D is 4 - r², which is positive inside r=2.

Wait, simplifying:

K= [ -(6 r^2 -16) ] / [ 64 r (4 - r^2) ) ].

Hmm, this doesn't look constant. So the curvature is not constant, which would imply that the surface isn't a pseudosphere (which requires constant negative curvature). So this metric isn't for a pseudosphere. Hmm, that's conflicting with the question, which asks about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2.

Wait, but the question says the metric is given as ds²= ... and asks what's the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier in considering the area.

Wait, perhaps the given metric is for a pseudosphere, but I'm not correctly analyzing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the metric in terms of its relation to the pseudosphere. The radius of the pseudosphere is 2. So maybe the area is 4π, as it's a sphere-like surface. But wait, pseudosphere is a surface of infinite area.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The area of the pseudosphere (tractricoid) is actually infinite. Because as you approach the edge, the surface area element blows up. So the integral diverges. So the area is infinite. But the question gives the option D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are: A)0, B)4pi(x² + y²), C)4pi(x² - y²), D) +infty.

So if the area is infinite, the answer would be D.

But earlier, when I computed the area, the integral diverges, so the area is indeed infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but I thought the tractricoid has finite area. Oh wait, no. The tractricoid, when you spin a tractrix around, the surface area is actually finite. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me check.

Wait, the tractrix is a curve that has finite length. When you rotate it around an asymptote, the surface it forms (the tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's a finite area surface? Or is it infinite?

Wait, according to some sources, the tractricoid (pseudosphere) has finite area. For example, the surface area is 4π a², where a is the radius. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the parametrization. If the given metric is that of a hyperbolic plane, which is infinite, then the area would be infinite. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is the tractricoid, which is a finite surface.

Wait, but the hyperbolic plane is a 2D surface with negative curvature, but it's non-compact and has infinite area. The pseudosphere, on the other hand, is a compact surface with finite area. So which one does the given metric describe?

Hmm, perhaps the given metric is that of a hyperbolic space, which is infinite in extent, hence area infinite.

Wait, the given metric is in 2D, and the domain is x² + y² <4. So it's a finite disk, but with the conformal factor causing the area element to blow up as you approach the boundary (r approaches 2). So the area is indeed infinite.

Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite, so the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right).
\]

This is a conformally flat metric, meaning it can be written as \( ds^2 = E(dx^2 + dy^2) \), where \( E = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The area element in such a metric is \( dA = E \, dx \, dy \). Substituting \( E \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate \( dA \) over the region where the metric is defined. The denominator \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \) implies \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which is the interior of a circle of radius 2. Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral is straightforward:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

The radial integral is:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{32r}{u} \, dr = \int_0^4 \frac{16}{u} \, du.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \ln(u) \Big|_0^4.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln(u) \to -\infty \), making the integral diverge. Therefore, the total area is infinite.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, but the given metric describes a hyperbolic-like space with infinite extent and infinite area. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by this metric is infinite.

**Analysis of Options:**

- **A) 0:** Incorrect. The area is clearly not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \):** Incorrect. This is not a valid expression for the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \):** Incorrect. This is also not a valid expression for the area.
- **D) \( +\infty \):** Correct. The integral for the area diverges, indicating an infinite area.

Answer: D
