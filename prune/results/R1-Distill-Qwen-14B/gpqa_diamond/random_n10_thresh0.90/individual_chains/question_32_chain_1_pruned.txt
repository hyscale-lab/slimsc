Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I need to find the energy of the collider such that the nucleus's speed is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, I think. Because Li typically has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So first step: figure out the mass of the nucleus X. I remember that the mass of a nucleus isn't just the sum of the individual protons and neutrons because of mass defect and binding energy. But wait, maybe I can approximate it for this problem. Or perhaps I can just use the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons, but I'm not sure if that's accurate enough. Alternatively, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus. So, maybe I should find the rest mass of Li-6. Let me recall: a proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². A neutron is similar, around 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Calculating the total rest mass: 3 * (938) + 3 * (939.565). Let me compute that. 3 *938 is 2814, and 3*939.565 is 3*939 is 2817, plus 3*0.565 which is 1.695. So total is 2817 +1.695=2818.695. So sum is 2814 +2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. Wait, that's the sum of individual masses, but that would give a higher value than the actual nucleus because of binding energy. Oh, but wait, in reality, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum. So maybe this approach isn't the right way. Hmm, perhaps I should instead find the exact mass of Li-6.

I think I remember that the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Because, Li-7 is about 7.016 u, so Li-6 is about 6.015 u.

Wait, let me check. The exact value is probably something I should get from a table, but since I'm doing this as a thought process, I'll proceed with 6.015 u for Li-6.

1 atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So Li-6's mass would be 6.015 * 931.5 MeV.

Calculating that: 6 *931.5 =5589. 0.015 *931.5 is about 13.9725. So total is 5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV. Hmm, so that's about 5.6 GeV? Wait, 5603 MeV is 5.603 GeV. So the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is approximately 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the exact number. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact value. Since I can't actually look it up right now, I'll proceed with the 6.015 u value, leading to about 5.6 GeV.

So, the problem is about the energy of the nucleus X in the RHIC. The speed is given as 0.96c. I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma times its rest mass energy.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, given by 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈3.5714.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's calculate 1 - v²/c². v is 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714286.

So gamma is about 3.5714. Now, the rest mass energy is 5.603 GeV. So the total energy is 5.603 * 3.5714 ≈ let's compute that.

Calculating 5.603 *3.5714. Let me break it down:

5 *3.5714 =17.857.

0.603 *3.5714 ≈ Let's compute 0.6 *3.5714 = 2.1428, and 0.003 *3.5714 =0.0107, so total is 2.1428+0.0107=2.1535.

So 17.857 +2.1535 ≈19.0105 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the rest mass is correct. Let me double-check the mass calculation. If the nucleus is Li-6, which is 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), assuming each neutron and proton is about 938 MeV, but the actual mass is lower due to binding energy.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the concept of a nucleus as a single particle, so its rest mass is calculated as the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons minus the binding energy. But I think that without the exact mass, I should proceed with the given approximation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the formula for relativistic energy, E = gamma * m_0 c², where m_0 is the rest mass.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the mass of the nucleus is considered as the mass of the atom? No, because it's a nucleus. So it's just the nucleons, so Li-6 nucleus has 6 nucleons, so mass should be 6 * m_n. But wait, protons and neutrons have slightly different masses. Oh, but in practice, the mass of the nucleus is less than 6 * m_nucleon. Hmm.

Alternatively, the problem might not require knowing the exact mass. Wait, no, it's necessary to compute the energy. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with my earlier calculation.

So, the rest mass energy is approximately 5.603 GeV, and gamma is approximately 3.5714. So 5.603 *3.5714 ≈ 5.603 *3.5714.

Let me compute more accurately:

3.5714 is 25/7. So 5.603 * (25/7) = (5.603 *25)/7.

5.603 *25 = 140.075.

140.075 /7 =20.0107 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.01 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, maybe my approximation of the mass is off.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me re-calculate gamma.
