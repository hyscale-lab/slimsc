Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two parts, each involving a reaction. I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, let me break this down.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and another reagent A leads to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion (CN-) attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is electrophilic. So the mechanism would be the ketone reacting with NaCN in a nucleophilic addition, forming a cyanohydrin.

But wait, what conditions are needed for that? I think the reaction of ketones with CN- usually happens under basic conditions. But sometimes, it might require an acid catalyst. Or maybe the acid is generated in situ.

Wait, but when NaCN is used, it's a source of CN- ions. But if the solution is acidic, then maybe it protonates somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is carried out in a weakly acidic environment.

Wait, the product is a cyanohydrin. Let me think: the reaction of a ketone with HCN (or a source of CN- like NaCN in acidic conditions) would form a cyanohydrin. So the general reaction is R2CO + HCN → R2C(OH)CN.

In which case, what reagent A would provide the necessary conditions? If A is H3O+, that would make it acidic. So adding H3O+ (like adding acid) could protonate the CN- from NaCN, making HCN. Wait, no. Wait, NaCN is a salt; in aqueous solution, it's CN- and Na+.

But in acidic conditions, CN- would pick up a proton to become HCN. Hmm, but if we're adding HCN to the ketone, that's the reagent, but in the question, it's NaCN and reagent A.

Wait, maybe the reaction is done in acidic conditions to facilitate the addition. So if A is H3O+, then the solution is acidic, which might help the nucleophilic attack.

Alternatively, sometimes the reaction of ketones with NaCN requires HCN, which can be generated by adding an acid to NaCN. Because NaCN is a salt of a weak acid, so in water, it's basic. So to get HCN, you add an acid. So when you mix NaCN with an acid (like H3O+), you get HCN, which can then react with the ketone to form the cyanohydrin.

So maybe A is H3O+ for the first reaction. That would make sense. So for part A, the reagent is H3O+.

So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

So for the first reaction, the correct A is H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Looking at the product, the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

I remember that the hydrolysis of nitriles can give carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions are either strong acid with water and heat, or using a strong base like aqueous H2SO4 (like H2SO4 as a catalyst) or using something like KMnO4 under acidic conditions.

Wait, but in the presence of H2O and a reagent B, which could be acid or base.

Wait, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. So nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid.

Two common methods for nitrile hydrolysis: under acidic conditions, you usually get the amide first, which then goes to the acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different product.

Wait, but nitriles hydrolyzing to carboxylic acids typically require strong acidic conditions. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl with heat and water. Or sometimes, using a catalyst like H2SO4.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent B is in H2O. So the reaction is hydrolysis in water, with reagent B.

Another approach: the nitrile is in a molecule that has a hydroxyl group (the starting material is 2-hydroxy-...nitrile). So the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group.

So the reaction is converting -CN into -COOH. So the conditions must be such that the nitrile undergoes hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, it's usually H+ and heat. Under basic conditions, perhaps with strong bases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the possible reagents. The options for B are HCl (option A), CH3COOH (option B), HCl (option C), CH3COOH (option D). So looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but in the options, for the reagent B, the options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for B, possible options are HCl or CH3COOH.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is in H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Nitrile hydrolysis can be done in acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, but for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical conditions are strong acid (like HCl) with heat and water. Or sometimes, using KMnO
