Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is in its proper deprotonated form to chelate the metal effectively. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so probably won't affect the calculations here. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5×10^10. 

Wait, wait. I should recall what the formation constant (Kf) represents. Oh yeah, Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. So in this case, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2−, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Since the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, that would be the concentration of CaEDTA^2−. Let me denote [CaEDTA] as 0.02 M. So, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are both zero because the complex is formed from them. But wait, no, because the complex dissociates to some extent.

Wait, no. Wait, the solution has the complex already. So the initial complex is 0.02 M. Let me set up the variables. Let's say the concentration of the complex is [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. When it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-: 

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10. But wait, wait. Wait, Kf is the formation constant, so for the formation reaction, Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So in this problem, since the complex is dissociating, the dissociation constant (Kd) would be 1/Kf. Because Kd is for the reverse reaction.

So Kd = 1/(Kf) = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. But I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let me think again. The formation reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA^2-, Kf=5e10.

In the solution, we have 0.02 M of CaEDTA^2-. So the initial [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are zero. But that can't be right. Wait, no, because if the complex is present, it will dissociate a little bit. So we can model it using the dissociation constant.

So the dissociation reaction is:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Let me denote the change in concentration. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- produced when the complex dissociates. So, the expression for Kd is:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-]

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x. Since Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M.

So the equation becomes:

Kd ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02

We can solve for x:

x² = Kd * 0.02 = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4*(1e-13), square root is sqrt(4)=2, times (1e-13)^0.5=1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is like 3.16e-7, so 2*3.16e-7 is about 6.3e-7.

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Since x is the concentration of both Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the concentration of calcium ions in solution is 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Oh, wait, because Kd is 1/Kf. So yes, Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11. Then the equation is correct. And the approximation holds because Kd is so small, so x is negligible compared to 0.02.

So yeah, I think option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \rightleftharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f}
\]

Given \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) produced by dissociation of the complex. Since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \) is negligible compared to the initial concentration of the complex, so:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}
\]

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_d \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
