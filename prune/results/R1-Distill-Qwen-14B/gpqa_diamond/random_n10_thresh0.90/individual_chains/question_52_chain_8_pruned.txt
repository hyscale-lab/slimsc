Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question deals with the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has no spots, this ratio is higher than when it has spots. They observe that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes—comparing when there are no spots to when there are spots.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, and we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So, it's about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2.

Hmm, I remember that under LTE, the populations of energy levels are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy of the level. 

Wait, but in this case, the problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So when there are spots, the overall effective temperature is lower. But wait, the spots are cooler regions, right? So the star's overall photosphere is at a lower temperature when spots are present.

But how does that affect the ratio of Ti levels? Well, the ratio depends on the temperature because the exponential term is dependent on T. But wait, the star's entire photosphere isn't at 5500 K when spots are present. Only 40% is covered by spots which I assume are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. Or does the question model the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K? Because when the spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So maybe the average temperature of the photosphere is lower, but the parts without spots are still at 6000 K?

Wait, no, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the average might be lower, but the spots have a lower temperature, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. But since the photosphere is a mix of these regions, but the temperature in the photosphere would vary across the surface. But for the purpose of this problem, when they take measurements, they integrate over the entire surface, so the effective temperature is lower.

Wait, but when the question talks about the photospheric effective temperature, I think that's the overall temperature that the star presents to us, but in reality, the star's surface has a mix of hotter and cooler regions. But for the purposes of the Boltzmann factor in the photosphere, I think we should model each region's contribution. Or perhaps, given that the overall emission is lower, but the temperature affects each region's own emission. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it, considering that when the spots are present, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is 5500 K. So, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, so the photosphere's average T is lower.

Wait, but the Boltzmann distribution depends on the temperature of the regions being observed. If the photosphere is a mix of two temperatures, perhaps the observed line strength depends on the area covered and the respective temperatures.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. 

I think the key here is to consider the Saha equation and the Boltzmann equation. But the Saha equation deals with ionization, which isn't directly the issue here as we're dealing with neutral atoms. So probably it's just the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, actually, the ratio of higher energy level to lower is given by n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

So, if the temperature decreases, the exponential term decreases, so n2/n1 becomes smaller. So if the temperature is lower, the ratio of n2 to n1 is lower, meaning more in the lower level. So the ratio n1/n2 would increase.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, that's confusing. Because if temperature is lower, then n1/n2 would increase. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me think again. The observed ratio is n1/n2. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower.

So when T is lower, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)) )

Wait, no, wait, the Boltzmann factor is n_i = n_j * (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So for level 1 and level 2, assuming level 2 is higher than 1 (since transitions are from lower to higher for photons to be emitted), then E2 > E1. So ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive.

Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, because T is in the denominator. So the exponential term increases. So n1/n2 increases when T decreases.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I just thought.

Wait, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Let me see. If the ratio is n2/n1, then:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is same as (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So as T decreases, the exponent makes the term smaller, so n2/n1 decreases, so n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says that when spots are present, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So that would imply that when T is lower, the ratio is lower, which doesn't fit with the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me think again.

The problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So when the spots are present, the effective temp is lower. So when we have spots, the star's photosphere is cooler on average.

But when the star has spots, the observed ratio (n1/n2) is smaller than when it doesn't have spots. So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T))

When T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since T is in the denominator), so exp() increases, so n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots (i.e., when T is lower). So that's conflicting.

Hmm, this suggests that my initial understanding is incorrect. Maybe I'm missing something about the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition in question is an absorption line, and the equivalent width depends on the number of atoms in the excited state. Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the populations, not the absolute number.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star has spots, some parts of the photosphere are cooler, so the overall excitation of Ti is different. But since the star emits from a range of temperatures, the line strength might be a combination of hotter and cooler regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower, so the average temperature for the photosphere is lower. Therefore, for the same Ti atoms, the ratio would change based on the lower temperature.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases.
