Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because these multiple-choice questions can be tricky. Let me read through the question carefully and try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analog is too. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let's start by identifying what each part could represent.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction often suggests something like a metal reacting with an acid. For example, metals reacting with acids to produce hydrogen gas (H2). But wait, gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think: hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. Helium, maybe? No, that's not right. Wait, what's a gas where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons?

Wait, let's think about the possible gases. Hydrogen has H2, which is H (1 proton, 0 neutrons) Ã—2. So protons are 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. How about CO2? No, that's not a gas produced in such reactions. Maybe CO2 is a product, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the gas is something else.

Wait, if the gas's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about the possible elements. Let's think about each molecule. For example, if the molecule is H2O, but that's not a gas in most cases. Or perhaps it's a diatomic molecule.

Wait, another approach: the gas W. Let's think about possible diatomic gases where the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let me consider each atom in the molecule.

If W is H2, each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: what about CO2? No, that's a triatomic molecule. Wait, but the question says the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So for example, if the molecule is something like CH4, but that's not a gas here.

Wait, if the gas is CO, but that has one C and one O. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (in its most common isotope), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Wait, the molecule would have (6+8)=14 protons and (6+8)=14 neutrons. Oh wait, but that's the entire molecule. So in that case, the number of protons (14) equals the number of neutrons (14). Hmm, that fits. So gas W could be CO. But wait, when would X and Y produce CO? Maybe Y is carbon-containing? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is something else.

Wait, another thought: if W is CH4, but then CH4 has 5 protons and 5
