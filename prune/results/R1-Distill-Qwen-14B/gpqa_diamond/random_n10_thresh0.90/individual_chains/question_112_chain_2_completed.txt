Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think that means they are the standard basis states for spin-1/2 systems, like spin-up and spin-down along the z-axis.

The question asks me to calculate two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that sounds a bit tricky. Let me think about what operator that is.

So, the matrix A has elements Aij = 0 if i = j, and ħ/2 if i != j. For a two-level system (since we have |up> and |down>), the matrix would be 2x2. So, A should look like this:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, no. Because if i != j, but in a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are (1,2) and (2,1). So yeah, that's correct.

But wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices have specific forms. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So this operator A is similar to the Pauli X matrix but scaled. Let's see: A has off-diagonals as ħ/2, so A = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = (ħ/2) σ_x.

So, the operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A as well, because multiplying by a scalar doesn't change the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues would be scaled by (ħ/2).

The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so for A, the eigenvalues should be (ħ/2)(1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2. But wait, the problem says to find the probabilities of measuring in each eigenstate of the operator A. So the eigenstates are the corresponding eigenvectors of A.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the eigenstates of A. Let me find them. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. So, the measurement basis is these |+x> and |-x> states.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, then the square of the coefficients' magnitudes will give the probabilities.

But wait, |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me normalize it first. Because when they say it's proportional, that implies it's not necessarily normalized. So I'll have to normalize it.

Let me compute the normalization factor. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The norm is the inner product <alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Calculating each term: |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2. |2-i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the norm is 2+5=7. So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, |alpha> = [1+i, 2-i]^T / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express this state in terms of the |+x> and |-x> basis. Let me write the transformation.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to change basis, we can write:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Let me compute c_+ and c_-.

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

To find c_+, take the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>:

c_+ = < +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)] * [a; b] = (a + b)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, c_- = < -x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)] * [a; b] = (a - b)/sqrt(2).

Let me compute a + b and a - b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt7, b = (2 -i)/sqrt7.

a + b = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / sqrt7 = (3 + 0i)/sqrt7 = 3/sqrt7.

a - b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt7 = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt7.

So,

c_+ = (3/sqrt7) / sqrt2 = 3 / (sqrt7 * sqrt2) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- = ( (-1 + 2i) / sqrt7 ) / sqrt2 = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²: (3)^2 / 14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429. But looking at the options, option A has 0.64 as one of the probabilities.

Then, |c_-|² = | (-1 + 2i) |² / 14. The numerator is sqrt[ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] squared, so that's (1 +4)=5. So |c_-|² =5/14 ≈ 0.357. Hmm, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, but none of the options have exactly that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, my calculation for a - b: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1+i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i. So that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The |alpha> state in terms of |+x> and |-x> is c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>. So the probabilities are |c_+|² and |c_-|².

So |c_+|² is (3/sqrt(14))^2 =9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

|c_-|² is (sqrt( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ))^2 / (14) = (1+4)/14 =5/14≈0.3571.

But looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 and 5/14.

So the probabilities are approximately 64.29% and 35.71%, which would round to 0.64 and 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, but wait a second, the first part of the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator. Since the operator has two eigenvalues, each with a corresponding eigenstate, so the probabilities should sum to 1.

Wait, 9/14 is about 0.642857, and 5/14 is about 0.357143. Together, they sum to 14/14=1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 ... which doesn't match.

Wait, but let's see the options again. The first part is the probabilities, the second part is the average.

So, the average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, the average can be found using the eigenvalues and the probabilities.

The eigenvalues of A are + ħ/2 and - ħ/2.

So, the average value is (probability of +) * (ħ/2) + (probability of -) * (- ħ/2).

Which is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(- ħ/2) = [ (9 -5) / 14 ] * ħ/2 = (4/14) * ħ/2 = (2/7) * ħ/2 = (2 ħ)/(7 *2 ) = ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7.

Looking at the options, option A says the average is ħ/7. So the first part, the probabilities of 0.64 and 0.36 are approximately 9/14 and 5/14, which are 0.6428 and 0.3571. So the option A gives 0.64, 0.36, and average ħ/7. So that would be option A.

Wait, but let me cross-check. Alternatively, I can compute the average using the matrix representation.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt7, (2-i)/sqrt7 ]^T.

Matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0 ].

So, <A> = |alpha|^T * A * |alpha>.

Wait, let's compute that.

|alpha> is (a, b)^T where a=(1+i)/sqrt7, b=(2-i)/sqrt7.

So, A|alpha> is [ (0)(a) + (ħ/2)(b) , (ħ/2)(a) + 0*(b) ] = [ (ħ/2) b , (ħ/2) a ].

Then, <A> is (a*, b*) * [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ].

Which is a* * (ħ/2) b + b* * (ħ/2) a.

But a* is (1-i)/sqrt7, b is (2 -i)/sqrt7.

So,

= (1-i)/sqrt7 * (ħ/2) * (2 -i)/sqrt7 + (2 +i)/sqrt7 * (ħ/2) * (1 +i)/sqrt7.

Let me compute each term.

First term:

(1 -i)(2 -i) = (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = (1) -3i.

So first term: (1 -3i) * (ħ/2) * (1/7).

Second term:

(2 + i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 +i^2 = 2 +3i -1 = (1) +3i.

So second term: (1 +3i) * (ħ/2) * (1/7).

Adding both terms:

[ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] * (ħ/(2*7)).

Which is (2) * (ħ/(14)) )= (2 ħ)/(14) )= ħ/7.

So that's correct. So the average is indeed ħ/7.

So now, the probabilities are 9/14≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is ħ/7. So that's correct.

But wait, let me make sure about the probabilities.

Wait, the state is in |+x> and |-x> basis. So the probability of measuring +ħ/2 is 9/14≈0.6429, which would round to 0.64, and the other is 5/14≈0.3571, which rounds to 0.36. So option A matches.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator with matrix representation A, where Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of the operator must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm:
\[
\|α\|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A is represented by the matrix:
\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x,
\]
where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of σ_x are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up⟩ + |down⟩ \right), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |up⟩ - |down⟩ \right).
\]
These eigenstates are also the eigenstates of A, with eigenvalues:
\[
\lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2}, \quad \lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in the {|+x⟩, |-x⟩} basis
To compute the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, express |α⟩ in this basis. Using the definitions of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:
\[
|α⟩ = c_+ |+x⟩ + c_- |-x⟩,
\]
where:
\[
c_+ = \langle +x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle up | + \langle down | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right),
\]
\[
c_- = \langle -x | α \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle up | - \langle down | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩ \right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
c_+ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute probabilities
The probabilities of measuring |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are:
\[
P(+x) = |c_+|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |c_-|^2 = \left| \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{1 + 4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the average value of A
The average value of A is given by:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α | A | α \rangle.
\]
Using the eigenvalues of A and the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9\hbar}{28} - \frac{5\hbar}{28} = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is ħ/7. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
