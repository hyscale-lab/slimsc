Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says: We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. 

Wait, the first thing I should do is figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Because the 20 cm³ of acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 liters. 

The initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Diluting to 0.04 L, the new concentration is moles / volume. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right, 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, that means we've added 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. Let's calculate the equivalence point first because that's when we can find out how much NaOH is needed.

Equivalence point: moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. 

Wait, but the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. 

So for 25% titration, we add 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. 

Now, the pH at 25% titration is before the equivalence point. Since it's a weak acid being titrated with a strong base, the solution at 25% will be a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

But wait, at 25% titration, how much of the acetic acid has reacted? 25% of the moles. So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. 

So, moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.001 mol. After reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol. 

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, which is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L. 

So the concentrations are [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M, [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]). 

pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let's calculate that. 

1.85e-5 is 1.85 ×10^-5. Log(1.85)=0.267, so log(1.85e-5)= -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. 

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. That's approximately 4.26. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the ratio 0.00025 /0.00075 is 1/3. So the log(1/3) is -0.477, so yeah, same result.

So pH at 25% is around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D is 4.57, which doesn't match. So the first part of the answer is 4.26.

Now the second part: equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). But since acetate is a weak base, the solution will be basic. 

So the solution at equivalence point is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates completely in solution, so the concentration of acetate ions is determined by the moles of acetate and the total volume.

Moles of NaOH added at equivalence point: 10 cm³ × 0.1 M = 0.001 mol. Which is the same as moles of acetic acid initially, so moles of acetate are 0.001 mol.

The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) + 10 cm³ NaOH = 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, since CH3COO^- is a base, it will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. 

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH^- can be found using the approximation for weak bases. The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]. Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration (0.02 M), so:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is about 3.288e-6. Then pOH = -log(3.288e-6). 

Log(3.288e-6) is log(3.288) + log(1e-6). Log(3.288) is approx 0.516, so pOH ≈ 5.484. pH = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516, approximately 8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is around 8.52. 

Looking back at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52 → this seems to match both parts.

But wait, let's think again. Are there any mistakes in the calculation? Let me check the equivalence point again. 

Wait, the solution at equivalence point is 0.02 M sodium acetate. Wait, no: the moles are 0.001, and the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L), so 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

The Kb is correct, 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Then x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is 3.288e-6. So yes, [OH^-] is ~3.288e-6. 

pOH is about 5.48, so pH is 8.52. So that's correct.

So the two pH values are 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by calculating the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we calculate the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. Since the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol, and the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the NaOH required for equivalence is added. Thus, the volume of NaOH added is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at 25%} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since acetic acid reacts with NaOH in a 1:1 ratio, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right).
\]

The ratio \(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333\), and \(\log(0.333) \approx -0.477\). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ion. The moles of acetate ion are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \([\text{OH}^-] = x\). Then:

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.516 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
