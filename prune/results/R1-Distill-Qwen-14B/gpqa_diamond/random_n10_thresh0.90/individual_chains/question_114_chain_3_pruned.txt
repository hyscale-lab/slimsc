Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. It's about reagents and reactions, which I remember from my organic chemistry class. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Select the suitable reagents for the following reactions.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different A and B combinations.

Hmm. I think I need to break this down into each reaction individually and figure out what's happening.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via a substitution reaction, but wait, under what conditions?

Oh, right! The formation of a nitrile from a ketone usually involves something like the Stephen reduction or maybe a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, ketones can't undergo nucleophilic substitution easily because they're not good leaving group substrates. Oh wait, maybe it's the formation via a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrin formation is when a ketone reacts with a nitrile in the presence of an acid catalyst, right?

Wait, so the cyanohydrin reaction. The mechanism is that a ketone (like butan-2-one) reacts with a cyanide ion (from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a new bond, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group after the leaving of the protonated carbonyl oxygen (as H2O).

So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. The product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that out. The structure would be CH(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, but wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so when it reacts, the CN adds to the carbonyl carbon, which is the second carbon. So the product would have the OH and CN on the same carbon, which is C2. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the name given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me count the carbons. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure must be CH2CH2C(OH)(CH3)CN? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering.

Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on the first (since it's butanenitrile, so CH2CH2CH2CN). So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be: CN-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2- ? No, wait, but butanenitrile has four carbons. Let me think again. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on carbon 1, then carbon 2 has a hydroxy and methyl group. So structure is CH2(CN)-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-? No, wait, that's four carbons?

Wait, butanenitr
