Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that we've got a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral structure is a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So, in this case, the angles α, β, and γ are each 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along one of the lattice parameters, right? So that must be the edge length, 'a' in a cubic system, but here it's rhombohedral, so maybe 'a' is the same in all directions.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance (d_{hkl}) in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, that's for a cubic system. Oh, but here it's rhombohedral. Hmm, so I need to adjust the formula for rhombohedral structures.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but in this case, since it's a rhombohedral crystal, a = b = c. Let's call this common edge length 'a'. The angles between the edges are all the same, 30 degrees each. So I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

I remember there's a general formula for interplanar distances in any crystal system, which involves the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. The formula is more complicated because it includes the angles between the lattice vectors. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (sin² α + sin² β - sin² γ + 2 sin α sin β cos γ)) / (a^2) ) + ... )

Wait, that sounds complicated. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach. Alternatively, I think the formula can be simplified when all the angles are equal and the lattice is rhombohedral. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell can be considered as a cube that's been deformed. So perhaps the formula is
