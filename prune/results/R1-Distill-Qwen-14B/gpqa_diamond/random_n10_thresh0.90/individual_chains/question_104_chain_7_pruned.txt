Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So the star wobbles, and we see shifts in the spectral lines.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detected shifts are 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1's.

Wait, I think the RV method relates the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift (K) to the mass of the planet and other orbital parameters. The formula I remember is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin(i)) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * something... Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version. Since the stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets' masses are similar, perhaps the formula can be simplified.

Oh right! The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = ( (2 π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_* )^(2/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) ). But since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_* >> M_p, so the denominator (1 + M_p/M_*) is approximately 1. So we can ignore that term.

So K simplifies to K ≈ ( (2 π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_* )^(2/3) ) * (1/√(1 + e²))... Wait, but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So the denominator sqrt(1 + e²) becomes 1. So that part is 1. So K ≈ ( (2 π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_*)^(2/3) )

Wait, but in our case, both stars have the same mass (M_* same for both), and the planet masses are similar (so M_p similar). So M_p / M_* is the same for both planets. So the ratio K1 / K2 would depend on P1 and P2.

Wait, let me write it down. Let's denote K1 for planet #1 and K2 for planet #2. 

K1 ≈ ( (2 π G) / (c P1) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_*)^(2/3)
K2 ≈ ( (2 π G) / (c P2) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_*)^(2/3)

So taking the ratio K1/K2 = [ ( (2 π G)/(c P1) )^(1/3) ] / [ ( (2 π G)/(c P2) )^(1/3) ) ] 

Simplify that. The (2 π G)/c terms are the same, so they cancel when taking the ratio. So we have (1/3) power of (P2/P1). Or actually, the ratio becomes ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no: Let me think again. Because K1/K2 = [ (P2)^(1/3) ] / [ (P1)^(1/3) ] ] 

Wait, because it's (1/(P1))^(1/3) divided by (1/(P2))^(1/3) ) → (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) → So (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

Which implies that P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 

Wait, but wait, the observed K for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 is 7. So K1 =5, K2=7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but wait, that gives P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So Planet #2’s period is roughly 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 / P1 is 0.364, so planet #2's period is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is less than one, meaning P2 is shorter.

Wait, but the question is phrased: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If the ratio is 0.36
