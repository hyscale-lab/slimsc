Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring shifts in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift in wavelength is related to the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these, and we have the wavelength shifts for each.

Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, I think the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the planet's orbital period, among other factors.

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )) * ( ( (1) ) / ( (2π)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) 

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_p is negligible compared to M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. And since the planets have circular orbits, e is 0, so (1 - e²)^(0.5) is 1. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, maybe an easier way is to think about the Doppler shift and the velocity. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) relates to the velocity via the Doppler effect formula: Δλ / λ₀ = v_r / c, where λ₀ is the rest wavelength, v_r is the radial velocity, and c is the speed of light. Since the shifts are small, we can approximate Δλ proportional to v_r.

So, the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to Δλ. So, K1 = 5 milliangstroms, K2 =7 milliangstroms. So K2/K1 =7/5 =1.4.

But wait, K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Let me think. The formula for K is:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (P yr)^(-1/3) ) / (M_*^(-2/3) ) )

Wait, another approach: since both stars have the same mass as the Sun, M_* is the same for both. And the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun, so M_p << M_*, so we can ignore M_p in the denominator. So, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3) ) 

Wait, alternatively, the formula might be: 

K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) / ( (2π c )^(1/3) ) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^2 ) )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relationship between K and the orbital period P.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_*^(2/3)) ( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate (1 + M_p/M_*) ≈ 1. So,

K ≈ (2π G )^(1/3) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but the mass of the planet is the same for both planets (similar to Neptune), and the star masses are the same. So M_p and M_* are constants. Therefore, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). 

Wait, but wait—K is the velocity semi-amplitude. So, larger K means higher velocity, which is detected as a larger shift in the spectral lines. So, if K is larger, that implies that the velocity of the star is higher. 

But in this scenario, K is given for each planet as the shift. So, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is7. So K2/K1 =7/5=1.4. 

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), that would mean that if K increases, P decreases. Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^(3). 

Wait, let me think again. Let's write the relationship between K and P. 

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Since M_p and M_* are the same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/K^3. 

Wait, no, more accurately: 

K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (P yr)^(-1/3) ) / (M_*^(2/3) ) )

But in this problem, M_p is similar for both, M_* is same, and we can ignore sin i since both are similar (we can assume i is same or sin i is same, as the problem doesn't specify). So K is proportional to P^(-1/3). 

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3) 

Wait, no, because K1 is proportional to P1^(-1/3), K2 to P2^(-1/3). So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). 

Wait, let's write it correctly.

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → K ∝ P^(-1/3). So, K1 = C * P1^(-1/3), K2 = C * P2^(-1/3), where C is a constant.

Taking the ratio: K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Wait, no, wait:

K1 = C * (P1)^(-1/3)

K2 = C * (P2)^(-1/3)

So, K2/K1 = [ (P2)^(-1/3) ] / [ (P1)^(-1/3) ) ] 

Which is (P1/P2)^(1/3) )

Because (a^(-1/3))/(b^(-1/3)) )= (b/a)^(1/3).

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Rearranging:

(P1/P2) = (K2/K1)^3

Wait, no:

Wait, solving for P2 in terms of P1. Let me re-express.

We have K1 = C * P1^(-1/3)

K2 = C * P2^(-1/3)

Divide K2 by K1:

K2/K1 = (P2^(-1/3)) / (P1^(-1/3)) ) → (P1/P2) )^(1/3)

So,

(K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, wait, let me solve step by step.

Given K2 = (C) * P2^(-1/3)

K1 = (C) * P1^(-1/3)

Divide both equations: K2/K1 = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3)

So,

(K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the third power:

(K2/K1)^3 = (P1/P2) → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

So, the ratio P2/P1 is equal to (K1/K2)^3.

Wait no: if (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3), then

(K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3 → (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, the orbital period of planet #2 is (K1/K2)^3 times the period of planet #1.

Since K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K1/K2 =5/7.

So (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

So, P2 is 0.36 times P1 → it's shorter, so P2 is shorter by a factor of 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, which means it's 1/0.36 ≈ 2.78 times shorter. But the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. Since it's shorter, the factor would be less than 1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

But wait, the options given are A) ~0.36, B) ~1.40, C) ~1.96, D) ~0.85.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, meaning planet #2's period is about 0.36 times planet #1's period. So the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the ratio is 0.36 → so P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the answer is approximately 0.36 times. Which is option A.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have mixed up P1 and P2. Let me re-express.

Wait, I have that (K2/K1) = (P1/P2 )^(1/3 )

So, let me get the ratio P2/P1.
