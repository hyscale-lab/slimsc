Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics question. Hmm, let's read it again carefully. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between the two levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! That relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime of a state. The principle says that ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the lifetime (time uncertainty) can't be smaller than a certain value.

The goal is to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them should be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart; they'd look like a single state.

So, for each state, we can calculate the uncertainty in energy. Let's see, the formula would be ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). But wait, sometimes it's approximated as ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, depending on the exact formulation. I think for this purpose, using ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt) is better because it's the precise form, but sometimes people use ħ/(Δt) as an estimate. Probably, the exact factor might not matter for the order of magnitude here.

Let me think, the Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should probably convert units. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602 × 10^-19 joules. So, let's compute the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, but the lifetimes are different. The first state has a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, and the second is 1e-8 seconds. So, each has a different energy uncertainty. To clearly distinguish the two, the energy difference must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than either of the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, no. Let me think. Each state has its own uncertainty. The overall uncertainty when measuring would probably be the smaller of the two, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference has to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement. Wait, the measurement setup would involve some time, but I'm not exactly sure. Let's approach it step by step.

First, calculate the energy uncertainty for each state.

For the first state, Δt1 = 1e-9 s. So, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s)/(2 * 1e-9 s) = approx 5.27e-26 J.

Convert that to eV: 5.27e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.602e-19 J) ≈ 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV. So about 3.29 × 10^-7 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 1e-9 is 10^-9 s. So, ħ/(2Δt) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-9 = approximately 5.27e-26 J. 

Convert J to eV: 5.27e-26 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV. So 5.27e-26 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.29e-7 eV, which is 3.29 × 10^-7 eV. So about 3.3e-7 eV.

For the second state, Δt2 = 1e-8 s. So, ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) = 1.0545e-34 / 2e-8 = 5.27e-27 J. Convert to eV: 5.27e-27 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV. So approximately 3.29e-8 eV, which is about 3.3e-8 eV.

So the uncertainties are about 3.3e-7 eV and 3.3e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. We want this difference to be larger than the uncertainty so that they are distinguishable. But which uncertainty matters more? Hmm.

Wait, actually, if the two states have different lifetimes, when you measure their energies, the uncertainty in each measurement is determined by the respective lifetime. But when you're trying to distinguish between E1 and E2, the energy difference should be bigger than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the larger of the two? Because if the energy difference is bigger than both, you can clearly tell them apart.

So, let's think. Suppose E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE. To distinguish them, ΔE should be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if ΔE is less than either, the energy levels could overlap in the uncertainty. Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the system. Maybe the system's overall uncertainty is the average or something. Hmm. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, another approach: The energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy measurement. The uncertainty in the energy measurement would depend on the time over which the measurement is made. But I'm not exactly sure about how the lifetimes of the states translate into measurement time.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy uncertainty is given by ΔE = ħ/(τ), where τ is the lifetime. Wait, I thought the formula was ΔE ≈ ħ/(2τ), but sometimes people use ħ/τ as an approximation. Oh, perhaps the exact factor (1/2 or 1) doesn't matter for the order of magnitude, so let's proceed using ħ/τ.

So, for the first state, ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9) ≈ 1e-34 / 1e-9 ≈ 1e-25 J. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, ħ is about 1e-34 J·s. So, 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25 J. Then, converting to eV: 1e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.25e-7 eV. So about 6.25e-7 eV, which is 6.25 ×10^-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state, ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8 s) = 1e-34 / 1e-8 = 1e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties are approximately 6.25e-7 eV and 6.25e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but why do we have two different uncertainties? Because each state has a different lifetime, leading to different energy uncertainties. Now, when we measure the energy levels, the uncertainty in each measurement (E1 and E2) would be ΔE1 and ΔE2 respectively. 

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Because if the difference is smaller than the sum, there's a possibility that the two energies could overlap within the uncertainties.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference just needs to be larger than the individual uncertainties. Wait, but which one? If ΔE > max(ΔE1, ΔE2), then it would certainly be larger than both. So for the first state, ΔE1 is 6.25e-7 eV, and for the second, 6.25e-8 eV. So the larger of the two is 6.25e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than 6.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1e-9 eV → that's 0.001e-6 eV → way smaller than 6.25e-7.

Option B) 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

Option C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. That's way larger than 6.25e-7.

Option D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV. Smaller than 6.25e-7.

So the only option that is larger than 6.25e-7 eV is option C) 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of each state. So if E2-E1 is greater than ΔE1 and ΔE2, then it's distinguishable. But in this case, the larger uncertainty is 6.25e-7 eV. So the energy difference must be larger than that, otherwise, if it's smaller, the two energy levels would overlap in their uncertainty, making them indistinguishable.

So, the correct answer would be option C, which is 1e-4 eV, as that's much larger than 6.25e-7 eV.

Wait, but let me think again. If the two states have different lifetimes, when you measure them, is the uncertainty in the energy difference equal to the sum of their individual uncertainties? Or is it just the maximum of the two? Hmm.

Wait, the energy difference would have
