Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so that means Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Because of Kepler's laws.

Both have circular orbits, which is probably important because eccentricity can affect the chance of transit, but since they're both circular, maybe that's not a factor here.

The host stars are different. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So more massive star but same radius. That makes me think the star with Planet_1 is probably hotter, but I'm not sure if that matters here.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula I think is something like (R_p / R_s)² * (a / R_s), where R_p is the planet radius, R_s the star's radius, and a the semi-major axis. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective. Oh wait, the geometric probability for a transit is proportional to (R_s + R_p)² / a², but wait, no, the formula I'm trying to recall is the probability P ~ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(R_s)).

Wait, no, perhaps the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/(R_s)))^2? No, that doesn't sound right. Let me get this straight. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned so that it passes in front of the star. The formula is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(R_s)) / something... Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of the orbital inclination. The probability that the planet transits is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a/(R_s)))^2. Wait, no, maybe it's (R_p + R_s)^2 / a². No, that can't be right.

Wait, I think the geometric probability P is given by P = (R_p + R_s)^2 / a², but wait, when the planet is much smaller than the star, R_p << R_s, so it's approximately (2 R_p R_s) / a^2. No, wait, actually, the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look it up mentally. Oh right, the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is approx (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s))^(-2), no, wait, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the correct formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p)/(R_s) )^2 * (a/(R_s)) / (something else). Hmm, perhaps another approach. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth (so π R_s²) to the area that would cause a transit, which is when the planet's orbital plane is such that it passes in front. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance, but that's R_s over a, but perhaps I should think in terms of the distance in the same units as the star's radius.

Wait, another approach: the transit condition occurs when the planet's orbital inclination is such that the planet's path crosses the star's disk. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can be in front of the star (a circle) to the total possible area (a larger circle). So if the star has radius R_s, and the planet's orbit has a semi-major axis a (in units where the distance is much larger than R_s, which it is), then the probability is approximately (R_s /
