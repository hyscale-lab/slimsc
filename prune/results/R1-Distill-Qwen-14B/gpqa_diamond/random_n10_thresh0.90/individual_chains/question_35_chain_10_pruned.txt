Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. The matrix is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and then choose the correct statement among the options A to D.

Hmm. So, first, let's write down what S looks like. The matrix S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So the operator Ay is c multiplied by this S matrix.

Wait, but wait. S here is 2x2, which makes sense because the spin-1/2 particles have 2x2 matrices for their Pauli matrices. So, I think S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and the Y matrix is [0 -i; i 0].

Wait, actually, the Pauli Y matrix is often written as [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which matches what S is here. So S is sigma_y, the Pauli Y matrix.

So Ay = c * sigma_y, where sigma_y is the Pauli matrix. The eigenvalues of sigma_y are known, right? Because the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are ±1, since they square to the identity matrix.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So if S is sigma_y, then S^2 = I, the identity matrix. So for any eigenvalue a of Ay, since Ay = c S, then (Ay)^2 = c^2 S^2 = c^2 I.

So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(eigenvalues of S). Since S's eigenvalues are ±1, then Ay's eigenvalues are ±c.

Wait, but let's compute this properly. Let me write down the operator Ay as c * S.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So to find eigenvalues, I need to solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix Ay is:

[ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i , (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

So the matrix is (h/(4π)) multiplied by [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So this is the same as c * S, where c = h/(4π).

The characteristic equation is determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i c) ]
[ (i c), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i c) * (i c) ) = a² - [ (-i)(i) c² ].

Wait, (-i c) * (i c) equals (-i)(i) c². Let's calculate (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1, so (-i)*i = -(i^2) = 1.

So determinant becomes a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ±c, which is ±h/(4π).

Wait, but wait the options don't have h/(4π) as the eigenvalues. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, but that can't be right because eigenvalues a are real numbers, right? Because the angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues. Wait, wait, wait—no, wait a second. Wait, the operator is Hermitian, so the eigenvalues must be real. So any options suggesting complex eigenvalues are wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π
