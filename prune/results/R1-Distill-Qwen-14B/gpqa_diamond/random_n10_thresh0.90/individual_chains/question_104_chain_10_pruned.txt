Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So the question goes: Two stars, same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data here is the periodic shift in the spectral lines: Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's gravity, and we measure the velocity change. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (P/(1 day))^( -1/3 )

Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period (P). Oh wait, there's another approach. The RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period and distance.

But in this question, the stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like, so same M_p). Both are in circular orbits, so eccentricity e is zero. So the main variables are the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Wait, so for circular orbits, the formula simplifies. The formula for K is something like:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * π) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 )^(1/3) )

But wait, when M_p is much smaller than M_star, which it is since Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, and the star is Sun-like (about 333,000 Earth masses), so M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the denominator is roughly (M_star)^2.

So K ≈ [ (G * P ) / (2 π) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), same star mass. And sin i is the same? Well, the problem doesn't mention anything about inclination, but since both are detected, I think we can assume sin i is the same for both, because if one were edge-on (sin i=1), the other would have to be as well to produce a detectable signal. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume the same sin i for both, as it's not given as varying.

So K is proportional to (P)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (2 π) / (P) ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, maybe I should look for a more straightforward relation. I think the key is that the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the star's mass and also depends on the planet's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination, and the orbital parameters.

From what I recall, the formula can be written as:

K = (v0) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star) ) * ( (P / (2 π)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a^(1/3)) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better way. Another version of the formula is:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe I should refer to the scaling relations. Because in this problem, the stars and planets are similar, so the only variables are K and P.

So since K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. Because K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_star) ) * ( P )^(-1/3) ), approximately, assuming M_p << M_star.

So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then K1/K2 = ( (P2 / P1) )^(1/3) )

Wait, wait, let me get the proportionality right. Let me consider:

K ∝ (M_p / M_star) * (P)^(-1/3) )

But since M_p and M_star are same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ P^(-1/3)

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let's think again: if other factors are same, then K is proportional to (P)^(-1/3). So if K increases, P decreases, and vice versa.

So the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But wait, wait, since K = constant * (M_p / M_star) * (P)^(-1/3) ), so K1/K2 = ( (P2/P1) )^(-1/3 )

Wait, no, let me write it properly. Let's say K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * P^(-1/3). Because for larger P, the semi
