Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The star moves towards and away from us, causing the spectral lines to shift.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both have circular orbits. So planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, but wait. How does the shift relate to the orbital period? I remember that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the velocity variation, which is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period, among other things.

The formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(something). Wait, no, maybe it's the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula.

Right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_s + M_p)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * sin(i) ] / ( (P)^(1/3) * c )

But wait, when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, like in this case, M_p << M_s, so M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So the formula simplifies.

Let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_s)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/c )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, but I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(1/3) P^(1/3})). Because when the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, the denominator terms simplify.

So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s)^(1/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

But in this problem, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both planets. The inclination i, well, since the orbits are circular and the RV method detects the Doppler shift, but I think the problem assumes that the inclination is the same for both, so sin i is the same. Alternatively, perhaps it's possible that the problem assumes that the RV semi-amplitude is directly proportional to the velocity, which is what we measure.

Wait, wait, the problem gives the shift in wavelength. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity. The formula for the Doppler shift in terms of velocity is delta_lambda / lambda = v/c. So the velocity is (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

But both stars have the same mass and are presumably the same temperature, so the same lambda for the spectral line. Let's say the same line is observed, so lambda is the same. So the velocity shift v is proportional to delta_lambda.

So for planet #1, delta_lambda1 = 5 mA, so v1 is proportional to 5. For planet #2, delta_lambda2 is 7, so v2 is proportional to 7. So K is proportional to the velocity shift. So K2 = 7/5 * K1?

Wait, no, because K is the semi-amplitude of velocity. So K is the same as v, since each shift corresponds to the same velocity. So K1 is proportional to 5, K2 proportional to 7.

So from the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_s)^(1/3) P^(1/3) ) )

But M_p is same for both, M_s same as well. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, let's arrange it. Let me write the equation.

K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 sin i1) / (M_s1^(1/3) P1^(1/3)) ) ] / [ (M_p2 sin i2) / (M_s2^(1/3) P2^(1/3)) ) ]

But M_p1 = M_p2, M_s1 = M_s2, and assuming sin i1 = sin i2 (same inclination, which is probably a safe assumption since the problem doesn't state otherwise), then K1/K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / (P1^(1/3) ) )

So K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But K1 / K2 = (5 mA) / (7 mA) ) = 5/7.

So 5/7 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (5/7)^3 = P2 / P1

So P2 = P1 * (5^3)/(7^3) = P1 * (125)/(343) ≈ P1 * 0.364.

Wait, that can't be right because the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.364 times P1, that means it's shorter, not longer. So that would mean the answer is about 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. So K = constant / P^(1/3)

So K1 = c / P1^(1/3)

K2 = c / P2^(1/3)

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Which gives P2 = ( (K1 / K2 )^3 ) * P1.

Wait, no, earlier I think I inverted that. Let me correct.

Wait, from K = c / P^(1/3), so P = (c/K)^3.

So P is proportional to 1/(K^3 )

So P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2 )^3

Because K2 is larger, so K1/K2 is less than 1.

So K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1, so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So P2 is shorter than P1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be P2/P1. So 0.36 times, which is 0.36. So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but wait! Because I'm getting confused with which is P2 and P1. Let's rephrase.

The star with planet #1 has a shift of 5 mA, so K1 is 5. The star with planet #2 has a shift of 7 mA, K2 is 7.

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), higher K means shorter period.

So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is shorter than P1.

So P2 = P1 * (K1 / K2 )^3.

Wait, because if K is higher, P is lower.

So, substituting, P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 ≈ P1 * (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that's P2 / P1 = 0.36. So the answer is approximately 0.36, which is option A.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the velocity variation, \( K \), is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, \( P \). The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets with the same mass and host stars of the same mass, the ratio of their orbital periods can be derived from the ratio of their RV semi-amplitudes. Let \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \) represent the semi-amplitudes for planet #1 and planet #2, respectively. Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), we have:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{
