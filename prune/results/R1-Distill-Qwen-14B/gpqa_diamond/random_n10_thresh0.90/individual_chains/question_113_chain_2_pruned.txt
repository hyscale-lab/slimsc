Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the chemical formula of an unknown compound using the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in this region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids, but wait, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm, those are strong. 1700 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O), which could be in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. That makes me think it's maybe a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution. But wait, 1650 could also be an aromatic C=C stretching. Or maybe it's an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not that.

So, the 1700 peak is probably a carbonyl, so the compound has a C=O group. The broad peak suggests -OH, so maybe something like an ester? Because esters have both a carbonyl and an -OH group (even though in esters, the -OH is part of an ether linkage, but wait, no. Wait, esters have O in the carbonyl and an ether-like oxygen. Wait, maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol? Or perhaps an aldehyde and an alcohol? But then the IR would show both peaks. Alternatively, maybe a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, but the given peak is at 3000. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the broad absorption is very broad at 3000. That's more typical for an -OH group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch, usually around 2500-3300, but the peak here is at 3000. Also, their carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, but they have a strong absorption around 2500-3000 due to the O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group. 

Then, the NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So that suggests the molecule has a double bond, probably a vinyl group somewhere. So maybe an ester with a double bond? Or a ketone with a double bond?

Looking at the Mass Spec: the fragment peak is at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be (CH3)2O (which is 45: 12*2 +1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2O is 2*(12+3) +16= 24 +16=40. Wait, 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O fragment, like formaldehyde (HCHO) is 30. Or maybe a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O? No, wait, 45: C3H7O is (12*3)+(7)+(16)=36+7+16=60. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Let me think about common fragments. The mass 45 could correspond to a (CH2)2O group or maybe a (CH3)CO, which is 58? Hmm, wait, (CH3)CO would be 3*12 + 7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. Not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O? Not sure. Wait, 45 could be C2H5O (45=24+5+16=45). So, maybe a fragment like (CH2CH2O)-. Or perhaps a fragment like (CH3O)CO-? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the molecular formulas given. The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

We need to determine which one fits.

Let me think about each possibility.

The IR has a carbonyl at 1700, so looking for a molecule with a C=O. So the options with carbonyl groups would be those with O and double bonds. So the possibilities are:

A) C6H12O2: possible structures could be esters, which have both a carbonyl and an ether linkage.

C) C6H10O2: this also has two oxygen atoms. Could be an ester or a ketone with another O-containing group.

Hmm, but wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule must have a double bond. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation. The formula for each option:

Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here.

A) C6H12O2: C=6, H=12, O=2.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 1.

So DoU is 1. That can be a ring or a double bond. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So one double bond.

B) C6H10O: DoU = (14 -10)/2= 2. So either two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

C) C6H10O2: DoU=(14 -10)/2=2. Same as B.

D) C6H12O: DoU=(14-12)/2=1.

So, the presence of vinyl hydrogens means there is at least one double bond. So the DoU must be at least 1, which all except maybe some have.

But looking at the IR, the 1650 cm^-1 peak. That's another peak, possibly a double bond (C=C) stretching. Because C=C absorption is usually around 1600-1680 cm^-1. So if the compound has both a carbonyl (from 1700) and a C=C (from 1650), then the DoU must be at least 2 (one for C=O, another for C=C). Wait, but C=O is a double bond, so that's one DoU. C=C is another. So total DoU 2.

Which options have a DoU of 2? Let's recalculate:

A) DoU=1: so only one double bond or ring. If a carbonyl (DoU=1) and no C=C, then the 1650 peak might be from something else. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring, which would have higher absorption. Wait, benzene's C=C is around 1450-1600, but substituted benzene can have higher. Alternatively, perhaps a conjugated carbonyl, like in an enone system, which could shift the carbonyl to a lower wavenumber.

Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is a C=C in a conjugated system. So if the compound has both a carbonyl and a C=C, then DoU would be 2.

So looking for options with DoU=2.

Option B: C6H10O: DoU=2.

Option C: C6H10O2: DoU=2.

Options A and D: DoU=1. So if the compound has two double bonds (C=O and C=C), then options B and C.

So now, let's think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z=45. Hmm, what could that be.

Mass of 45: possible fragments.

Looking at the molecular formulas:

Option B: C6H10O. Molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. (6*12)+(10)+(32)=72+10+32=114.

So for option C, the molecular weight is 114. A fragment of 45 would be about 40% of the molecule. Maybe a breaking off of a smaller group.

What's the molecular formula for 45? 45 = (12a + 1b +16c). Let's see possible combinations.

Option 1: C3H3O. 3*12=36, 3=3, 16=16. 36+3+16=55. No.

Option 2: C3H7O. 36 +7 +16=60.

Option3: C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=61.

Wait, perhaps it's a (CH3)2CO fragment, which is 58. Hmm, not 45. Alternatively, maybe a (CH2)3O group. 12*3=36 +8 (for 3 CH2 and O would be 32? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a fragment that's CH2O (formaldehyde) is 30.

Wait, another approach: 45 could be a (CH2)2O group. Let's calculate: (12*2)+(4*1)+16=24+4+16=44. Close but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group? Or another combination.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene, but that's probably more advanced.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group. CH2CH2O is C2H4O, which has a molecular weight of 44 (24 +4 +16=44). Hmm, but the peak is at 45. Close. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment at m/z=45 could be (CH3CO), which is 43 (12*2 +3 +12 +16= 43? Wait, (CH3)CO is 43 (12*2 +3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Close to 45, but not quite. Alternatively, perhaps a fragment like (CH2CH2O), which would be 44. Still not 45.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a (CO) group attached to something. Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible structures of the options.

Option C is C6H10O2. Possible structures: esters, which have a carbonyl and an ether oxygen. For example, methyl propionate is an ester with formula C4H8O2. Another possibility is a diester, but for C6H10O2, perhaps something like methyl cyclopropenoate? Or maybe a substituted ester with a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that would have a ring and a carbonyl. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

Another approach: think about the possible structures of the options.

Option B: C6H10O. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, one oxygen. Could be an alcohol with a double bond. For example, cyclopentene methanol. But the IR would have an O-H stretch (broad) and a carbonyl? Wait, no, because option B is only C6H10O. So if it's an alcohol with a double bond, the IR would show O-H (broad) and C=C (around 1650). But the FTIR also shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. So that's a problem because option B (C6H10O) doesn't have a carbonyl group. Because the formula only has one O. So that can't be. So perhaps that's ruled out.

Wait, but wait: the FTIR shows a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group. So the compound must have a carbonyl. Therefore, options B (C6H10O) and D (C6H12O) have only one O, so the carbonyl would require another O, unless it's something else. Wait, no: a ketone has a carbonyl (C=O), which requires an O. So if the compound has a ketone, it would have one O. But wait, the IR here has a broad O-H as well. So if the compound has both a ketone and an -OH group, that would require two O's. So the formula would need two O's. Let me see the options.

Looking back:

Option A: C6H12O2 → two O's.

Option C: C6H10O2 → two O's.

Options B and D: one O each.

So, if the compound has both a ketone (C=O) and an -OH group, that would require two O's. Thus, the formula must be either A or C.

So now, options are A and C.

So the FTIR shows a broad O-H (like from an alcohol or carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl. So if the formula is A or C.

But the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So which of these would have a fragment of 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is 6*12 +12 + 32 = 72 +12 +32=116.

So a fragment of 45 would be about 39% of the molecule. Possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114. So a fragment of 45 is about 40% of the molecule.

Hmm. Let's think about the structure of each possibility.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possibilities include esters, like methyl pentanoate or something else. But also could be a cyclic ester (lactone). But with a vinyl group, so perhaps a structure with a double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation: 1 (from DoU calculation earlier). So either a ring or a double bond.

But to have a double bond, DoU would be 1. But the IR has both C=O and C=C? Wait, no, because for option A, DoU is 1. So it can only have one double bond (either C=O or C=C). But the IR has two peaks: 1700 (C=O) and 1650 (maybe C=C). So that would require two double bonds, which would make DoU=2. But option A only has DoU=1. Therefore, that can't be. So option A is out.

So that leaves option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So that can have two double bonds, perhaps a C=O and a C=C.

So structure could be an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2... Wait, let me think. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted ester with a double bond.

So, the IR shows both C=O and C=C. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the double bond is present. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

So, thinking about the mass spec: the fragment at 45. Let's imagine the structure. Suppose the compound is an ester with a vinyl group.

For example, maybe it's something like methyl vinyl benzoate, but that's probably not fitting. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another approach. A common fragment at m/z=45 is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. No. Alternatively, the fragment could be (CH2)2CO, which would be 43. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks off a methyl group or an ethyl group. For example, if the molecular ion is at m/z=114 (for option C), losing a fragment of 69 would give 45. Or perhaps losing a fragment of 69 (which is 114-45=69). Wait, 69 is a possible fragment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be the result of losing a larger group, like the ester group. Let's say the molecule is an ester with a double bond. The ester group is OCOOR. If the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, perhaps fragmenting into an alkyl group and a carbonyl group. Let's see.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The possibilities could be an ester with a double bond, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Its molecular formula is C4H6O2. But option C is C6H10O2, so perhaps a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond? But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mass spec fragment is the acylium ion. The acylium ion has a formula of RCO+, which would have a molecular weight of (R's weight + 12 +16). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, which is (R2C=C=O)+, but I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecule is an ester with a substituent that can break off. Suppose the structure is something like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's more carbons than our formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that adds up to more than six carbons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is cyclohexene with an ester group. Or maybe it's a substituted ester. Another thought: if the molecule is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOOR, where R is something.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible structures. The compound has a double bond and an ester group. The ester group is O-CO-O. Wait, no, ester is RCOOR'. So, the structure would be RCOOR' where R and R' are alkyl or alkenyl groups.

If the ester has a vinyl group, perhaps the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, leading to a lower wavenumber for the C=O (like around 1700 cm^-1, but maybe a bit lower due to conjugation).

So, the IR has two peaks: 1700 and 1650. 1700 is the C=O, and 1650 is the C=C. So that fits with an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which would be split into a certain pattern, maybe a doublet or triplet depending on substitution.

Now, the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let me think about the possible losses.

In esters, a common fragment is the loss of the R' group as an alcohol. For example, in methyl esters, losing the methyl group as CH3O+ (which would be 31?), but that's not 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, the ester group (O-CO-O) might break, leaving behind a fragment.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, that's (CH2=CHCOO) and (CH2CH2CH3). But CH2=CHCOO is C3H4O2, and the ester would be C3H4O2 * C3H7O? Wait, perhaps not. Let's calculate the molecular formula.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: that's 3 carbons from CH2=CHCOO and 3 from CH2CH2CH3. So total 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2. Yes. So molecular weight is 6*12 +10*1 + 32 = 72 +10 +32=114.

So, the molecular ion would be at 114. What fragments could form?

When the ester breaks, it could lose the R' group (CH2CH2CH3) as an alcohol, which would be 58 (since CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7, and the loss would be as CH2CH2CH2OH, which is 58. But wait, 58 is higher than 45. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into two smaller parts.

Another possibility is that the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, leading to a fragment with the acyl group and another with the alkyl group. For example, in CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, the ester could break into CH2=CHCOO- and CH2CH2CH3.

But the molecular weight of CH2=CHCOO- is (3*12) + (4*1) + (2*16) = 36 +4 +32=72. That's higher than
