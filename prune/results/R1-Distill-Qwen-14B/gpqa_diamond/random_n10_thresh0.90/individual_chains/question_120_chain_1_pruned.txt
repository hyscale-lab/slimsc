Okay, let me try to figure out this question. So, the question is about the distribution of stars in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that distance is inversely proportional to parallax, like d = 1/plx, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact units here. Oh right, in parsecs, so d = 1/plx where plx is in arcseconds.

Now, stars are uniformly distributed in space, but wait the question says they are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, no, wait, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Hmm, does that mean uniformly distributed in terms of their actual positions in space, or does it mean something else? Or perhaps it's a different way of looking at it. Wait, no, the initial setup says stars are uniformly distributed, so perhaps it's in the 3D space, so their number density is uniform. Oh wait, but the way the question is phrased is, how does the number per unit plx range change with plx. So I think we're looking at the distribution of parallax values, not the distribution of stars in space. Or maybe it's about the count of stars observed with certain parallax ranges.

Wait, let me think. The number of stars we observe with a certain parallax depends on both their actual distribution and how their distances translate into parallax. So, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, their density is the same everywhere, but when we calculate how many are within a certain distance range, that depends on the volume. Oh wait, but in this problem, the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which I'm now confused about. Wait, the question says "stars are uniformly distributed in the sky." Wait, but the sky is a 2D sphere around us. So perhaps it's saying that the stars are spread uniformly on the celestial sphere. Or does it mean that their positions in space are such that their distribution in the sky (as seen from Earth) is uniform?

Wait, maybe I should clarify. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number per unit volume is constant. But when observed from Earth, their apparent distribution on the sky (the celestial sphere) would also be uniform because of isotropy in the universe. So perhaps the question is assuming that stars are uniformly distributed in space, leading to a certain distribution of parallax.

Wait, the question says the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So perhaps that means their density on the celestial sphere is uniform. But parallax depends on distance, so we'd have to think about how the number of stars at a certain distance relates to their parallax.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the density of stars as a function of distance, and how that translates into the distribution of parallax. Let's try to model this.

Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d (in parsecs). So if a star is at distance d, its parallax is plx = 1/d. So as d increases, plx decreases.

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd is proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness
