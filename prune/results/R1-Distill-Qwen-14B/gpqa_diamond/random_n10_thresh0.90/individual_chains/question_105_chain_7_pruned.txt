Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of it. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. The setup is that these spots cause the star's brightness to vary as the star rotates, which is similar to how an exoplanet transiting in front would cause a dip in brightness. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) in the star's light curve as these spots do.

Wait, no—the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)" what would be the exoplanet's radius relative to the star.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. So, the star's spots are causing a certain dip in brightness as it rotates, but if instead, an exoplanet were transiting, what size planet would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do? So, they are comparing two scenarios: one where the star has spots, and another where a planet transits. The brightness dip from both should have the same amplitude, and we need to find the planet's radius.

But wait, the star has spots on one hemisphere. So when it rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing a dip in brightness. But for a planet, it's a transit where the planet blocks some of the star's light. So the dip in brightness depends on the area of the spot or the planet's disk relative to the star's disk.

Let me think about how the brightness variation works. For the star with spots, the brightness change comes from the spots being cooler. When the spots are facing us (as the star rotates), the total brightness observed is lower because the spots are emitting less light. The amplitude is the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness.

But wait, the question says the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Let's say Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the total area of the spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) = 0.1 π Rstar².

But wait, when the star rotates, we see either the spotted hemisphere or the non-spotted one. So the net change in brightness would be based on the difference between the star's brightness when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, no, actually, as the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the brightness goes down when the spots are visible, and returns to normal when they're not. The dip's amplitude is the difference between the normal brightness and the brightness with the spots.

But the spots are cooler. So each spot emits less flux than
