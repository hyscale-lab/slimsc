Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... so I remember that at speeds comparable to the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we need to apply Einstein's theory of relativity.

Let me read the problem again carefully. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. So both are moving in the same direction. Wait, but the question is about their relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. You can't say it's 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c because that's what you'd do classically, but relativity has a different formula for relative velocity.

I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. If two objects are moving at u and v relative to a rest frame, their relative speed isn't simply u - v. The correct formula, I think, is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So we can plug in u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c.

Let me calculate that. So the numerator would be 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that denominator. 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3. So 0.3 c² divided by c² is 0.3. Then 1 - 0.3 is 0.7. So the denominator is 0.7. So relative velocity is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Which is approximately 0.14c when rounded, or 0.14c. So the relative velocity is about 0.14c. That seems right.

Wait, looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So either C or D is the right one. Let me check the other part, the total energy.

The total energy of the system. So each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So for each, we calculate gamma for their speed and multiply by their mass, then add them together.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v² is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36c². So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Square root of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1 / 0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m c² * mass. Wait, wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. So v² is (0.5c)^2 = 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 is 0.75. Square root is about 0.8660. So gamma is 1/(sqrt(0.75)) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding the two energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 m c². Hmm, that's approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B has E=4.96, which doesn't match. So option C seems to fit for both the relative speed and the energy.

Wait, but wait a second. What's the correct way to calculate the total energy? Is it the sum of the energies of each astronaut? Because each is moving, so their energies are each their rest mass energy times gamma. So yeah, adding E1 and E2 should be correct.

But another thought: the system's total energy. The system comprises both astronauts. So yes, their energies add. So 2.5 + 3.464 = ~5.964, so E is about 5.96 mc^2.

So looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the options using "m" as the rest mass, or as something else? Let me make sure. The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, so yes, each's rest mass is 2m and 3m. So their energies are correctly calculated as 2m * gamma and 3m * gamma.

So the conclusion is that option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 - \frac{0.3c^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
\]

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

So, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
For the first astronaut with mass \( 2m \) and speed \( 0.6c \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
For the second astronaut with mass \( 3m \) and speed \( 0.5c \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations, the relative speed is \( 0.14c \) and the total energy is \( 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96mc^2 \)**
