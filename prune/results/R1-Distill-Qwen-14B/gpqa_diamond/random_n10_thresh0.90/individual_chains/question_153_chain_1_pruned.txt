Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry reactions, specifically the Michael addition. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each producing a product. Then there are options A to D, each providing possible products for each part. I need to figure out which option correctly gives the products.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The Michael addition typically involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester and can form an enolate. The enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate. In this case, the acrylate has a substituent at the beta position, which is the p-tolyl group.

So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH₂=CH-p-tolyl, but wait, wait. Let me get the structure right. The acrylate is CH₂=CH- attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait no, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CO-OCH3 with the CH₂=CH- group having the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. The molecule is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate is CH₂=CH- with the ester group. So the structure is probably CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent at the beta carbon. Wait, or is the substituent on the alpha?

Wait, the IUPAC name is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO−. So the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, acrylate is CH₂=CH- attached to COOCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl group is on the third carbon, but the acrylate has two carbons: CH₂=CH–COOCH3. So the numbering is 1, 2, 3? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the acrylate has the double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is CH₂=CH–COOCH3. So the 3-position is the carbonyl carbon. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the p-tolyl is on the carbonyl group? No, that can't be because acrylates are CH₂=CHCOOR. So maybe the substituent is on the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂=CH–COOCH3, and the p-tolyl is on the double bond. So the molecule is CH₂–C(p-tolyl)=CH–COOCH3? No, wait. Or perhaps it's CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH₂–C(p-tolyl)=
