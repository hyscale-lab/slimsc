Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, brighter means lower numbers, right? So if a star's V mag is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So it's easier for HIRES because the limit is lower (brighter stars).

Each star has different properties. I need to calculate their apparent V magnitudes to see if both spectrographs can detect them.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Since it's at 10 pc, the apparent magnitude equals the absolute magnitude. So V =15.5. Now, check the limits.

ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag, so 15.5 is okay. HIRES can see up to 16 mag, so 15.5 is also okay. So Star1 is detectable by both. Wait, but let me make sure. So Star1 is within both limits, so yes.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. So for ESPRESSO, 16.5 is less than 17, so it's okay. But HIRES requires brighter than 16.5? Wait, the limit is brighter than 16.5? No, the limit is stars with V mag brighter than 16 mag. So if a star is V=16.5, that's dimmer than 16. So HIRES can't see it. Because 16.5 is higher than 16, meaning it's fainter. So Star2 can't be seen by HIRES. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction. E(B-V) is 0.6, and the extinction in V band is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the intrinsic apparent mag is 15.5, but the observed (or what we see from Earth) is brighter? Wait, no. Wait, extinction makes stars appear dimmer, so the observed apparent magnitude without extinction is lower. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula is: apparent magnitude without extinction (m0) is m_observed = m0 + A_V. So if the observed is 15.5, and A_V is 1.86, then m0 = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. Wait, but that's not right. Because when there's extinction, the star appears dimmer. So the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be lower (brighter) than the observed.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Extinction (interstellar dust) makes stars appear dimmer, so their apparent magnitude increases. So if the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs, the true m0 is m_obs - A_V. Because m0 is what the magnitude would be without extinction. So if you have a star with m0 = 13, and A_V = 2, then m_obs =15. So in Star3's case, the given apparent V is 15.5. So the intrinsic (without extinction) would be 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, no, that's not correct. Because extinction adds to the magnitude. So if the star's light is absorbed, the apparent magnitude increases (since it's dimmer). So the observed m = m0 + A_V.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula correctly. The star's true apparent magnitude would be m0, and the observed is m_obs = m0 + A_V. So if the observed is 15.5, then m0 = 15.5 - A_V = 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. So the star without extinction would have an apparent mag of 13.64. But in our case, the observed is 15.5, which includes the extinction. Wait, no, the question says Star3 has apparent V mag of 15.5. So that's the observed value, already including extinction. Because E(B-V) is given, and the problem says to compute total absorption. So the observed m is 15.5. So the star is dimmer than it would be without extinction.

Wait, but the question is about what the telescopes can observe. The telescopes are on Earth, so they see the star with extinction already applied. So for each star, the apparent magnitude as seen from Earth is what matters.

So Star3 has an apparent V of 15.5. So for ESPRESSO, which detects up to 17 mag, that's okay. For HIRES, which is brighter than 16, 15.5 is okay. So Star3 is detectable by both. Wait, no, but wait: the apparent V mag is 15.5. So both can detect it.

Star4: Absolute V is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc. So first, calculate the apparent V mag without extinction. Since absolute magnitude M is 15.5 and distance is 10 pc, then m0 (apparent mag without extinction) is 15.5. Then add the extinction. A_V=3.1 * 0.4=1.24. So m_obs = m0 + A_V =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, but wait. No, the absolute magnitude is M, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if the star is at 10 pc, then its apparent magnitude without extinction is M. Then adding extinction gives the observed m.

Wait, but in Star4's case, it's located at 10 pc, so without extinction, m0 is 15.5. Then, with extinction, m_obs would be 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

So for Star4, observed V is 16.74.

Now, check against the spectrograph limits.

ESPRESSO can go up to V=17. So 16.74 is less than 17, okay.

HIRES can go up to V=16. So 16.74 is higher than 16, which means the star is fainter than HIRES can detect. So HIRES can't see it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star5: Absolute V mag is 16.5, distance 5pc. So calculate its apparent mag without extinction. M=16.5, distance d=5pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M +5 log10(d/10). So d/10 = 0.5, log(0.5)= -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010)= -1.505. So m0 =16.5 + (-1.505) =14.995 ~15.0.

But wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5. So when it's at 5 pc, m0 = M + 5 log(d/10) → 16.5 +5 log(0.5) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) →16.5 -1.505=14.995, yeah. So m0 is about 15.0.

But what about extinction? Star5's
