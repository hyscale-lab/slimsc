Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the question says that two quantum states have energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find out which energy difference between them would allow us to clearly distinguish the two levels.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with the energy and lifetime of particles. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! It states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like energy and time, can be known simultaneously.

The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the uncertainty in energy and Δt is the uncertainty in time (or the lifetime in this case). Wait, but sometimes the equation is written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, which is the principle itself. ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s.

So, the idea is that the product of the energy uncertainty and the time (lifetime) must be at least ħ/2. If the energy difference between the two states is too small, the uncertainty in measuring it might be larger than the actual difference, making it hard to distinguish the two energy levels.

The question is asking which energy difference would allow clear resolution. So, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty given by ħ divided by the lifetime. Because if ΔE is larger than the uncertainty, we can measure it distinctly.

Wait, let me think about the lifetimes. The first state has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds, and the second 10^-8 seconds. So their uncertainties would be different. Which one do I use?

Ah, because the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So, the energy difference ΔE is |E2 - E1|. To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But wait, each state has its own uncertainty. But perhaps we're considering the system's lifetime as the longer one or the shorter one. Hmm.

Wait, no, I think each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in the energy of each state is based on their own lifetime. But when considering the energy difference between the two, maybe we should use the minimum uncertainty between them. Because if one has a longer lifetime (lower uncertainty) and the other a shorter (higher uncertainty), the overall uncertainty in the energy difference might be based on the shorter lifetime.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's think, the energy of each state is uncertain. For the first state with τ1 =1e-9 s, ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2). The energy difference ΔE would be E2 - E1. To resolve them, the actual ΔE must be greater than the combined uncertainty of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Wait, but how do you combine the uncertainties? Since ΔE1 and ΔE2 are the uncertainties in each individual energy, the uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), because when you subtract two quantities, their uncertainties add quadratically.

Alternatively, if τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes, which are the uncertainties in time, then perhaps the uncertainty in energy for each is ħ/(2τ), so the uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt( (ħ/(2τ1))^2 + (ħ/(2τ2))^2 ).

But wait, the question is about whether the energy difference is large enough to be resolved. So the actual ΔE should be larger than this combined uncertainty.

Wait, but let me think about it another way. If each state's energy is known to within ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the minimal detectable difference in energy between the two would be about the sum of their uncertainties. Or perhaps it's the larger of the two uncertainties, because the system can't have a resolution better than the worst case.

Alternatively, perhaps the uncertainty in the energy difference is determined by the smaller of the two lifetimes, because if one state has a shorter lifetime (higher energy uncertainty), then the energy difference's uncertainty would be dominated by that.

Wait, let's compute the individual energy uncertainties.

Compute ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

Given τ1 =
