Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Let me think about what I remember from my astronomy classes.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So a star with a smaller parallax is farther away. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if plx increases, the star is closer, and if plx decreases, the star is farther.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—does that mean their density is uniform, so the number density is constant? Or does it mean something else? Oh wait, if they’re uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume doesn't depend on where you look. So the number of stars per unit volume is the same everywhere.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So maybe I need to relate the number of stars in a certain range of parallax to the actual volume they occupy.

Parallax relates to distance. So for a star to have a parallax between plx and plx + dplx, their distance would be between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx, and dd would be the change in distance. Let me try to express that.

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by dplx, d changes by dd. Let me compute dd in terms of dplx. Taking derivative, d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to get into calculus here.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the number density of stars. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4π d² dd. Since the number density (n) is constant, the number of stars dN would be n * 4π d² dd.

But how does this relate to parallax? Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the expression for dN.

dN = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * dd. Wait, but what is dd in terms
