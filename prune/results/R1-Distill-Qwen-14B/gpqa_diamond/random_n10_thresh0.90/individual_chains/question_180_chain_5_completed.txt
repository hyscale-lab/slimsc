Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says we've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, which I know is twice the elementary charge. Their mass is negligible, so maybe we don't have to worry about kinetic energy or something. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when you have charges in a system, their potential energy contributes to the total energy. Since all the charges are the same, perhaps I can model this as point charges arranged in some way.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P, which is where the 13th charge is located.

So, the system has two parts: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the other 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P, but how are they arranged? Are they all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m? So, each is 2m from P, but their mutual distances would depend on their arrangement. Hmm, but this might complicate things. Because the mutual potential energy between each pair would depend on their positions relative to each other.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So, perhaps all 12 are at a single point 2m away? But that can't be, because then they'd be on top of each other, which is impossible since they're identical charges and would repel. But maybe in this problem, the mutual potential energy is considered because they're all at the same point, but that doesn't make much sense physically. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is negligible because they're all fixed at the same distance from P, such that their mutual distances are zero? Wait, that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps the setup is that the 12 charges are equally spaced on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, so each is 2m from P. But then, the mutual distances between the 12 would vary, but calculating all those interactions would be complicated. But the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so maybe we can find an arrangement where the mutual potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but the problem states it's an isolated system, so the total energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since the system is isolated, maybe the energy is just the potential energy between the charges—since kinetic energy isn't considered here because the particles are constrained, perhaps.

Wait, no, in the case of an isolated system, the total energy is the sum of all the potential energies. Because the problem mentions that the charges have negligible mass, so perhaps we're only considering electrostatic potential energy.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of two parts: the potential energy between the fixed charge at P and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but the problem says all 12 are at 2m from P. So, each of the 12 is at distance r = 2m from P. The 13th charge is at P.

So, each of the 12 charges is a distance r = 2 m from the 13th charge. So, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is U1 = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Since q1 is 2e and q2 is also 2e, each of these interactions would contribute that amount.

Wait, but how many such interactions are there? The 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, so that's 12 interactions. So, U1 = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m).

But wait, let me think again. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 q2) / r. So for each of the 12 charges, the contribution is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) ), right? So 12 times that.

Then, we also have the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Since all the 12 are at a distance of 2m from P, what is the distance between any two of them? Hmm, that's the thing. If they're all at the same point at 2m from P, then the distance between any two would be zero, but that's not possible because they are point charges and would repel. So, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are 2m as well? No, that doesn't make sense because for a sphere, the 12 charges on a sphere would be at radius 2m, but their mutual distances would be less than 4m (the diameter), but more than zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's not possible because like charges can't be at the same point due to repulsion. So perhaps the problem is simplifying the situation and only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and neglecting the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Because maybe the mutual potential energy is either negligible or perhaps the problem is considering only the interactions with the fixed charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering an arrangement where the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is minimized. Wait, but I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's read the question again. It says "the 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So, all 12 are at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances could be anything, as long as each is 2m from P. So, the mutual distances between the 12 could vary, but perhaps the minimum total potential energy occurs when the mutual potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but wait, potential energy between two positive charges is positive, and it's given by U = k q1 q2 / r. So, for the 12 charges, each pair contributes U = k (2e)(2e) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and charge j.

To minimize the total potential energy, we'd want to maximize r_ij for each pair, because that would make each term as small as possible. Because U is positive, so making r_ij larger would make each U smaller, thus lowering the total.

But wait, if each of the 12 charges is at 2 m from P, what is the maximum possible distance between any two of them? Well, if all 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, the maximum possible distance between any two would be 4m (diameter). But arranging all 12 on a sphere so that each is as far as possible from each other would require a specific configuration. For example, placing them at the vertices of a regular polyhedron inscribed in the sphere. But perhaps the minimum potential energy occurs when the mutual distances are as large as possible. However, calculating all those distances and summing their contributions would be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplifying and ignoring the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges because it's considered negligible. Or perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero, which doesn't make sense because they're all at the same point, but that would mean infinite repulsion.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2m away from P. So, all 12 are coinciding at a single point. But that's impossible because like charges would repel. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Because if you don't consider that, the problem becomes simpler.

Wait, that's possible. Let me check the options. The options are A to D, with some very small numbers and a much larger number. Let me think about the magnitude.

The charges are 2e each, so 2 * 1.6e-19 C = 3.2e-19 C each.

The distance from P is 2m.

So, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is:

U1 = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) = k * (4 e^2) / (2) = 2k e^2 / 1.

But wait, k is Coulomb's constant, which is about 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So, plugging in the numbers:

Each pair between the 13th and the others contributes (8.988e9) * ( (2e)^2 ) / 2m.

Wait, but wait, let's compute each term.

Each U between the 13th and a charge is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So, for each of the 12 charges, the U is 2 k e², so the total U1 is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let's compute that.

But wait, what's the value of e²? e is 1.6e-19 C, so e² is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 24 * k * e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38:

8.988e9 is about 9e9, and 2.56e-38 is about 2.56e-38. Multiplying them gives approximately (9e9) * (2.56e-38) = 23.04e-29 = 2.304e-28.

Then multiply by 24:

24 * 2.304e-28 = 55.296e-28 = 5.5296e-27 J.

Wait, but that's just the contribution from the 13th charge and the 12. But wait, I'm not considering the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. If the mutual potential energy isn't considered, then that's the total. But if it is considered, it would add more energy.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. So, if the mutual potential energy is positive, adding it would increase the total energy. So, perhaps the minimum energy occurs when the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's impossible because they're all at the same point.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible, thus making each term as small as possible (since U is proportional to 1/r). But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 charges and not the mutual terms.

Wait, another possibility: The problem is considering the entire system as consisting of the 13th charge and 12 others, each at 2m from P. But in reality, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is part of the system's energy. But calculating that would require knowing their mutual distances. Since the problem states it's an isolated system, the mutual potential energy must be included.

But maybe because the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are variable, the minimum energy is achieved when the mutual potential energy is at its minimum (most negative?), but wait, since all charges are positive, the mutual potential energy is positive, so the minimum would be when it's as small as possible, i.e., when the charges are as far apart as possible.

But without knowing the arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, which would be a mistake, but perhaps it's intended.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being neglected, which is an approximation. Maybe the question expects us to only calculate the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12 others.

So, in that case, the total potential energy would be 24 * k e².

Wait, let me recalculate that.

Each of the 12 charges contributes k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*4e²/(2) = 2k e².

So, 12 charges: 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Compute 24 * k * e²:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e = 1.6e-19 C, so e² = 2.56e-38 C².

24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = let's compute step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = ?

8.988e9 is approximately 8.988 x 1e9.
2.56e-38 is 2.56 x 1e-38.

Multiplying them: 8.988 * 2.56 ≈ 23.04, and 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 23.04e-29 = 2.304e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.304e-28 = 55.296e-28 = 5.5296e-27 J.

But wait, that's the U1, the potential energy between the 13th and the 12.

Now, consider the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between two charges.

But since all 12 are at the same distance from P (2m), their mutual distances can vary, but for simplicity, perhaps the problem is assuming that they are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is zero or minimized in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the problem neglects it, which would make the total energy just U1.

But the options given don't include 5.5e-27. Let me look at the options.

Options are:

A) 5.645e-26

B) 2.822e-26

C) 7.056e-27

D) 122.330

Wait, 5.53e-27 is approximately 5.5e-27, which is close to option C) 7.056e-27? No, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the U1.

Each U between the 13th and a charge at 2m:

U = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) 

Which is (k * 4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So for each charge, 2 k e².

12 charges: 12 * 2 = 24 terms.

So 24 * k e².

Compute 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, e² is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38 = ?

8.988 * 2.56 ≈ let's compute that:

8 * 2.56 = 20.48, 0.988 * 2.56 ≈ 2.526. So total ≈ 20.48 + 2.526 ≈ 23.006.

So 23.006e9-38 = 2.3006e-28.

Now multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3006e-28 = 55.2144e-28 = 5.52144e-27 J.

So that's about 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27, which is a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 8.988e9 * 2.56e-38.

8.988e9 is 8.988 × 1e9.

2.56e-38 is 2.56 × 1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 2.56.

Compute 8 * 2.56 = 20.48.

0.988 * 2.56: Let's compute 1 * 2.56 = 2.56. Subtract 0.012 * 2.56 (since 0.988 is 1 - 0.012).

0.012 * 2.56 = 0.03072.

So 2.56 - 0.03072 = 2.52928.

So total is 20.48 + 2.52928 = 23.00928.

So 23.00928 × 1e9 × 1e-38 = 23.00928 × 1e-29 = 2.300928e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 × 2.300928e-28 = 55.222272e-28 = 5.5222272e-27 J.

Hmm, again, about 5.52e-27 J.

But none of the options match that. The closest option would be option C) 7.056e-27, which is higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as relative to infinity, so perhaps each pair between the 12 charges contributes energy, but perhaps that's negligible, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are arranged in a way that the sum of their mutual potential energies is also computed.

But this seems complicated, but perhaps the problem is more straightforward than that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at point P, but that can't be because they're placed at 2m from P. So, perhaps the setup is that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are zero, which isn't possible. Alternatively, the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered as zero, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the question is suggesting.

Wait, I think perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the total potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So, the system has 13 charges: 1 at P, and 12 at 2m from P.

The potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 12 * [ (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ].

Which is 12 * [ (k *4 e²) / 2 ] = 12 * [ 2 k e² ] = 24 k e².

Then, the potential energy between each of the 12 charges themselves: each pair contributes (k * (2e) * (2e) ) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between them.

But without knowing r_ij, it's hard to calculate. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not possible because the charges are the same sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and ignoring the mutual part.

But then the total would be 24 k e² = approximately 5.5e-27 J, which isn't an option. But looking at the options, the closest is option C) 7.056e-27, but that's higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, in the initial calculation, I computed 24 * k * e² as 5.5e-27 J. But perhaps the actual value is different.

Let me compute 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute step by step:

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.56e-38 * 8.988e9 = ?

2.56 * 8.988 ≈ 23.006.

Exponents: 1e-38 * 1e9 = 1e-29.

So 23.006e-29 = 2.3006e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3006e-28 = 55.2144e-28 = 5.52144e-27 J.

So about 5.52e-27 J.

Looking at the options, none of them match that. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2m from P, so the distance between any two is zero, which would make their mutual potential energy infinite, but that's not possible, so perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and not the mutual part.

In that case, the energy would be 24 * k e², which is 5.52e-27 J.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem says the 12 are at 2m from P, but the 13th is at P, which is at the same location as one of the other charges? No, because the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are 2m away.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute using precise values.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

So e^2 = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approximately 2.56697e-38 C².

So, U1 = 24 * k * e².

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.56697e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.56697e-38:

8.988e9 = 8.988 × 1e9.

2.56697e-38 = 2.56697 × 1e-38.

Multiply the coefficients: 8.988 * 2.56697 ≈ Let me compute that.

8 * 2.56697 = 20.53576.

0.988 * 2.56697 ≈ Let me compute:

2.56697 * 0.988 = approximately 2.56697 * 1 is 2.56697. Subtract 2.56697 * 0.012 = 0.03080364. So 2.56697 - 0.03080364 ≈ 2.53616636.

So total is 20.53576 + 2.53616636 ≈ 23.071926.

So, 23.071926e-29 = 2.3071926e-28.

Multiply by 24: 24 * 2.3071926e-28 = 55.3726224e-28 = 5.53726224e-27 J.

Which is approximately 5.537e-27 J.

Looking again at the options, I don't see that. The closest is option C) 7.056e-27, which is about 1.5 times larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 4 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. The problem says the 12 are at 2m from P. So each is 2m from P. The 13th is at P.

So, the distance between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2m.

Wait, but when I calculated U1, I considered each pair as (k*(2e)^2)/2m, which is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the energy to be calculated using potential energy per unit charge or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor in the number of interactions.

Wait, another possibility: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is 12*(k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which is correct. But the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is another term. How many pairs are there among 12 charges? It's (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs. Each pair contributes k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is their separation.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 are at the same distance from each other as from P, which would be 2m. That can't be because, for a regular dodecahedron or something, the distances would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged on a sphere such that each is 2m from P, and their mutual distances are all equal to 2m. But that's impossible because arranging 12 points on a sphere so that each pair is 2m apart would require the sphere's radius to be such that the chord length is 2m. The chord length c is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle subtended at the center. But 2m chord length and radius r=2m would imply c = 2*2m*sin(theta/2), so 2m = 4m sin(theta/2), which implies sin(theta/2) = 0.5 → theta/2 = 30 degrees → theta=60 degrees. So each pair would be 60 degrees apart on the sphere. But can you arrange 12 points on a sphere with each pair 60 degrees apart? I'm not sure. But perhaps that's an assumption the problem is making.

If that's the case, then r_ij = 2m. So each mutual pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2/(2m).

So, the mutual potential energy would be 66 * [k*(4e^2)/(2m)] = 66 * [2 k e²] = 132 k e².

So the total potential energy would be U1 + U2 = 24 k e² + 132 k e² = 156 k e².

Compute 156 * 8.988e9 * 2.56697e-38.

Wait, but 156 is a lot. Let's see:

156 * 8.988e9 = approximately 156 * 9e9 = 1.404e12.

Multiply by 2.56697e-38: 1.404e12 * 2.56697e-38 = approx 3.613e-26 J.

Wait, that's 3.613e-26 J, which is about 3.6e-26, but that's not one of the options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered as non-zero, but with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual potential energy is zero. But that's not possible because they're all positive.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another approach.

Another approach: The system's potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So, for each pair of charges, calculate their potential energy and sum them all.

In this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So, the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, giving 12 terms.

The 12 charges themselves have mutual interactions, which are (12 choose 2)=66 terms.

But without knowing the exact distances between these 12 charges, it's impossible to compute the exact potential energy. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distances are at maximum, which would minimize the potential energy (since U is positive and smaller for larger r).

Wait, but even so, without knowing how the 12 are arranged, we can't compute the exact value. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, and only consider the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others.

In that case, the total energy would be U = 24 k e² ≈ 5.53e-27 J.

But that's not one of the options. The options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Wait, C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.28 times higher than my calculated 5.53e-27.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Let me recheck.

Wait, the 13th charge is at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m from P. So the number of interactions between the 13th and the 12 is 12, each contributing U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (k*4e²)/2 = 2 k e².

So U1 = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2 because each pair is counted twice. Wait no, in the way I computed it, each pair is considered once. Because the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 interactions. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like using electric potential and charge multiplied by potential, but that's the same approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the electric potential at point P due to the 12 charges, then multiplying by the charge at P. Because the potential at P due to each of the 12 charges is V = k*(2e)/(2m) = k e / m. So the total potential at P is 12 * (k e)/(2m) = (12 k e)/(2m) = 6 k e / m. Then, the potential energy is q * V = (2e) * (6 k e / m). Let me compute that.

So U = 2e * (6 k e / 2m) ) Wait, no: the potential at P is V = (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)/(2m) for each charge. So 12 charges contribute 12 * (k*(2e))/(2m) ) = (12 k e) / m.

Then, the potential energy is the charge at P (2e) multiplied by this potential: U = (2e) * (12 k e / m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, wait, no. The potential at P due to each of the 12 charges is V_i = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/m. So total V = 12*(k e/m) = 12k e/m.

The charge at P is 2e, so the potential energy is q * V = 2e * (12 k e/m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, but that's the same as what I had before, because 24 k e² is 24 k e² / 1, since m is 2 meters, but wait no, I think I messed up somewhere.

Wait, no. The distance is 2m, so V_i = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/m.

So total V = 12 * (k e / m) = (12 k e) / m.

Then, the potential energy U = q * V = (2e) * (12 k e / m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, the U1 was 24 k e², without dividing by m. So where is the m here?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between meters and something else. Let's compute this correctly.

Each charge is at 2m from P. So, the potential at P due to one charge is V = k*(2e)/(2m) = (k e)/(m).

So, for 12 charges, V_total = 12 * (k e/m) = (12 k e) / m.

The charge at P is 2e, so U = (2e) * (12 k e)/(m) = (24 k e²) / m.

Now, m is 2 meters, so U = 24 k e² / (2) = 12 k e².

Wait, that's 12 k e².

Let me compute that.

12 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute 12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9 = 1.07856e11.

Multiply by (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So, 1.07856e11 * 2.56e-38 = ?

1.07856e11 * 2.56e-38 = (1.07856 * 2.56) * 1e11-38 = 2.758e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.758e-27 J.

But that's not an option either. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 12 * k * e^2/(2m).

Wait, no, because when I calculated using the potential method, I got U = 12 k e².

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the distance is 2 meters, so perhaps I should use 2m instead of m in the denominator.

Wait, no, because in the potential formula, each charge is at 2m, so the denominator is 2m. Let me redo the potential approach.

Potential at P due to each charge: V_i = (k*(2e)) / (2m) )= (k e)/m.

Total V = 12 * (k e)/m = (12 k e)/m.

Charge at P is 2e, so U = 2e * (12 k e)/m = 24 k e² / m.

But m is 2 meters, so U = 24 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

Compute 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

12 * 8.988e9 = 1.07856e11.

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiply together: 1.07856e11 * 2.56e-38 = 2.758e-27 J.

But again, that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute U. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum over all pairs of their potential energies.

So, the system has 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are each 2m from P.

Each of the 12 charges contributes U with the 13th charge, and with each other.

So, total potential energy U is:

U = U_13 + U_1212.

Where U_13 is the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and U_1212 is the potential energy between the 12 charges among themselves.

Now, U_13 is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = 12*(4 k e^2)/(2m) = 24 k e^2/(2m) = 12 k e^2/m.

Wait, but wait: m is 2 meters. So, U_13 = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) )= 12*(4 k e²)/(2*2) )= 12*(4 k e²)/(4) )= 12 k e².

Wait, that's the same as before.

But what about U_1212? The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

Each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that r_ij is 2m for all pairs, which is not possible. But if we assume that, then U_1212 = (12 choose 2) * (k*(4e²))/(2m) )= 66 * (4 k e²)/(2m) )= 66 * (2 k e²)/m.

So, U_1212 = 132 k e² / m.

Now, U_total = U_13 + U_1212 = 12 k e² + 132 k e² / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters, so 132 k e² / 2 = 66 k e².

So U_total = 12 k e² + 66 k e² = 78 k e².

Compute 78 * (8.988e9) * (1.6e-19)^2.

78 * 8.988e9 = approx 701.8e9 = 7.018e11.

Multiply by (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So, 7.018e11 * 2.56e-38 = approx 1.796e-26 J.

Hmm, which is about 1.8e-26 J. Which is not an option either.

But wait, the options are A: 5.645e-26, B:2.822e-26, C:7.056e-27, D:122.33.

Wait, 1.8e-26 is close to option B (2.8e-26) but not exactly.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps the problem expects us to only consider the potential energy between the 13th and the 12 others, and not the mutual energy between the 12. In that case, U is 12 k e², which is 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Compute 12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9 = 1.07856e11.

Multiply by (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

So 1.07856e11 * 2.56e-38 = approximately 2.757e-27 J.

Which is 2.757e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it precisely.

Compute 12 * (k * (2e)^2) / (2m).

k = 8.988e9, (2e) = 3.2e-19 C.

So (2e)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Wait, wait, no: e is 1.6e-19, so 2e is 3.2e-19, and (2e)^2 is (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

So U = 12 * (8.988e9) * (10.24e-38) / (2*2).

Wait, because the distance is 2m, so denominator is 2.

So, 12 * 8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 / 4.

Compute numerator: 12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9.

Multiply by 10.24e-38: 107.856e9 * 10.24e-38 = (107.856 * 10.24) * 1e-29.

107.856 * 10.24 ≈ 107.856 *10=1078.56, 107.856*0.24≈25.885. So total ≈1104.445.

So 1104.445e-29 = 1.104445e-26.

Divide by 4: (1.104445e-26) /4 ≈ 2.7611125e-27 J.

Which is approximately 2.76e-27 J.

Again, not matching any option.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option B is 2.822e-26 J.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Did I forget to multiply by 10 somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the charge is 2e, which is 3.2e-19 C. So when I calculated (2e)^2, perhaps I should have (1.6e-19 *2)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C², which I did.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem expects the potential energy to be the sum of all the potential energies, including the 13th charge and the 12, and the mutual between the 12.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual potential energy is zero, which isn't correct, but perhaps that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, like U = (3/5) * (k q^2) * (1/r).

Wait, no, that's for a dipole or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th and the 12, and not the mutual terms, so the answer would be approximately 2.76e-27 J, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the problem is considering the potential energy due to the 12 charges at 2m from P, but the 13th is fixed at P, and the mutual potential energy is zero because the 12 are arranged symmetrically, leading to cancellation. But that doesn't make sense because all charges are positive, so the potential energy would still be positive.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying the mutual potential energy between the 12 as zero, and only considering the potential energy between the 13th and the others. So, the total energy is 24 k e², which is 5.53e-27 J. But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the electric potential energy as U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q^2)/(2r), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step, and the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J. Wait, 2.822e-26 is about ten times larger than my calculated 2.76e-27 J. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation.

Where could that factor of 10 come from? Let me check the units.

Wait, no, the distance is 2 meters, so units should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses meters as 2 meters, but if I mistakenly used 2 centimeters, that would introduce a factor of 100 error. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake when computing 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Let me compute 12 * 8.988e9 = 107.856e9.

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiplying 107.856e9 by 2.56e-38 gives:

107.856e9 = 1.07856e11.

1.07856e11 * 2.56e-38 = (1.07856 * 2.56) * 1e11-38.

1.07856 * 2.56 ≈ 2.761.

1e11-38 = 1e-27.

So 2.761e-27 J.

Hmm, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the charges as 2e each, but I computed 2e^2 as 4e², which is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem counts each pair twice, so I should multiply by 2. But that doesn't make sense in this context, as each pair is only counted once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using e as 1.6e-19 C, and 2e as 3.2e-19 C, so (2e)^2 is 10.24e-38, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as 12 * (k * (2e)^2)/(2m) ) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have divided by 2 because each pair is counted twice. Wait, no, because the 13th charge is fixed, so the interactions are one-way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Let me think again: the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12, so 12 interactions. Each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/2m. So U1 is 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2m)) ) = 12 * (2 k e²/m) ) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, but m is 2 meters, so U1 = 24 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

So, 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

Wait, 12 * 8.988e9 = 1.07856e11.

(1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

Multiply: 1.07856e11 * 2.56e-38 = 2.761e-27 J.

Again, same result.

Wait, could the problem be asking for the potential energy per charge or something else? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B)2.822e-26 J, which is about ten times my calculated value. Where would a factor of 10 come from?

Wait, perhaps the distance was 2 cm instead of 2 meters. Let's see.

If the distance was 2 cm = 0.02 m, then the denominator would be 0.02, which is 1e-2 m.

So, in that case, U1 = 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(0.02) ) = 12 * (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2)/(0.02).

Compute (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38.

So 8.988e9 *10.24e-38 = 9.224e-29.

Divide by 0.02: 9.224e-29 / 0.02 = 4.612e-27.

Multiply by 12: 55.344e-27 = 5.5344e-26 J.

Which is approximately 5.53e-26 J. That's close to option A)5.645e-26.

But the problem states the distance is 2 meters, so I think this is not applicable.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier, and the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is about 2.56 times my calculated value of 2.76e-27.

Wait, 2.76e-27 * 2.56 ≈7.05e-27. So perhaps I missed a factor of 2.56.

Wait, where would 2.56 come from? Oh, wait, 2.56 is (1.6)^2, because e is 1.6e-19. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e².

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C, so e² is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C². That's correct.

Another thought: Perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 as (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), which is correct, but I should multiply by 12 and perhaps also by 2 because each pair is considered twice.

Wait, but no, because the 13th is fixed, so each interaction is counted once. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential at P, and the fixed charge contributes to the potential at each of the 12. But that would double count, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy as the work done in assembling the system, which would include bringing each charge from infinity to its position. But that's what I've already considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, such as 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Using k=9e9:

U1 = 12 * (9e9 * (3.2e-19)^2 ) / 2.

So, 3.2e-19 squared is 10.24e-38.

So, 9e9 *10.24e-38 = 9.216e-29.

Divide by 2: 4.608e-29.

Multiply by 12: 55.296e-29 = 5.5296e-28 J.

Wait, that's 5.53e-28 J, which is even smaller than before.

Hmm, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula U = (1/2) * (k q^2)/(r), which would halve the value.

But in that case, my previous U1 would be 2.76e-27 J.

But none of the options match.

At this point, I'm not sure where the mistake is, but perhaps the intended answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of charges. Let me check the problem again.

Problem states 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 are at 2m from P, 13th is fixed at P. So, yes.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes twice the energy, leading to 24 * k e², which is 5.53e-27 J. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the potential energy to be (12 choose 2) * [k (2e)^2 / (2m) ) ], which would be 66 * (4 k e^2)/(2m) )= 66 * 2 k e^2 / m.

But m=2, so 66 * (2 k e^2 ) / 2 = 66 k e^2.

Compute 66 * 8.988e9 * (1.6e-19)^2.

66 * 8.988e9 = 593.748e9 = 5.93748e11.

Multiply by (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38.

5.93748e11 * 2.56e-38 = 1.520e-26 J.

Which is close to option B)2.822e-26, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 in the mutual potential energy. Because each pair contributes U once, but when arranging 12 charges, perhaps each pair is counted twice. No, that's not correct because (12 choose 2) gives each pair once.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the formula U = (3/5) * (k q^2)/(r), but I don't know.

At this point, I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation and the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the value for each option and see which fits.

Option B is 2.822e-26 J.

Compute 2.822e-26 = 28.22e-27.

Compare to my U1 calculation of 2.76e-27 J. So, 28.22e-27 is about 10 times larger.

So, perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the distance. If I used 0.2 meters instead of 2 meters, the denominator would be 0.2, which is a factor of 10 larger. Let me see.

If the distance was 0.2 meters, U1 would be 12 * (8.988e9 * (3.2e-19)^2)/(0.2).

(3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38.

8.988e9 * 10.24e-38 = 9.224e-29.

Divide by 0.2: 4.612e-28.

Multiply by 12: 55.344e-28 = 5.5344e-27 J.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and each of the 12 charges also interacts with the 13th. But that's what I already did.

At this point, I think the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)7.056e-27 J.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should go with option C.


The problem involves calculating the minimum energy of a system of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The total potential energy of the system is the sum of two contributions: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges, and the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Between the 13th Charge and the 12 Charges**:
   - The potential energy between two charges is given by \( U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} \), where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), and \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).
   - Each pair contributes \( U = k \frac{(2e)^2}{2} = 2k e^2 \).
   - There are 12 such interactions, so the total contribution is \( U_1 = 12 \cdot 2k e^2 = 24k e^2 \).

2. **Mutual Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges**:
   - The mutual potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges is \( U = k \frac{(2e)^2}{r_{ij}} \), where \( r_{ij} \) is the distance between two charges.
   - Without knowing the exact arrangement of the 12 charges, it is challenging to compute the exact value of \( r_{ij} \). However, the problem likely assumes that the mutual potential energy is either negligible or minimized, as it does not explicitly provide the arrangement of the 12 charges.

3. **Total Potential Energy**:
   - The total potential energy is the sum of the contributions from the 13th charge and the 12 charges, plus the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.
   - If the mutual potential energy is neglected, the total energy is approximately \( U_{\text{total}} = 24k e^2 \).

4. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Substituting \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), and \( e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
     \[
     U_1 = 24 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.56 \times 10^{-38}) = 5.52 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - This value does not match any of the provided options directly. However, the closest option is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, which is approximately 1.28 times larger than the calculated value.

5. **Consideration of Options**:
   - **Option A (\( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \))**: This is much larger than the calculated value and is inconsistent with the problem setup.
   - **Option B (\( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \))**: This is also larger than the calculated value and does not align with the derived formula.
   - **Option C (\( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \))**: This is the closest to the calculated value and is likely the intended answer.
   - **Option D (\( 122.330 \, \text{J} \))**: This is orders of magnitude larger and unrealistic for the given charges and distances.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable choice, based on the calculations and the provided options, is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**.

Answer: C
