Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, the question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values and see which option matches.

First, let me jot down the given data. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ water. So that will change the concentration. Then we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. 

Wait, so the initial step is dilution. When you mix equal volumes of acid and water, the concentration halves. So the initial concentration after dilution would be 0.025 M, right? Because 0.05 divided by 2 is 0.025.

But wait, actually, the volume is 40 cm³, but when you take 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, the moles are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ water (0.02 L) brings the total volume to 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yes, correct.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is moles / concentration. That would be 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for the equivalence point, I can calculate it, but maybe the second part is easier.

At equivalence point, the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. So the solution will consist of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the solution will be basic. So we can calculate the pH there using the Kb of acetate.

The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, wait, let me compute that exactly: 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is about 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9, which is 5.405e-10.

Now, the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point. The total volume at equivalence is the initial diluted volume (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH used
