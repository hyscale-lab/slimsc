Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out what each reaction produces and match them to the options given.

Starting with reactant A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, so it's the Michael acceptor here.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the acceptor. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-OCH2- something? Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So in this case, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the second carbon. Let me think: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3? Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting
