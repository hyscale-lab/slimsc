Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. So, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is then diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, this diluted solution is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I think I need to find out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Then, figure out how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence, and calculate the pH for those points.

Wait, so the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then it's diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. To find the new concentration, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) / 40 * 0.05? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that correctly.

Wait, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ is 1 mmol. Because 1 L is 1000 cm³, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles, which is 1 mmol.

Then, when you dilute to 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L, the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait, no. No, wait, 1 mmol in 40 cm³ is 0.025 M because 1 mmol is 0.001 mol, and 40 cm³ is 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is 0.1 M. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be equal to moles of CH3COOH initially.

Wait, but wait—the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid is 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 0.025 M is 0.025 mol/L, times 0.04 L is 0.001 mol.

So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But wait, the problem is about when 25% of the equivalence point is reached, and the equivalence point itself.

Wait, 25% titration means 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence is added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

So, first, at 25% titration:

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol.

So when NaOH is added, it reacts with acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of acetate ion will increase by 0.00025.

So after 25% titration:

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- (acetate) = 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total solution volume is initial 40 cm³ plus the added NaOH. So 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ let me compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So, the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.73. Let me confirm: 1e-5 is pKa 5, 1.85 is about 1.85 → log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so pKa is 4.73. Yes.

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.005882)/(0.017647) )

Compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. So log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Hmm, which is approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92; option A is 4.26 and 8.52. Option D's first pH is 4.57, which is higher than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, another thought: maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute the moles and concentrations again.

Wait, initial moles of acetic acid: 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ (0.0025 L) of 0.1 M NaOH: so 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol. So, exactly 25% of the required moles.

So, moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333, which is 1/3.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477. So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253 → around 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So first value is 4.26, which is close to my calculation. So the first pH is about 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate.

So, moles of acetate ion will be 0.001 mol, same as initial acetic acid.

The solution at equivalence point is the sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic.

So, the concentration of acetate ions is 0.001 mol divided by the total volume.

Total volume at equivalence point: 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation gives:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration.

So, Kb ≈ x² / (0.02) → x² ≈ 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484.

Then pH = 14 - 5.484 ≈ 8.516.

Wait, but wait a second. Acetate ion is a weak base, but in a solution that's 0.02 M, and Kb is 5.4e-10. Hmm, let me compute this more precisely.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for weak bases:

pH = ½ (pKw - pKa) + log (sqrt(Kw * K_a)) ?

Wait, no, correct approach is to calculate [OH^-] from Kb.

Wait, Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10. The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So, the equation is:

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approximately 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) ≈ ?

Using log(3.288) ≈ 0.517, log(1e-6) is 6, so pOH ≈ 5.483.

Thus, pH = 14 - 5.483 ≈ 8.517, roughly 8.52.

So, equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52.

So, for the first part (25% titration), pH is around 4.26, and at equivalence, pH is about 8.52. Looking at the options, option A says 4.26;8.52. So that's option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92, which doesn't fit. Option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches.

Wait a second; did I make a mistake in calculating the 25% point? Because in the calculation, I got approximately 4.25, which aligns with option A's 4.26. So that seems correct.

But wait, another thought: perhaps I should be using the exact concentrations instead of approximating.

Wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log (n_A-/n_HA), because concentration is in a fixed volume, so the ratio is the same as the mole ratio.

Wait, because [A-]/[HA] = (moles A-)/(moles HA), since the same volume is used for both.

So, in the 25% case, the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So, log(1/3) is about -0.477, so pH is 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253, which is approximately 4.25. So option A's first value is 4.26, which is very close.

Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the equivalence point. Because in some cases, when you have a weak acid titrated with a strong base, the equivalence point is in the basic region, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate base.

Wait, but in this case, I think the calculation I did is correct. So, the pH at equivalence is around 8.52.

So, looking back at the options, option A is 4.26; 8.52. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check the equivalence point calculation. Because sometimes, when the solution is a strong base and weak acid, the pH can be calculated using the formula for a salt solution.

So, the concentration is 0.02 M acetate. Kb is 5.405e-10.

The OH- concentration is sqrt(Kb * c) = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6 M.

So, pOH is 5.48, pH is 8.52. So that's correct.

So the two pH values are around 4.26 (at 25%) and 8.52 (at equivalence). So option A is correct.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M, and it is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we analyze the two scenarios: **25% titration** and **equivalence point**.

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The total moles of acetic acid initially are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of this amount reacts with NaOH:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH added} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This reduces the moles of acetic acid to:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol},
\]

and increases the moles of acetate ion (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) to:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \), we calculate:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.0200 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10} \). Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.0200 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.0200) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

This \( x \) is the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\), so:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**.

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
