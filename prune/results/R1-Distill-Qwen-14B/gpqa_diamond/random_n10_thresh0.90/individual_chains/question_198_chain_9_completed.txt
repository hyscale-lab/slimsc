Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Alright, let me read the problem again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)2^2+ complex, right? Because that's the one with two SCN- ligands.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused about the complexes. The stability constants are for different complexes, so the first one (β1) is for [Co(SCN)]^+, the second (β2) for [Co(SCN)2]^2+, the third (β3) for [Co(SCN)3]^-, and the fourth (β4) for [Co(SCN)4]^2-? Or maybe the order is different. I should probably clarify that.

Stability constants (beta) are for successive additions of ligands. So, β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)²+ compared to Co²+ and SCN⁻. So the complexes are:

Co²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)]²+ ; β1 = 9

[Co(SCN)]²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)₂]²+ ; β2 =40

[Co(SCN)₂]²+ + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)3]^− ; β3=63

[Co(SCN)3]^- + SCN⁻ ↔ [Co(SCN)4]^2− ; β4=16

Wait, no, that can't be right because the charge for each complex increases by -1 each time. Because each SCN- is -1, so Co^2+ plus n SCN- gives a complex with charge 2+ -n. Wait, no, wait. SCN- is a monodentate ligand, so each adds -1 charge. So, for one SCN, the complex is [Co(SCN)]^+, because Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2+ -1 = +1). Then [Co(SCN)₂] would be [Co(SCN)₂]^0, since 2+ - 2*1 = 0. Then [Co(SCN)3]^- (2+ -3 = -1), and [Co(SCN)4]^2− (2+ -4 = -2).

But wait, the given stability constants might be for the successive formation, so β is for each step. So β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co²+][SCN⁻] )

β2 is K2 = [Co(SCN)₂] / ( [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN⁻] )

Similarly, β3 is [Co(SCN)3]^− / ([Co(SCN)₂][SCN⁻])

And β4 is [Co(SCN)4]^2− / ([Co(SCN)3][SCN⁻])

So the overall formation constant for each complex is the product of the β's up to that point.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex. So that's the complex with two SCN ligands.

So to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ among all Co species, we need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex and sum them up.

The species present are:

1. Free Co²+ → let's call this A.

2. [Co(SCN)]^+ → species B.

3. [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ → species C.

4. [Co(SCN)3]^− → species D.

5. [Co(SCN)4]^2− → species E.

But wait, the solution has Co(II) and SCN-; so all possible complexes can form up to the 4th ligand. But which one is dominant?

We need to calculate the concentrations of each species (A, B, C, D, E) and then find the fraction of C relative to the total.

But how to compute that?

I remember that in such cases, the fraction of each species can be found using the stability (formation) constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.

The general approach is to model the system using the formation constants and solve for the fractions.

The formula for each species' concentration can be written in terms of the total concentration of Co and the stability constants.

The total cobalt concentration c_total is the sum of all species: [A] + [B] + [C] + [D] + [E] = c_total = 1e-2 M.

The [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

The formation of the complexes is stepwise, so each step depends on the previous.

Let me try to model this step by step.

Let me define:

Let’s denote [Co²+] as x.

Then, [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^n / appropriate factors? Wait, no, for each step, the concentration is the product of the previous complex concentration and [SCN], multiplied by the beta.

Alternatively, each species can be expressed in terms of x and the product of betas up to that species.

Let me think of it as follows:

Let’s let [Co^2+] = x.

Then, [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN] 

But wait, no. The formation of [Co(SCN)]^+ is Co²+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)]^+.

The equilibrium is β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co²+][SCN⁻] )

So [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * [Co²+] [SCN⁻] = β1 x (0.1)

Similarly, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is formed by [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN⁻ → [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

The formation constant for this second step is β2, so:

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ / ( [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN⁻] )

So [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = β2 [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN⁻] = β2 (β1 x 0.1) (0.1) ) = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)3]^− = β3 [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ [SCN⁻] = β3 (β1 β2 x (0.1)^2) (0.1) ) = β1 β2 β3 x (0.1)^3

And [Co(SCN)4]^2− = β4 [Co(SCN)3]^− [SCN⁻] = β4 (β1 β2 β3 x (0.1)^3) (0.1) ) = β1 β2 β3 β4 x (0.1)^4

So now, all species are expressed in terms of x and the betas and [SCN].

The sum of all species must be equal to the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M.

So:

x + [B] + [C] + [D] + [E] = 1e-2

Substituting each term:

x + β1 x (0.1) + β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 x (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x (0.1)^4 =1e-2

I can factor x out:

x [1 + β1 (0.1) + β1 β2 (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2

So x = 1e-2 / [ 1 + β1 (0.1) + β1 β2 (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 ]

Once I find x, I can find the concentration of each species.

Then, the concentration of the blue dithiocyanato complex is [C] = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2.

So the fraction of [C] is [C] / (x + [B] + [C] + [D] + [E]) = [C]/(1e-2) = [C]/c_total.

So the percentage is ([C]/1e-2) *100%.

So let me compute each term step by step.

Given:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16

[SCN-] =0.1

Let me compute each term in the denominator:

Term 0: 1

Term 1: β1*(0.1) =9 *0.1=0.9

Term2: β1 β2 (0.1)^2 =9*40*(0.01) =360*0.01=3.6

Term3: β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 = 9*40*63*(0.001) → let's compute 9*40=360, 360*63= 22680 → 22680 * 0.001=22.68

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 = 9*40*63*16*(0.0001)

Compute step by step:

9*40=360

360*63=22680

22680 *16= 362880

362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288

So now, sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

+3.6 → 5.5

+22.68 → 28.18

+36.288 → 64.468

So denominator is 64.468.

So x = 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈ 1e-2 /64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

Wait, let me compute 1e-2 is 0.01.

0.01 /64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 → 1.551e-4.

So x=1.551e-4 M.

Now, [C] = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 → 9*40 * (1.551e-4) * (0.01)

Wait, (0.1)^2 is 0.01.

Compute 9*40=360.

360 *1.551e-4= 360 * 1.551e-4= 0.055836.

Multiply by 0.01 → 0.055836 *0.01 =0.00055836 M.

So [C]=5.5836e-4 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M. So the fraction is [C]/0.01 = (5.5836e-4)/0.01 =0.055836 → 5.5836% → approx 5.58%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is D)16.9% and C)38.1%. Wait, none of the options are near 5.5%. Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me recheck the terms:

Term 0: 1 → correct.

Term1: β1 *0.1 =9*0.1=0.9 → correct.

Term2: β1*β2*(0.1)^2=9*40=360 *0.01=3.6 → correct.

Term3: β1*β2*β3*(0.1)^3=9*40*63= 22680 * 0.001=22.68 → correct.

Term4: β1*β2*β3*β4*(0.1)^4=22680 *16=362880 → times 0.0001 is 36.288 → correct.

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. So x=1e-2 /64.468= approx 0.0001551 → correct.

Then, [C] = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2 → 9*40=360 → 360 *1.551e-4=0.055836; times 0.01 → 0.00055836. So [C] =5.5836e-4 M.

Wait, but the fraction is [C]/0.01 =0.055836 → about 5.58%, but the options don't have this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I got the β's wrong. Wait, the beta values are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, but perhaps the order is different. Because sometimes, the stability constants are given in order of increasing complexation. But maybe the β's are for the overall complexes, not stepwise.

Wait, no, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So if it's the overall stability constants, then each β is for the respective complex.

Wait, maybe I should model each complex's overall formation constant.

Wait, perhaps the β's are for the overall complexes. So [Co(SCN)]^+ has K1=9.

[Co(SCN)₂]^2+ has K2=40? No, wait. Wait, the overall K for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would be K = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

Similarly, K for [Co(SCN)3]^− is β1 β2 β3=9*40*63=22680.

And K for [Co(SCN)4]^2− is β1 β2 β3 β4=9*40*63*16= 362880.

Wait, but that would change the way we calculate [C], because each species is given by the product of betas up to that point.

So, let me think again.

If the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+ is β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)2]^2+, the stability constant is β2=40? Or is it the product of the stepwise constants?

Wait, no. The stepwise constants are for each addition. So the overall K for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is K2=β1 * β2.

Similarly, K3=β1 * β2 * β3, and K4=β1 β2 β3 β4.

Therefore, the approach I took earlier is correct, because each subsequent complex is built upon the previous one, multiplied by the next β.

Hmm, but then why is the percentage so low? 5.5% isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, let me recheck the denominator.

Wait, when I calculated the denominator, I added 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Wait, 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should include all possible species, including [Co(SCN)4]^2− and any others, but in this case, I think I included all five terms.

Wait, but the problem states that the solution has Co(II) and SCN-. So maybe [SCN] is in excess, so all the complexes can form.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the concentration of SCN- as being in excess and not changing much. But in this case, we have [SCN-]=0.1 M, which is 10 times higher than the initial [Co²+]=0.01 M. So perhaps it's a good approximation, but in reality, [SCN] would decrease as it forms complexes, but at 0.1 M, it's high, so the free [SCN] is roughly 0.1 M. So maybe the approximation holds.

Wait, but in any case, if the calculation gives 5.5%, which isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the blue color, which is the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex, but perhaps I swapped the order of beta values. Let me double-check the problem statement.

The problem says:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So β1 is for the first complex, β2 the second, etc.

Wait, but perhaps I should have considered each species as follows:

[A] = x

[B] = β1 x [SCN] =9 x (0.1)

[C] = β2 [B] [SCN] = β2 * β1 x (0.1)^2 → which is (β1 β2) x (0.1)^2=9*40 x (0.01) → 360 *0.01=3.6 x.

Wait, no, wait [C] is [Co(SCN)2^2+], which is the product of the second β times the previous complex and [SCN].

Yes, so [C] = β2 [B][SCN] = β2*(β1 x [SCN]) * [SCN] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

Which is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the beta values are given for different complexes, and perhaps the order is different. Maybe the numbering is different. Wait, perhaps the β4 is for the [Co(SCN)]^+ complex and so on. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the beta values are for the overall complexes, not the stepwise. But I don't think so because stepwise is more common in such problems.

Wait, maybe I should write the expressions correctly.

Another approach: The fraction of each species can be calculated using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The fraction f_n for the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [SCN]^{n} / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + ... )

In this case, for the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex, n=2.

So,

f2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, the denominator is the same as before, which was 64.468.

So, numerator for f2 is β1 β2 (0.1)^2 =9*40*0.01=3.6

So f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0557 → 5.57% → again, about 5.57%, which isn't an option.

Hmm, but the options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%

So none match 5.5%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents for [SCN]. Let me re-express each term properly.

Wait, for each species, the term is:

Term 0: 1 → corresponds to [Co²+]

Term1: β1 [SCN] → [Co(SCN)]^+ contribution

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 → [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 → [Co(SCN)3]^-

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 → [Co(SCN)4]^2-

So the denominator is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the beta values are given as the overall stability constants, not stepwise. So β1 for [Co(SCN)]^+ is 9, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ is 40, etc.

Wait, that can't be. Because the overall stability constants for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would be β1 * β2 =9 *40=360, which is way higher than 40.

So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering other factors, like the possibility of more than four ligands. But the problem states that the stability constants are up to β4, so the complexes up to [Co(SCN)4]^2- are considered.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the denominator. Let me compute each term again.

Compute each term step by step:

β1=9; β2=40; β3=63; β4=16.

[SCN]=0.1.

Term0: 1.

Term1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 [SCN]^2 =9*40*(0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 =9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 → 9*40=360; 360*63=22,680 → 22,680 * 0.001=22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 →9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360 → 360 *63=22,680 → 22,680 *16=362,880 → 362,880 *0.0001=36.288.

So sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

So the denominator is 64.468.

So x=0.01 /64.468 ≈0.0001551 M.

[C] is term2: 3.6 x → because [C] is the term2 in the denominator, which is 3.6. Because [C] = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) * x.

So [C] =3.6 x =3.6 *0.0001551 = 0.00055836 M.

So the fraction is [C]/0.01 =0.055836 → 5.58%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the [SCN] isn't 0.1 M but 0.1 M in total, but in the solution, some of it is tied up in complexes. But in this case, since [SCN] is much higher than [Co], the free [SCN] is approx 0.1 M. So the approximation should hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ and [Co(SCN)₂(NH3)]^2+ or similar, but no, the problem states thiocyanate.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(NCS)₂]^2+? No, the problem says thiocyanate, SCN^−. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [C]. Let me compute [C] again.

[C] is β1 β2 x [SCN]^2.

Wait, [C] = β1 * β2 * x * (SCN)^2.

Indeed, x is 0.0001551, [SCN] is 0.1.

So 9 *40 =360.

360 *0.0001551 =0.055836.

Then 0.055836 * (0.1)^2 =0.055836 *0.01 =0.00055836 M.

So [C] =5.5836e-4 M.

So the fraction is (5.5836e-4) / (0.01) =0.055836 → 5.58%.

But the options don't match. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is not considering all possible complexes beyond [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. But the options don't suggest that. Alternatively, perhaps the beta values are given as the overall stability constants, not stepwise.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose β1 is the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, etc.

But that can't be because the overall constants would be much larger. For instance, [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ would have a stability constant K2= β1 * β2 =9*40=360.

But if the problem gives β2 as 40, perhaps it's the overall K for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+. Then, the approach would be different.

Wait, in that case, the fraction f_n would be (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

But that would be a different way to compute.

So let me try that approach.

In this case:

K1= β1=9 → [Co(SCN)]^+.

K2= β2=40 → [Co(SCN)₂]^2+.

K3= β3=63 → [Co(SCN)3]^−.

K4= β4=16 → [Co(SCN)4]^2−.

So the denominator becomes:

1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

So compute each term:

Term0:1

Term1:9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2:40 * (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

Term3:63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063.

Term4:16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all terms:

1 +0.9=1.9.

+0.4=2.3.

+0.063=2.363.

+0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

So x= [Co²+] = c_total / denominator =0.01 /2.3646 ≈0.004225 M.

Wait, but that gives x=4.225e-3 M.

Wait, that can’t be right because [Co²+] would be higher than the other species, but let's see.

Wait, then [C]= [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ = K2 [Co²+] [SCN]^2 =40 *0.004225 * (0.1)^2.

Calculate:

40 *0.004225 =0.169.

0.169 * (0.01) =0.00169.

So [C]=0.00169 M.

So the fraction is [C]/0.01 =0.169 →16.9%.

Oh wait, that's option D:16.9%.

So perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the beta values are the overall formation constants, not stepwise.

Wait, that makes more sense because then the denominator becomes 2.3646, leading to [C]=16.9% of the total.

So perhaps I misunderstood the problem when considering the β as stepwise.

So the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall stability constant for the respective complex.

In that case, the denominator is 1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4.

Which gives us a sum of 1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So [Co²+]=0.01 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004225 M.

Then, [C]=β2 [Co²+] [SCN]^2=40 *0.004225 *0.01=0.000169 M.

So [C] =1.69e-4 M.

Wait, no. Wait, 40 *0.004225 is 0.169. 0.169 *0.01=0.00169 M.

So [C] is 0.00169 M.

So the fraction is [C]/0.01 =0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

So the correct answer is D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt species in the solution, we analyze the system using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the ligand concentration [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Species in Solution**: The cobalt species present are:
   - Free Co²⁺ ([A])
   - [Co(SCN)]⁺ ([B])
   - [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ ([C])
   - [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ ([D])
   - [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ ([E])

2. **Stability Constants**: The stability constants are treated as overall formation constants for each complex:
   - β₁ = 9 for [Co(SCN)]⁺
   - β₂ = 40 for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺
   - β₃ = 63 for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻
   - β₄ = 16 for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻

3. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each species is determined using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
   \]
   For [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, \(n = 2\), so:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
   \]

4. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is computed as:
   \[
   1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
   \]
   Substituting values:
   - \(1 = 1\)
   - \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9\)
   - \(\beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6\)
   - \(\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 22.68\)
   - \(\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 36.288\)

   Summing these terms:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

5. **Numerator for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**: The numerator for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ is:
   \[
   \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 3.6
   \]

6. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺**:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.0557 \, \text{(or 5.57%)}.
   \]

7. **Reevaluating the Approach**: Since the calculated percentage (5.57%) does not match any of the provided options, the stability constants are reinterpreted as overall formation constants for each complex. Using this interpretation:
   - The denominator becomes:
     \[
     1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 + 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 + 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]
   - The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ is:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{(or 16.9%)}.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt species is **16.9%**.
