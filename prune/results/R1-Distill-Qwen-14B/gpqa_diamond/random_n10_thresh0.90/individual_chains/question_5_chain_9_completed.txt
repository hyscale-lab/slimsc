Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it has components in the x, y, and z directions. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin operators are often represented this way. So P must be the spin operator for a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle. So the eigenvalues would be ±ħ/2.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That means the direction vector has components (0, something, something), but wait no, x-z plane would mean the y-component is zero. So n is in x-z, so it's (nx, 0, nz), right? So the operator P here is in the direction of n. So the operator we're considering is P·n, which is P_x nx + P_z nz, since the y-component is zero.

Wait, no. The problem says the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait no, the operator is given as components P_x, P_y, P_z. So the operator P for direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. 

So the eigenvector we're looking for is the eigenvector of this operator P, which is a 2x2 matrix, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, the problem states that the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So I need to find the eigenvector for the operator P·n, which is a linear combination of P_x and P_z.

Hmm, but the given options are in terms of cos(theta) and sin(theta), etc., which suggests some kind of spherical coordinates, but since n is in x-z, theta would be the angle from the z-axis. Let me think. So n can be represented as (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), because in spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the positive z-axis.

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2) (sin(theta) S_x + cos(theta) S_z), where S_x, S_z are the spin matrices. Wait, but the given P_x, P_y, P_z are each (ħ/2) times their respective matrices. So let me write it out.

P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Substituting the given matrices:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]], which is the Pauli X matrix times ħ/2. Similarly, P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix times ħ/2.

So P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

Wait, because when you compute n_x P_x + n_z P_z:

n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0, n_x],[n_x, 0]].

n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[n_z, 0],[0, -n_z]].

Adding these together gives:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

So P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by that matrix.

Now, we want the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So, (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Divide both sides by (ħ/2), which is non-zero, so we get:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |v> = |v>.

Let me denote the matrix as M = [[a, b],[b, -a]], where a = n_z and b = n_x.

So the matrix is M = [[a, b],[b, -a]].

We need to find the eigenvectors of M corresponding to eigenvalue 1. Because when we set up the equation M |v> = |v>, the eigenvalue is 1.

Wait, eigenvalue equation is M |v> = λ |v>. So we're looking for λ=1.

So, M |v> = λ |v> → (M - λ I) |v> = 0.

So the matrix M - I = [[a-1, b],[b, -a-1]].

For non-trivial solutions, determinant must be zero.

Determinant of (M - I) is (a-1)(-a-1) - b² = (-a² -a + a +1) - b² = (-a² +1) - b² = (1 - a² - b²).

Wait but since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1. Because n is in the x-z plane, so n_y=0, and |n|=1. So n_x² + n_z² =1. So a^2 + b^2 = (n_z)^2 + (n_x)^2 =1.

So the determinant becomes (1 - (a² + b^2 )) → (1-1)=0. So the matrix is singular, as expected for eigenvalues.

So the eigenvectors are non-trivial solutions to (M - I)|v> =0.

So writing the equations:

(a-1) v1 + b v2 = 0

b v1 + (-a-1) v2 = 0.

We can take the first equation: (a-1) v1 + b v2 =0 → v2 = [ (1 - a) / b ] v1, assuming b≠0.

Wait, but if b=0, then n_x=0, and n is along z-axis. But in the question, n is an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, including possibly along x or z. Hmm, but let's proceed under the assumption that n is not along z (b≠0). I'll have to consider that case separately.

So, the general solution is v2 = (1 - a)/b v1.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1, (1 - a)/b v1]^T, or v1 times [1, (1 - a)/b ]^T.

So the vector is proportional to [1, (1 - a)/b ].

Now, substituting a = n_z and b= n_x, we have:

v = [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ]^T.

But wait, n_x can be positive or negative. Let me consider n_x positive for simplicity, we can adjust signs later.

So the eigenvector is [1, (1 - n_z)/n_x ].

We can write this as [n_x, (1 - n_z)] after scaling, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of spherical angles.

Wait, n is in x-z plane, so n = (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), with theta being the polar angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta).

So substituting, a = cos(theta), b = sin(theta).

So the eigenvector becomes [1, (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta) ].

Wait, (1 - cos(theta)) is 2 sin^2(theta/2), and sin(theta) is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So (1 - cos theta)/sin theta = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = tan(theta/2).

So the second component is tan(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [1, tan(theta/2)].

To make this a unit vector, we need to normalize it.

The components are [1, tan(theta/2)].

The norm squared is 1^2 + [tan(theta/2)]^2 = 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2).

So the norm is sec(theta/2) = 1 / cos(theta/2).

So each component is multiplied by cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, because [1] * cos(theta/2) = cos(theta/2), and [tan(theta/2)] * cos(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

Yes, because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so multiplying by cos(theta/2) gives sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our result.

Wait, but the options are given as elements of the normalized eigenvector. So option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the question says "along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane". So the eigenvector is expressed in terms of theta, which is the angle of the direction n.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, some options have factors of sqrt(2/3) or sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar. Hmm, but wait, in our calculation, the eigenvector is spin-up or spin-down. So perhaps the actual operator is for spin, and the eigenvectors are normalized spin-up and spin-down.

Wait, but in our case, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. That's for the +1/2 eigenstate when measuring in the direction theta. So this matches the form in option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So this is the spin-up state along the direction n.

So the eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]. So that's option C.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we have. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates in terms of theta and phi, but our case is in x-z plane, so phi is zero. But our result doesn't involve phi because n is in x-z plane, so phi=0.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar, but I don't see any hbar in the eigenvectors since eigenvectors are dimensionless. So D might be incorrect because it includes hbar, which is a unit of action, but the vector components should be unitless.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, which seems off. So I think option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ simplifies to $P_x n_x + P_z n_z$, where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ and $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$ (as $\vec{n}$ is a unit vector).

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli X matrix),
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ (Pauli Z matrix).

Thus, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalue equation
We seek the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \, |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the eigenvector
The eigenvalue equation leads to the system of equations:
\[
n_z v_1 + n_x v_2 = v_1, \quad n_x v_1 - n_z v_2 = v_2.
\]
From the first equation, we find:
\[
v_2 = \frac{1 - n_z}{n_x} v_1.
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane and can be parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$), we get:
\[
v_2 = \frac{1 - \cos\theta}{\sin\theta} v_1 = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) v_1.
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
|v\rangle \propto \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The norm of the eigenvector is:
\[
\| |v\rangle \| = \sqrt{1^2 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \sec\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).
\]
Dividing each component by $\sec\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1 / \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$, the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect since eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is inconsistent with the derived eigenvector, as it involves $\phi$ (which is zero in the x-z plane).
- **Option C**: $(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right))$ is incorrect due to the inclusion of $\hbar$ and extra normalization factors.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
