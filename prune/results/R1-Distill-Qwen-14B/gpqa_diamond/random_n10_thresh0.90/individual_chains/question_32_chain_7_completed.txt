Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm. The question is asking what the energy should be so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. And X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally, but 3 neutrons would make it lithium-6, I think. Because the atomic number is 3 (Li) and mass number is 3 +3=6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases due to relativistic effects. The formula for relativistic energy is gamma times m c squared, right? Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated as 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma first.

Let me compute it step by step. v = 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So (v²/c²) is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait wait, let me calculate that more accurately. Let me square 0.96. 0.96 squared is (96/100)^2 = (24/25)^2. 24^2 is 576, 25^2 is 625. So 576/625 is 0.9216, yes. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: let me think, 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the energy is gamma times m c squared. But what's the mass of the Li nucleus? Li-6's mass is needed. So the mass number is 6, so the approximate mass is 6 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, but wait. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 1 u. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. So the mass m is approximately 6 u.

But wait, in reality, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy, but for the purpose of this problem, I think we'll just take the mass as 6 u because the problem doesn't give any specific information. So, m = 6 u.

But wait, to compute the energy in GeV, I need to convert the mass into kilograms multiplied by c squared, then multiply by gamma. Alternatively, I can use the conversion from u to GeV.

I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, each u is 931.5 MeV/c², so 6 u is 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. So m c² is 5.589 GeV. So the rest energy is 5.589 GeV, and the total energy is gamma times that.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 5.589.

First, 3 *5.589 is 16.767.

0.5714 * 5.589: Let's calculate that.

0.5 * 5.589 = 2.7945

0.0714 * 5.589 ≈ 0.400 (since 0.07 *5.589 is approx 0.39123, and 0.0014 *5.589 is ~0.0078, so total ~0.399)

So adding 2.7945 + 0.399 ≈ 3.1935.

So total gamma*m c² is 16.767 + 3.1935 ≈ 19.96 GeV.

Wait, but that's approximate. I should probably compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 3.5714 is approximately 25/7, since 25/7 is 3.5714... So perhaps 25/7 * 5.589.

Calculate 5.589 * 25 = 139.725, then divide by 7.

139.725 /7 = let's compute that.

7 * 19 is 133. 139.725 -133 = 6.725.

6.725 /7 is approximately 0.9607.

So 19.9607 GeV.

Wait, but wait. My initial calculation gave about 19.96 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option D is 21.419 GeV. Hmm. So my approximation is a bit low. Maybe I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma with more precision. v is 0.96c. v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, but wait, perhaps I should be more precise here. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly, so sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857...

Hmm, maybe I should compute 3.57142857 * 5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that more accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.589

Let me compute 3.57142857 * 5.589:

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 times 5 is 17.85714285.

3.57142857 times 0.5 is approximately 1.785714285.

3.57142857 times 0.089 is let's compute that.

0.089 is 89/1000.

3.57142857 * 89 = ?

3 * 89 = 267.

0.57142857 *89 = let's compute:

89 * 0.5 is 44.5.

89 * 0.07142857 ≈ approximately 6.357.

So 44.5 +6.357 = 50.857.

So 267 +50.857 = 317.857.

So 317.857 divided by 1000 is 0.317857.

So 3.57142857 *0.089 is ~0.317857.

Wait, wait that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I should do it correctly.

Wait, 3.57142857 multiplied by 0.089.

Let me calculate it as follows:

3.57142857 * 0.08 = 0.2857142856.

3.57142857 * 0.009 = approximately 0.0321428571.

Adding those together: 0.2857142856 +0.0321428571 ≈ 0.3178571427.

So the 0.089 part contributes approximately 0.317857 GeV.

Now, adding all three parts: 17.85714285 (from 5) + 1.785714285 (from 0.5) = 19.642857135. Then adding 0.3178571427, we get approximately 19.96071428 GeV.

So approximately 19.9607 GeV, which is about 19.96 GeV.

But wait, none of the options are exactly 19.96. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, C is 20.132, which is about 0.17 GeV higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, the mass of the Li-6 nucleus isn't exactly 6 u. Because the actual mass is a bit less due to the binding energy. Wait, but that's probably negligible for this problem. Unless the problem expects us to calculate it more accurately, perhaps using exact values.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of the atomic mass of Li-6. Let me think. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.013 u. Wait, that's right. Because the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and a neutron is about 1.008665 u.

So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass = 3*(1.007276) +3*(1.008665) = let's compute that.

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828.

3 *1.008665 = 3.025995.

Total is 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

Wait, wait, but that's the sum of individual protons and neutrons. The actual nucleus mass is slightly less because of binding energy. The mass defect is about 0.047823 u, which is the binding energy.

Wait, no, wait. The mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of the individual nucleons minus the mass defect. So the actual mass is 6.047823 u minus the mass defect. Let me check the exact mass.

Wait, according to atomic tables, the exact mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.013 u. Let me confirm that. For example, the isotope Li-6 has a mass of about 6.013 atomic mass units. So m = 6.013 u.

So m c² is 6.013 u *931.5 MeV/u =6.013 *931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that. 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV. 0.013 *931.5 = approximately 12.1095 MeV. So total is 5589 +12.1095=5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011095 GeV.

So m c² is approximately 5.6011 GeV.

Now, gamma is 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 *5.6011 GeV.

Calculating this:

3.5714 *5.6011.

Let me compute 3.5 *5.6011 = 19.60385.

0.0714 *5.6011 ≈ 0.4019.

So total is approximately 19.60385 + 0.4019 = 20.00575 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.00575 GeV. So the energy is approximately 20.006 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Option D is 21.419, which is much higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v =0.96c, so v²/c² =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, as 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

But perhaps I should compute the more precise value of gamma.

Wait, 0.28 is exact, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857... So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the value of m c squared. Let me double-check.

Wait, the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus is 6.013 u. So m c² is 6.013 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.013 *931.5 = ?

Well, 6 *931.5 is 5589. 0.013 *931.5 = 12.1095. So 5589 +12.1095=5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011095 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6011095 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6011095.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6011095.

Hmm, that's a bit more involved. Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0011095 ≈ 0.003961.

So 3.57142857 *0.6011095 ≈2.142857142 + 0.003961 =2.146818.

So total E =17.85714285 +2.146818 ≈19.99996 GeV, approximately 20.0 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.0 GeV. The closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6011095 more accurately.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

3.57142857 *5.6011095:

= (3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857) * (5 + 0.6011095)

But perhaps an alternative approach is better.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6011095:

First, multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6011095:

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6011095.

Break it down:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.0011095 ≈ 3.57142857 *0.001 =0.00357142857.

So adding all these:

5 part: 17.85714285.

0.6 part: 2.142857142.

0.0011095 part: 0.003961.

Wait, 0.6011095 is 0.6 + 0.0011095.

So 3.57142857 *5.6011095 = (3.57142857 *5) + (3.57142857 *0.6) + (3.57142857 *0.0011095)

Which is 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 + (3.57142857 *0.0011095).

Compute 3.57142857 *0.0011095:

= 3.57142857 * (0.001 + 0.0001095)
= 0.00357142857 + (3.57142857 *0.0001095)
= 0.00357142857 + approx 0.000390625
≈ 0.00396205357.

So adding all together:

17.85714285 + 2.142857142 = 20.0 (exactly, since 3.57142857 *0.6 is 2.142857142, and 17.85714285 + 2.142857142 =20.0).

Then add 0.00396205357: 20.0 +0.00396205357≈20.003962 GeV.

So E ≈20.003962 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.004 GeV. So none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV.

Wait, but where is the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6 again. Maybe I should use the exact atomic mass.

The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.0132234 u. Let me confirm that. So m =6.0132234 u.

So m c² =6.0132234 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6.0132234 *931.5:

=6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

Plus 0.0132234 *931.5 =?

Compute 0.01 *931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.0032234 *931.5 = approximately 3.004 MeV.

So 9.315 +3.004 =12.319 MeV.

So total m c² is 5589 +12.319 =5601.319 MeV, which is 5.601319 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.601319 GeV.

Let's compute this more precisely.

3.57142857 *5.601319.

Let me break this down:

5.601319 =5 +0.6 +0.001319.

So:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.001319 = let's compute 3.57142857 *0.001 =0.00357142857.

3.57142857 *0.000319: approximately 0.001137.

So 0.00357142857 +0.001137=0.00470842857.

So adding all the parts:

17.85714285 +2.142857142 =20.0.

Plus 0.00470842857 gives 20.0047084 GeV.

So E≈20.0047 GeV.

Still about 20.0047 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.127 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma exactly.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let me do that.

Wait, 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm. So I'm a bit stuck because my calculation gives approximately 20.004 GeV, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Hmm. So 20.004 isn't an option, but C is 20.132, which is about 0.128 GeV higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the nucleus is moving relativistically, so perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass. Or wait, the problem says the energy of the collider, which is usually the total energy per particle, not the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, the energy of the collider is typically the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, no, the total energy is gamma * m c², which includes the rest mass. So our calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass we're using is different. Let me think, maybe I should use the actual molar mass and calculate the precise number of nucleons.

Wait, Li-6 has a molar mass of approximately 6.94 g/mol, but that's for the isotope. But the mass of a single nucleus is 6.0132234 u, as we used earlier.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass energy as 6 u *931.5 MeV/u, which would be 6*931.5=5589 MeV or 5.589 GeV, without considering the more precise mass. Then gamma would be 3.57142857, so E=3.5714 *5.589 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 *5.589.

3 *5.589 =16.767.

0.5714 *5.589.

0.5 *5.589 =2.7945.

0.0714 *5.589: Let's compute 0.07 *5.589=0.39123. 0.0014*5.589=0.0078246. So 0.39123 +0.0078246=0.3990546.

So 2.7945 +0.3990546=3.1935546.

So total E =16.767+3.1935546=19.9605546 GeV, approximately 19.96 GeV.

So if the problem used m c² as 5.589 GeV, then the energy is approximately 19.96 GeV, which is close to 20 GeV. But the options have 20.132 GeV as option C.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of 6 u for the mass. So m c² would be 6*931.5=5.589 GeV.

Then E=3.5714 *5.589.

As before, that's about19.96 GeV, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps none. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma using a calculator for more precision.

v =0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) =1/sqrt(1 -0.96^2 )=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1/sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784 is equal to 784/10000. So sqrt(784/10000)=28/100=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as considering that the energy is in the center-of-mass frame, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. But the question says "the energy of the RHIC", which is the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass). But if it were kinetic energy, then KE = (gamma-1) m c².

So let's compute that: KE = (3.57142857 -1) *5.6011095 GeV =2.57142857 *5.6011095 ≈14.39 GeV. But that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering MeV instead of GeV, but the options are in GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck all steps. Let's try another approach.

Compute gamma exactly:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Exact.

Mass of Li-6 nucleus:6.0132234 u.

m c² =6.0132234 *931.5 MeV/u = (6 +0.0132234) *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6*931.5=5589 MeV.

0.0132234 *931.5 MeV:

=0.01*931.5 =9.315 MeV.

0.0032234 *931.5= approx 3.004 MeV.

Total:9.315 +3.004=12.319 MeV.

So m c² =5589 +12.319 =5601.319 MeV=5.601319 GeV.

E=gamma * m c² =3.5714285714 *5.601319 GeV.

Compute 3.5714285714 *5.601319.

Let me compute this with precise steps.

3.5714285714 *5.601319:

= (3 +0.5 +0.0714285714) *5.601319.

=3*5.601319 +0.5*5.601319 +0.0714285714*5.601319.

3*5.601319=16.803957.

0.5*5.601319=2.8006595.

0.0714285714*5.601319: Let's compute 0.0714285714 is 1/14.

So 5.601319 *1/14 ≈0.400094214.

Adding all parts:

16.803957 +2.8006595 =19.6046165.

19.6046165 +0.400094214 =20.00471071 GeV.

So approximately 20.00471 GeV.

Looking at the options, none is exactly 20.0047. The closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.127 GeV higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6 again.

Wait, maybe the exact mass is 6.0132234 u, but perhaps I should use more precise values for the proton and neutron masses.

Proton mass: approximately 1.00727604 u.

Neutron mass: approximately 1.008664924 u.

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass =3*(1.00727604) +3*(1.008664924).

=3.02182812 +3.025994772=6.047822892 u.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.0132234 u. So the mass defect is 6.047822892 -6.0132234=0.034599492 u.

Which corresponds to binding energy: 0.034599492 u *931.5 MeV/u ≈32.26 MeV.

So the mass of the nucleus is 6.0132234 u, which I've used correctly.

So why is there a discrepancy between the calculated 20.0047 GeV and the options?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects using the mass as 6 u, not the exact 6.0132234 u.

So let's try that.

m c² =6 *931.5 =5589 MeV=5.589 GeV.

E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.589.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.589.

Let's compute this as:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.589= ?

Wait, 0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857=0.2857142856.

0.009*3.57142857=0.03214285713.

Adding these:1.785714285 +0.2857142856=2.071428571. Then +0.03214285713=2.103571428.

So 3.57142857 *5.589=17.85714285 +2.103571428=19.96071428 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.9607 GeV.

So if the problem uses m=6 u, then the answer is approximately 19.96 GeV, which isn't an option. But if the problem uses the exact mass, it's about 20.0047 GeV.

But the options have C as 20.132 GeV, which is around 0.13 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check my multiplication again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating 3.57142857 *5.601319.

Let me compute it using a calculator-like approach.

3.57142857 *5.601319:

We can compute 3.57142857 *5.601319 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

Then 3.57142857 *0.601319:

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.001319*3.57142857≈0.004696.

So 0.601319 *3.57142857 ≈2.142857142 +0.004696=2.147553142.

So adding to 17.85714285:17.85714285 +2.147553142=20.00469599 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0047 GeV.

So I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 20.0047 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. Let me compute the kinetic energy.

KE= (gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Gamma -1= 2.57142857.

m c²=5.601319 GeV.

KE=2.57142857 *5.601319 ≈14.398 GeV.

But this doesn't match any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for c. But no, c is a universal constant.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the total energy per nucleon, but no, the question is about the nucleus X, which is Li-6 with 6 nucleons.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.96c but negative, but that wouldn't affect the energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma again using the exact v.

v=0.96c, so v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c²= 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857 exactly.

Hmm. I'm not seeing any mistake in the calculations. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, which is about 0.127 GeV higher than our precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different gamma. Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately, perhaps through more decimal places.

Wait, 0.96^2 is exactly 0.9216. So 1-0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, as 0.28^2=0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

But given that, the options don't include 20.0047 GeV. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but that would imply a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the non-relativistic formula for kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv². But that would be way off for v=0.96c.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of gamma as (1 + (v²)/(2c²)), but that's the approximation for gamma when v is close to c, which isn't the case here because 0.96c is not that close in approximation terms.

Wait, if I use the approximation gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²) for v <<c, but 0.96c is not small. So that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula E = mc² / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is the same as gamma mc², so that's correct.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Perhaps I should re-examine the options.

The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6 again.

Upon checking, the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.0132234 u. So m c² is 6.0132234 *931.5 MeV =5.601319 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.601319 GeV=20.0047 GeV.

So the correct answer should be approximately 20.0047 GeV, which isn't an option. But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects rounding to three decimal places, but 20.0047 rounds to 20.005 GeV, which still isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed. Wait, the question says speed is 0.96c. Did I misread that as 0.96c when perhaps it's 0.98c or another value? No, the question states 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me compute it again.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but the question refers to the nucleus X, so the energy should be for the entire nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the rest energy as 6.0132234 u * 931.5 MeV/u and then computes E=gamma * m c², but perhaps gamma is calculated using a more precise method.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma using more precise decimal places.

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216.

1- 0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the relativistic energy formula E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2 ), but without knowing p, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the total energy including the kinetic energy. But no, the total energy is the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should check if 20.132 GeV is what I get when I use m=6.0132234 u and gamma=3.57142857.

Wait, 3.57142857 *5.601319=20.0047 GeV, which is not 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for gamma. Let me see, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise value.

Wait, let me compute gamma using a more precise method.

v =0.96c.

gamma=1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Compute v²/c² =0.96^2 =0.9216.

1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

Compute sqrt(0.0784) as more precisely as possible.

But 0.28^2=0.0784 exactly, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma is exactly 3.5714285714.

Ok, so I think the correct answer is approximately 20.0047 GeV, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the energy using the rest mass of the nucleus in kilograms and then compute gamma*mc².

Let me compute m in kg.

1 u =1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So m=6.0132234 u *1.66053906660e-27 kg/u.

=6.0132234 *1.66053906660e-27.

Compute 6 *1.66053906660e-27=9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.0132234 *1.6605390666e-27= approx 2.194e-29 kg.

So total m=9.9632343996e-27 +2.194e-29=9.9851743996e-27 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

So mc²=9.9851743996e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

=9.9851743996e-27 *9e16=8.98665695964e-10 J.

Now, energy E=gamma * mc².

gamma=3.5714285714.

So E=3.5714285714 *8.98665695964e-10 J.

=3.5714285714 *8.98665695964e-10 ≈ 3.5714285714 *8.98665695964e-10.

Compute 3.5714285714 *8.98665695964e-10.

=3.5714285714 *8.98665695964e-10 ≈32.13e-10 J.

Wait, 3.5714285714 *8.98665695964e-10 =approx 32.13e-10 J.

Now, convert J to eV.

1 eV=1.602176634e-19 J.

So E=32.13e-10 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV = approx 2.004e10 eV=20.04 GeV.

Wait, this is about 20.04 GeV, which still doesn't match any of the options exactly.

But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for the constants.

Let me compute mc² more accurately.

m =6.0132234 u =6.0132234 *1.66053906660e-27 kg.

Compute 6.0132234 *1.66053906660e-27:

=6 *1.66053906660e-27=9.9632343996e-27 kg.

0.0132234 *1.66053906660e-27 = ?

0.01 *1.6605390666e-27=1.6605390666e-29 kg.

0.0032234 *1.6605390666e-27=5.33621443e-30 kg.

So total m=9.9632343996e-27 +1.6605390666e-29 +5.33621443e-30.

=9.9632343996e-27 + (1.6605390666e-29 +5.33621443e-30).

Convert to same exponent: 1.6605390666e-29 =0.16605390666e-28.

5.33621443e-30=0.0533621443e-28.

Adding: 0.16605390666e-28 +0.0533621443e-28=0.219416051e-28=2.19416051e-29.

So m=9.9632343996e-27 +2.19416051e-29.

=9.9632343996e-27 +0.0219416051e-27= (9.9632343996 +0.0219416051) e-27 =9.985176005e-27 kg.

Now, mc²=9.985176005e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

=9.985176005e-27 *9e16=8.9866584045e-10 J.

Now, E=gamma * mc²=3.5714285714 *8.9866584045e-10 J.

=3.5714285714 *8.9866584045e-10 =3.5714285714 *8.9866584045e-10.

Let me compute this:

3.5714285714 *8.9866584045 = ?

3 *8.9866584045=26.9599752135.

0.5714285714 *8.9866584045.

0.5 *8.9866584045=4.49332920225.

0.0714285714 *8.9866584045≈0.641632653.

So sum is 4.49332920225 +0.641632653≈5.134961855.

Total:26.9599752135 +5.134961855≈32.09493707.

So E=32.09493707e-10 J=3.209493707e-9 J.

Convert to eV: 3.209493707e-9 J /1.602176634e-19 J/eV ≈2.003e11 eV=200.3 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 3.209493707e-9 J is 3.209493707e-9 /1.602176634e-19 eV.

Which is about 2.003e10 eV=20.03 GeV.

So E≈20.03 GeV.

Again, no option matches this.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV, but I can't see where the mistake is in my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem refers to the kinetic energy. Let me compute KE=gamma*m c² - m c² = (gamma-1)m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Gamma-1=2.57142857.

m c²=5.601319 GeV.

So KE=2.57142857 *5.601319 ≈14.398 GeV.

Which is not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the total energy of each nucleon. Let me compute that.

Each nucleon has energy gamma * m_nucleon c², where m_nucleon is roughly 1 u.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

m_nucleon c²=0.9315 GeV.

So per nucleon energy is 3.57142857 *0.9315 ≈3.327 GeV.

For 6 nucleons, total energy is6 *3.327 ≈19.96 GeV.

Again, about 19.96 GeV, which isn't an option.

Hmm. Maybe the intended answer is C)20.132 GeV, but given all the calculations I've done, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 20.0047 GeV, which isn't among the options. But perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the mass of the lithium isotope as 6.941 u (the atomic weight), but that's incorrect because the atomic weight is different from the nuclear mass. Let me see.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.94 g/mol. Wait, no, the molar mass of Li-6 is around 6.94 g/mol, but the nuclear mass is about 6.0132234 u.

So perhaps the problem mistakenly used 6.94 u for the mass, leading to a higher energy.

Let me see: if m=6.94 u, then m c²=6.94 *931.5=6473.19 MeV=6.47319 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *6.47319=?

3.57142857 *6=21.42857142.

3.57142857 *0.47319≈1.6907.

So total E≈21.42857142 +1.6907=23.119 GeV, which is close to option B)23.069 GeV.

But that would be a mistake, as the nuclear mass is around 6 u, not 6.94 u.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the mass of the atom, not the nucleus. For Li-6, the atomic mass is approximately 6.94 u, which includes electrons. But the nucleus would be mass approximately 6.94 u minus the electrons' mass (which is negligible, about 0.005 u). So perhaps using 6.935 u.

But that would make E=3.57142857 *6.935 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6.935 u *931.5 MeV/u =6470.7525 MeV=6.4707525 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *6.4707525 ≈23.10 GeV.

Which is close to option B)23.069 GeV.

But that would imply the problem is considering the atomic mass, which is incorrect for a nucleus.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. Given all the calculations, I think the correct answer is approximately 20.0047 GeV, which isn't an option. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo in the options, and the correct answer is around 20 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the lithium-6 nucleus (Li-6) is \( 0.96c \), we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the mass of the nucleus, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine the mass of the Li-6 nucleus
The Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, giving it a mass of approximately \( 6.0132234 \, u \), where \( 1 \, u = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus, the rest energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.0132234 \, u \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/u = 5601.319 \, \text{MeV} = 5.601319 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m c^2 = 5.601319 \, \text{GeV} \), the total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.601319 \, \text{GeV} \approx 20.0047 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy of \( 20.0047 \, \text{GeV} \) does not exactly match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is:

**C) 20.132 GeV**

### Conclusion
While the precise calculation yields \( 20.0047 \, \text{GeV} \), the closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is likely the intended answer.

Answer: C
