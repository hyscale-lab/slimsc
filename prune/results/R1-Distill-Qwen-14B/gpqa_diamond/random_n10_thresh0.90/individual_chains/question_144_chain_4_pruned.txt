Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with some numbers in meters, so I need to compute the decay length somehow.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), multiplied by the velocity (βc), so the mean distance is cτβ.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ from the given width Γ? I think the uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. Oh wait, no, more accurately, Γ is the energy width, so the natural line width formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units here are in GeV and MeV; I'll have to make sure to convert everything properly.

Wait, so first, find the lifetime τ. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let me convert that to GeV to make things consistent. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is in units of GeV·s? Or do I need to use natural units? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the units here.

Alternatively, I remember that in natural units (where c=1 and ħ=1), the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = 1/τ. But when converting back to SI units, we need to multiply by ħ. So τ (in seconds) = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) which is roughly 2.0569e-24 seconds. Wait, let me compute that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 s.

Next, I need to find the velocity β of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 Ge
