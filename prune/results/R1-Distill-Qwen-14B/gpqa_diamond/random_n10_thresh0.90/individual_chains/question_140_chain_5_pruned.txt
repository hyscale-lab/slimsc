Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 

Hmm, melting points around 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances melt near that temperature? Well, water freezes at 273 K (0Â°C), so maybe B is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's another compound. Wait, perhaps B is a metal? Or maybe a solid that's not too low. Let me think. Oh, maybe B is something like sodium chloride? No, NaCl's melting point is higher. Or maybe something like ice, but that's 273 K. Or maybe B is a carbonate or something else.

Wait, the reaction between X and Y produces a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So G is probably some carbonate that upon heating decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. Let me think about that. For example, if G is calcium carbonate, heating it would give calcium oxide (which has a higher melting point, around 2800 K, I think) and CO2. But that doesn't fit 277 K. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal, like sodium or magnesium, but their melting points are way higher. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. The most common ones are probably CO2, H2O, maybe NH3, but let's check the proton and neutron counts. Let's see:

- For water (H2O), each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's protium, the lightest isotope). O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (since oxygen-16 is most common). So the molecule as a whole doesn't have the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, but the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So maybe each molecule has equal number of protons and neutrons in total.

Wait, wait, maybe it's a molecule where the total number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So, for example:

- CO2: C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So CO2 has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons would be (since C is usually C-12, 6 neutrons), O is O-16, 8 neutrons each. So CO2 would have 6 + 8*2=22 neutrons. So protons = 22, neutrons = 22. That fits. So W could be CO2.

Alternatively, another option: maybe H2O. Each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So H2O has 1*2 +8 =10 protons. Neutrons: H has 0 (assuming light isotope), O has 8. So 0*2 +8=8. So 10 vs 8, doesn't match. So W is more likely CO2.

So if gas W is CO2, then maybe Y is something that reacts with X to produce CO2. What produces CO2 when reacting with an acid? Maybe carbonate reacting with an acid. Wait, but the reaction is X (a substance) reacting with liquid Y. So Y could be an acid, and X a carbonate? Or X could be something else.

Wait, the problem also states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavier isotope. Maybe X is something like sodium carbonate, which has oxygen. But wait, oxygen is usually O-16, but heavier isotopes could be present, like O-18. But that's a minor point.

Wait, another thought. The precipitate G could be a carbonate. For example, when sodium carbonate reacts with an acid, you get CO2 gas, water, and sodium salt. Wait, but that's if Y is an acid. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So X reacts with a keto acid, like maybe something like acetic acid (which is a keto acid), and the product has two oxygen atoms. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: acetic acid is CH3COOH. If X is something like a carbonate or bicarbonate, the reaction could produce CO2, but the product here would have two oxygen atoms... Hmm, perhaps the product is something like a sodium acetate, which has O in it. Wait, sodium acetate is NaCH3COO. That has more than two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm off track.

Wait, another angle. The substance X and its analog are used as
