Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH, creating product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, which gives product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding any that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base. When dibrominated compounds react with a base, especially vicinal dihalides (halides on adjacent carbons), elimination reactions (like E2) are common, forming alkenes. Since adamantane is a highly substituted structure, the elimination would form an alkene.

Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—those bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. So when KOH is used, it's likely a dehydrohalogenation reaction, removing two HBr molecules to form a double bond. So product 1 would be an alkene, probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something like that.

Then, the 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. Wait, but product 1 is from KOH and 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Wait, if KOH is a base, but sometimes it can also act as a nucleophile. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—could it be that the reaction is not elimination but substitution? But substitution of two bromides with something?

Wait, but KOH usually deprotonates. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead carbon (like the 1 and 3 positions) has two adjacent CH2 groups, maybe?

Wait, perhaps when KOH is used, it could lead to a substitution reaction. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so more likely elimination. Alternatively, maybe elimination forms a cyclopropane? No, that's another reaction condition.

Wait, but the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Light yellow solids could be alkenes (like maybe cyclohexene is yellowish?), but more importantly, the IR absorption at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests that product 1 has a ketone group. So, if the starting material is a dibromide, and the product is a ketone, perhaps an elimination followed by some rearrangement, or maybe a substitution?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination, but that doesn't directly form a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then some other process. Or, maybe the base is causing a ring-opening or a rearrangement that forms a carbonyl.

Wait, wait, another angle. 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, could undergo a double elimination to form an alkyne? No, that's usually done with a stronger base and different conditions.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the bromides are replaced by hydroxide. But with vicinal dihalides, substitution would lead to a vicinal diol. But a vicinal diol would have OH groups. However, the IR here shows a carbonyl, not an OH stretch (which is usually broader and around 3200-3600 cm-1). So product 1 has a C=O, so perhaps the starting dibromide undergoes some oxidation or elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, but KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm. Maybe elimination forms an alkene, but how does that form a carbonyl? Oh wait, wait. Maybe when the dihalide is treated with a base, it forms an epoxide? No, epoxides are formed from dihalides via an SN2 mechanism, but that's for vicinal dihalides. Wait, but epoxides would have different NMR and IR.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but then maybe another reaction occurs. But no, the product is formed in one step. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH isn't just a base but also a source of OH- which could lead to some kind of elimination and then oxidation. But KOH alone isn't an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a carbonyl. Wait, that doesn't quite make sense.

Wait, wait, let me think of the structure. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons, each connected to two other bridgeheads. In 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bridgehead carbons at positions 1 and 3 each have a Br. Now, when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the adjacent C-C bonds form a double bond. But wait, if the Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, which are across from each other in the adamantane structure, would elimination form a double bond between different bridgeheads?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a ketone. Wait, but that would require the adjacent carbons to have Hs and be able to form a carbonyl. I'm getting a bit stuck on this first step.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination to form a cyclopropane ring. Because if two HBr molecules are removed, maybe the structure forms a ring. But cyclopropane would have a different NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone? But that would require two carbonyl groups, but the NMR of product 1 has a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That area is usually for CH2 groups adjacent to electronegative atoms, like O. So maybe it's an epoxide, but I don't think the IR would show 1720 cm-1 for an epoxide. Alternatively, it's a diol, but again, the IR would show OH.

Wait, wait, maybe the product isn't from substitution or elimination but another reaction. If KOH is used in a different context, perhaps it's an acid-base reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromide is being oxidized. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone because the reaction is dehydrohalogenation followed by some oxidation. But I'm not seeing the oxidizing agent here. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a rearrangement of the structure, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR of product 1. The peaks are at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is likely a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an ether or a carbonyl? But the IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, so perhaps it's a ketone. So if the product is a ketone, then perhaps the structure is such that two bridgehead carbons have lost Br and formed a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a ketone. But how?

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that upon elimination, two adjacent carbons lose HBr, forming a carbonyl. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are on positions 1 and 3, which are not adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that when KOH is added, each Br is removed, and the adjacent CH2 groups form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, maybe the base induces a hydride shift after elimination, leading to a carbonyl formation. That could be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But then the IR would show broad OH peaks, which aren't mentioned. So probably not.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let's think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. So perhaps a ketone is formed, like an acetone group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably a bunch of CH2 groups in a more shielded environment. The 1.94 (2H) might be CH2 adjacent to something else.

Wait, if product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, but that would have a ketone at a bridgehead. But adamantane's bridgeheads are usually quaternary carbons. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a diketone, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. Let's think, if two HBr are eliminated, the adjacent carbons could form a ring. But I'm not sure how that would lead to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's suppose that product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene, an alkene. Then, when heated with KOH, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, no, the heating is with KOH, which is a base, so elimination is more likely. But product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution, but with two equivalents of KOH. For vicinal dihalides, substitution would form a vicinal diol. But the diol's protons would appear as broad singlets, which don't match the given NMR. Also, the IR of a diol would have a broad peak around 3300 cm-1 for OH, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe substitution isn't the case.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, in some cases, when two vicinal halides are present, elimination can form a ketone. Wait, but in vicinal dihalides, elimination would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Wait, unless it's a geminal dihalide. Oh wait, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so the Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So elimination would form a conjugated diene or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether. Enol ethers have C-O-C and adjacent double bonds. Their NMR would show signals around 4-5 ppm for the CH2 groups. But
