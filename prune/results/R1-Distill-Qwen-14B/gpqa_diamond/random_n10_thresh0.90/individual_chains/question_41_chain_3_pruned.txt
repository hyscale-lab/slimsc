Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as 1 here. But wait, this is a situation where the medium (the glass) is moving relative to the observer. So does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light within it?

I'm a bit confused because I think normally, according to classical mechanics, velocities add up. Like, if you're on a train moving at velocity v and you throw a ball forward at speed u relative to the train, someone on the ground would see the ball moving at u + v. But wait, that's for objects with mass. What about light?

Oh right, Einstein's theory of relativity comes into play here. In special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial reference frames. So even if the glass is moving, the speed of light in it as observed in the lab frame should still be c, but wait, wait. Wait, no, because the light is inside a medium here, not in a vacuum. So I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Let me think about this. The light is propagating through the glass, which is itself moving. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, when the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light in that medium? I thought that in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. Because from the perspective of the medium's rest frame, the light moves at v = c/n. But when viewed from a different frame (like the lab frame where the medium is moving), how does that change?

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, regardless of the source's motion. But in this case, it's not a vacuum—it's a glass with an index of refraction. So in the glass's rest frame, the light speed is v = 1/n. But when the glass is moving, do we add its velocity to the light's velocity?

Hmm... Alternatively, perhaps this requires using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add linearly; you have to account for the fact that you can't exceed c.

So the formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²), where u is the velocity in one frame, and u' is the velocity in another frame moving at velocity v relative to the first.

Wait, but in this problem, the light's speed in the glass (from the glass's frame) is u = 1/n. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light propagates at c/n = 1/n since c=1. Now, the glass
