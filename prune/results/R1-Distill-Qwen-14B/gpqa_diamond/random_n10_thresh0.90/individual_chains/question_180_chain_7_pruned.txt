Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what it says.

The problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Hmm, so each has a charge twice that of an electron. But wait, the mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that part. 

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Oh, right, energy in an electric system usually refers to the electric potential energy.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy. So I think this involves some kind of potential energy arrangement. Since all the charges are the same, they're either all positive or all negative. But since the problem says each has charge 2e, I'm assuming each is positive because e is the elementary charge, which is positive. So they're all positive charges.

Now, because like charges repel, to minimize the potential energy of the system, the charges should be as far apart as possible. But wait, in this case, 12 are fixed at a distance of 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the others are at 2m away from it.

Wait, but the system's energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So I need to compute the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th charge. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ * 2m) for each. But since there are 12 of them, I need to multiply by 12.

But wait, also, the 12 charges are each 2m away from P, but what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Since all 12 are at a distance of 2m from P, but how are they arranged? Are they all on a sphere of radius 2m around P? Or are they all at the same point?

Wait, if they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary, right? But the problem doesn't specify any other constraints. So in the case where we want the minimum potential energy, how are the 12 charges arranged around P?

Wait, but wait. The system consists of 13 charges: one at P, and 12 at 2m from P. So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So each of the 12 charges at 2m contributes a potential energy with the charge at P. That's 12*( (2e)^2 )/(4πε₀ * 2m) ). Because each pair (the 13th and each 12 charges) contributes (q1 q2)/(4πε₀ r), where r is 2m.

But also, the 12 charges are themselves at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. To find the minimum potential energy, I think we need to arrange them in a way that minimizes the potential energy between themselves. Since all the charges are positive, the potential energy between any two would be positive, because they repel. So to minimize the total energy, we need to arrange them so that the potential energy between them is as small as possible, which would mean as far apart as possible.

Wait, but if the charges are free to move as long as they're 2m away from P, their mutual potential energy could be minimized by being as far apart as possible. But in reality, the minimal mutual potential energy would be when each is as far as possible from the others, which would be when they are arranged on the surface of a sphere, each at 2m from P, and as far apart as possible from each other.

But I'm trying to remember about the configuration that minimizes potential energy. For a system of identical charges, the configuration of minimal potential energy is when they are placed as far apart as possible, which is the case for a regular simplex or a regular polygon arrangement on a sphere. But calculating the exact potential energy for such a configuration might be complicated.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the system is isolated. So the potential energy of the system is the sum of all the pairwise interactions. But in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so the problem might not require considering the arrangement of the 12 charges beyond their distance from P.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their arrangement among themselves isn't considered because they are fixed at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other might vary. But the problem doesn't specify any constraints on their mutual distances. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem says the system has 13 identical particles. But 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the only distances we're given are the distances from P. So maybe the mutual distances between the 12 charges aren't given, but perhaps the problem doesn't require considering them because they can be arranged in any way, and the minimum energy would be when the mutual potential energy is zero. Wait, no, mutual potential energy between positive charges is always positive, so the minimum possible mutual potential energy would be when the charges are as far apart as possible. But without knowing the exact arrangement, perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge at P, and ignores the mutual potential energy among the 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the potential energy between the 12 themselves. Because maybe the mutual potential energy is considered negligible, or perhaps the problem is structured that way.

Wait, looking back at the question: It's asking for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the mutual potential energy of the 12 charges is non-zero, but the problem might not require me to compute it. Maybe the question is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12.

But I'm not so sure. Because in an electrostatic system, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. So if I have n charges, the total energy is the sum over all pairs. So for 13 charges, we have 13 choose 2 pairs. But in this scenario, 12 charges are at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, so each is 2m from the 13th charge. But what about between the 12 charges themselves? Let's think: Each of the 12 charges is at a distance r from each other, where r depends on their arrangement.

But in the problem, I don't have information on the exact positions of the 12 charges relative to each other beyond their distance from P. So perhaps the problem is constructed in a way that the mutual
