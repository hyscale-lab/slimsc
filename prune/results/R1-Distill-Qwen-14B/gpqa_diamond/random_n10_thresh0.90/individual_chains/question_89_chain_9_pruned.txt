Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, they typically undergo elimination reactions, especially if there's a β-hydrogen. Oh wait, but adamantane is a pretty rigid structure, so maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two equivalents of HBr, right? Heating with KOH in excess would probably lead to the formation of an alkene. Since the starting material has two bromines on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a double bond. So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on opposite faces. When KOH is used, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an allene, perhaps? Or maybe a diene. Wait, no, elimination of two HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form a conjugated diene, maybe 1,3-diene. Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid, which is typical for alkenes or maybe epoxides? Wait, no, KOH would more likely cause elimination, not oxidation.

Wait, but the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group. Hmm, so maybe the product isn't an alkene but a ketone? Wait, how does that happen? Oh wait, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides have a peak around 1250 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is more like a ketone or an ester. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, so if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a substitution reaction? But KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. So maybe it's a double elimination, but leading to a ketone? Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, maybe it's a peroxide elimination. Wait, no, that's for different conditions.

Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halogens) react with a strong base like KOH, they can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is not vicinal, but perhaps in a different position, maybe it's another mechanism.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane – so the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid with four-membered rings. So 1 and 3 being on adjacent carbons in a way that allows elimination. So eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two bromines are on opposite faces, so elimination would form a strained alkene. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a substitution reaction. But with KOH, perhaps it's more likely elimination. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial product is an epoxide, but I don't think so because the IR peak for epoxide is around 1250. Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe the KOH is acting as a base and causing elimination to form a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, maybe the compound is undergoing a pinacol-like rearrangement. But pinacol rearrangement involves 1,2-diols, not dihalides. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, that wouldn't give a carbonyl peak.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but substitution. So, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, perhaps it's a double substitution, but then what would that form? Maybe the two bromides are replaced by hydroxyl groups, but that would form 1,3-diol adamantane. But that doesn't explain the IR peak. Alternatively, maybe the product is a geminal diol? Wait, no, because two OH groups on the same carbon would be highly strained in adamantane.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually involves amines. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me look at the NMR data for product 1. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a CH2 group, maybe attached to an electronegative group. 2.41-2.23 is a broad region for 10H, which suggests maybe some equivalent protons in a ring structure, like adamantane. 1.94 ppm is another 2H, perhaps another CH2.

Wait, so considering product 1: perhaps it's 1,3-diol adamantane? But the IR would show broad OH peaks, which aren't mentioned. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but then the NMR would show a different pattern.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a diol but with some other substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination to form an alkene. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane losing two HBr to form 1,3-diene?

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is an ester or a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is being oxidized. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in ethanol, leading to an elimination, but then somehow oxidation occurs. But I don't think so. Or maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon heating with KOH might undergo elimination to form a triple bond, but that would require two dehydrohalogenation steps, and triple bonds typically have lower wavenumbers for C-H stretches, so perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. Product 1 has an IR peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. How do we get a ketone from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, maybe it's the formation of an epoxide followed by some ring-opening. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to elimination and then some kind of rearrangement. For example, the formation of a carbonyl via a conjugate elimination.

Wait, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH to form a conjugated diene, and then under certain conditions, it undergoes a hydration or oxidation to form a ketone. But the problem states that product 1 is formed directly by the reaction, so perhaps it's a diene.

Wait, but if product 1 is a diene, why the IR shows a carbonyl? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane with a ketone. Or maybe the initial product is a ketone, but I don't see how that forms from a dihalide with KOH.

Wait, another angle: maybe the dihalide is a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond. But the carbons 1 and 3 are not adjacent. Oh wait, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in some rings, so elimination would form a double bond. Wait, but if the dihalide is across a ring, elimination would form a bridge.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enol ether? No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Wait, but I don't see the connection. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. How? Maybe via a dielimination and then some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a diol, and then the diol is oxidized to a ketone. But the question says the product is formed by heating with KOH. Oxidation usually requires a different reagent.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution followed by elimination. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution, but again, not leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH to form a gem-diol, which then undergoes some kind of rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is elimination to form an alkene, and the IR peak is from the alkene's C-H stretches. But the IR at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I should move on and think about the subsequent steps, even though I'm not entirely sure about product 1. Let's see.

Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. I'm not entirely sure about this step. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is an alkene, maybe it's undergoing some addition reaction, like a dihydroxylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but I don't see a carbonyl in product 1 so far.

Wait, but product 1's IR shows 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Then, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, maybe it's undergoing some kind of ring-opening or another reaction.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is also used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes. So if product 1 is an alkene, then product 2 would be an epoxide. But then, when ozone is bubbled through product 2, it would undergo ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of an epoxide? No, ozonolysis is typically for alkenes. So perhaps product 2 is an alkene again.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. So product 1 is made from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If product 1's IR shows a carbonyl, it's likely a ketone. But how? Maybe it's a rearrangement.

Wait, I'm stuck on product 1. Let me consider the possibility that product 1 is a ketone. If so, then product 2 comes from heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. But if product 1 is a ketone, what would Al isopropoxide do? Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but where would that happen? But adamantane is a polycyclic structure; perhaps it's being functionalized.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a diol, and then when treated with Al isopropoxide, it's forming an epoxide. Because Al isopropoxide is used in epoxidation of alkenes, but only if the alkene is present. So that can't be unless product 1 is an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alkene. Then, when Al isopropoxide is used, it's forming an epoxide (product 2). Then, ozonolysis of an epoxide would break the epoxide and form carbonyl groups, leading to product 3.

Wait, but ozonolysis is typically for alkenes. Epoxides don't react with ozone in the same way. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, product 2 is an alkene again. How? Maybe product 1 is a diol, and upon heating with Al isopropoxide, it's losing water to form an alkene via an E1 or E2 mechanism. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

So, let's think: product 1 is a diol, product 2 is an alkene. But the initial product 1 has an IR peak at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 comes from ozonolysis of that alkene.

Wait, but how would product 1 be a ketone? Maybe from elimination of two HBr and forming a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a double elimination to form an enol, which tautomerizes to a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me consider the problem structure again.

1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess Al isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis.

In the ozonolysis step, ozone is bubbled through the solution at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, which is a reductive work-up. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.

So, if product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 is being asked about, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

So, let's try to figure out the structure step by step.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1.

Assuming product 1 is an alkene. The NMR of product 1 has 2H at 4.79 ppm. That could be a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, maybe an epoxide, but earlier I thought that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group. Wait, vinyl protons are usually around 5 ppm, so 4.79 might be something else, like an ether or adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol. Because diols have protons that are split into triplets due to coupling with adjacent OH groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like in an ether or epoxide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Because Al isopropoxide is used in epoxidation. So product 2 would be an epoxide. Then, ozonolysis of an epoxide doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol. Then, heating with Al isopropoxide would cause dehydration to form an alkene (product 2). So product 2 is an alkene, which undergoes ozonolysis to form carbonyl compounds.

So, let's map this out.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → product 1 (diol) → (Al isopropoxide, heat) → product 2 (alkene) → ozonolysis → product 3.

But wait, the initial IR of product 1 is 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. So if product 1 is a diol, its IR would show broad peaks around 3300, which aren't mentioned. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, product 1 can't be a diol.

So back to product 1. If the IR shows a carbonyl, it must be a ketone or something similar.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH leads to a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that usually involves diols. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a conjugated diene and then some rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the two bromides are on the same face, and elimination leads to a bicyclic structure with a carbonyl. I'm not exactly sure about that.

Wait, another angle: the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests perhaps multiple equivalent protons in a ring structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group, perhaps part of a bridge.

If product 1 has a carbonyl, let's say a ketone, then the NMR would show a deshielded CH2 group next to the carbonyl. So the 4.79 ppm could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, making it a ketone group.

So, product 1 would be a ketone, perhaps 1,3-adamantanone. Wait, but how does that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH?

Wait, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH, which abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond, but then maybe a subsequent process forms the ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the two bromines are eliminated, and the ring structure leads to the formation of a ketone via some cyclopropane opening or other rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double dehydrohalogenation to form an annulene (a conjugated diene), but then perhaps an electrocyclic reaction or some other process forms a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with KOH, leading to the formation of a geminal diol, which then undergoes a pinacol-like rearrangement to form a ketone. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Wait, the pinacol rearrangement requires a 1,2-diol, so in this case, if product 1 is a 1,2-diol, then perhaps it would rearrange to a ketone. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a diol on 1,3 positions, which are not adjacent, so a pinacol rearrangement isn't possible.

Hmm. I'm stuck on product 1.

Let me think about product 2 and beyond. Suppose product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing a Friedel-Crafts acylation to form another ketone or an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is an epoxide. Then, ozonolysis would break the epoxide
