Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the solution. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the brightness as observed from Earth (or wherever) will change periodically because the spots come into and go out of view. The problem says that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet in terms of the light curve variations. 

The question is asking: to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve (without spots), what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the star's radius? The options are A to D, with some decimal numbers.

Hmm. So I think I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then see what planet size would cause the same variation.

First, let's think about the star's brightness variation due to the spots. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer. The maximum variation in brightness would occur when the spots are rotating into and out of view.

But wait, how does the presence of spots affect the observed brightness? The star's total brightness is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas. The spots are darker, so when they are on the hemisphere facing us, the total brightness decreases.

But the problem says that the situation is similar to an exoplanet transiting the star, causing a dip in brightness. So the dip caused by the spots should be equivalent to the dip caused by a planet blocking some light.

Wait, but planets cause a dip when they pass in front of the star (transit), blocking some light. The amplitude of the dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? So the amplitude of the dip is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But in the case of the starspots, the situation is a bit different. The spots themselves are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, the star's brightness is less than when they are not. The change in brightness is due to the spots being cooler, not because they're blocking light.

Wait, no: when the spots are on the visible side, the total emitted light would be less than when they're on the far side. So the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. So the star's brightness goes up and down as the spots come into view.

But how is this similar to a planet's transit? In a transit, the planet blocks some light, causing a dip. For starspots, the dip is because the spots are cooler, so when viewed, they contribute less light. So the brightness variation is a result of the change in the observed area of the star that's hotter or cooler.

So I think I need to calculate the relative change in brightness due to the spots and set that equal to the relative change from a planet transit.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the change in brightness (ΔF) due to the spots when they are fully visible. Then, find what planet radius would cause the same ΔF.

But wait, how exactly do I model this? Let me think.

The total flux from the star when it's unspotted is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F = (1 - filling factor) * F0 + filling factor * F_spot.

The filling factor (f) is 20%, or 0.2. So the flux when the spots are visible is F = 0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * F_spot.

The difference in flux (ΔF) is F0 - F = F0 - [0.8 F0 + 0.2 F_spot] = 0.2 (F0 - F_spot).

Wait, wait, but the star's total flux when not spotted is F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is F = F0 (without spots) multiplied by the fraction that isn't covered by spots plus the fraction covered by spots at their lower temperature.

Alternatively, the star's flux when the spots are visible would be F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot.

But F_spot is the flux per unit area of the spot. Since the spots are cooler, their flux per unit area is (T_spot / T0)^4 multiplied by F0, because flux goes as T^4.

Wait, but T_spot is Teff - 1000 K? Because the spots are 1000 K cooler than the star's effective temperature. Oh wait, no, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So if the star is 6000 K, the spots are 5000 K? Or is the temp difference in absolute terms? I think it's absolute, so spots are 5000 K.

So F_spot = F0 * (5000 / 6000)^4.

So plugging that back into the equation:

F = (1 - f
