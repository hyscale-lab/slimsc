Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking what the energy is so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be... let me think. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so if there are 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6. 

Alright, so I need to find the kinetic energy of the nucleus when its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity formulas.

First, I think I should find the total energy of the nucleus, which includes both its rest mass energy and its kinetic energy. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which I assume is the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or wait, maybe the total energy? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the kinetic energy (K) in relativity is given by the total energy (gamma*m*c²) minus the rest energy (m*c²). So K = (gamma - 1)*m*c². So if I can find gamma, which is the Lorentz factor, then I can calculate the kinetic energy.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). So v is 0.96c. Let me plug that in. 

Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.0784 is what? Let me calculate the square root of 0.0784. Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly, right? Because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So the square root is exactly 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c², where m is the rest mass. So I need the mass of Li-6. I think I remember that the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539e-27 kg. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the sum of its protons and neutrons. Li has 3 protons, 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. Each nucleon's mass is about 1 u.

Wait, the exact mass might be a bit different because of binding energy, but I think for this problem, we approximate the mass as 6 u. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Wait, but since I can't look it up right now, maybe I can proceed with the approximation, but wait, I remember that sometimes the mass is given in terms of the atomic mass, but the actual mass of the nucleus is slightly less due to the mass defect. Hmm, maybe I should take the exact value. 

Wait, but I think the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus, which is given by the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the binding energy. But perhaps as an approximation, they just use the mass number times the mass of a proton. Alternatively, maybe the exact mass is given in the problem? Wait, no, the problem doesn't provide it. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton (approx 1.67e-27 kg) and neutron (approx 1.675e-27 kg) and calculate the total mass from that.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest mass would be 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron). Let me get the exact values. A proton is about 1.6726219e-27 kg, and a neutron is about 1.6749274e-27 kg. So 3*(1.6726219e-27 + 1.6749274e-27) = 3*(3.3475493e-27) = 1.00426479e-26 kg. 

Wait, but wait, that might not be correct because the actual mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to the mass defect (binding energy). So maybe I should use the exact mass of Li-6, which I think is around 10.0122 u. Wait, what's the atomic weight of Li-6? Let me think. The standard atomic weight of Li is about 6.94 g/mol, but that's the average of Li-6 and Li-7. But since the problem specifies Li-6, the atomic mass is approximately 6.94 * (6/ (6+7*0.07)))? Hmm, maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, I think I can find the exact mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units. 

Wait, I think Li-6 has a mass
