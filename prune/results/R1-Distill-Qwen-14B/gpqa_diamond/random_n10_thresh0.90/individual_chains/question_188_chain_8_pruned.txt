Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal but angles that are all the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, but wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a, right? So a = 10 Angstroms here.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is usually denoted by d, and I think the formula for it involves the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (cos^2 α + cos^2 β + cos^2 γ - 1)/ (1 - cos α cos β cos γ) )) or wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another thought: for a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. But rhombohedral isn't cubic, so I need the more general formula.

Wait, another approach: I think the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (cos α + cos β + cos γ - 1)/ (1 - cos α cos β cos γ) ) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the formula involving the reciprocal of the dot product of the plane vectors.

Alternatively, I remember that the interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula:
d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β) )

Wait, but that only applies for a cubic system, or is it more general? No, wait, for a general triclinic system, the formula is more complicated. Oh right, the general formula for d in a crystal system is:

d^2 = (a^2 b^2 c^2) / ( (h b c sin α)^2 + (k a c sin β)^2 + (l a b sin γ)^2 + ... Hmm, I think I'm getting this wrong. Maybe I should look up the exact formula, but since I can't do that right now, I need to think.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and all angles are equal, the expression might simplify. So let's proceed with that.

In a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0 (let's say a0 is 10 Angstroms). And α = β = γ = 30 degrees.

The formula for the interplanar distance in a general rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + kl cos α + lh cos α) ) 

Wait, is that right? Because for a cubic system, cos α = 0 (since angles are 90 degrees), so it reduces to the usual formula. But in this case, since all angles are the same, maybe it's as simple as that.

So for the (111) plane, h = k = l = 1.

Plugging in the numbers: h = k = l = 1, and α = 30 degrees.

So cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1 * 0.866 + 1*1 * 0.866 + 1*1 * 0.866) )

Wait, let me compute the expression inside the square root step by step.

First, h² + k² + l² = 1 +1+1=3.

Then, the second part is 2*(hk cos α + kl cos α + lh cos α). Since h=k=l=1, each term is 1*1*cos α. So the sum is 3 * (1*1 * cos α) = 3 cos α.

Wait, actually, the formula I wrote earlier is: h² + k² + l² - 2*(hk cos γ + kl cos α + lh cos β). Oh wait, that can't be right because in a rhombohedral system, all angles are same. So in this case, the formula becomes:

h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α + kl cos α + lh cos α) = h² +k² + l² - 2 cos α (hk + kl + lh)

So for (111), that's 3 - 2 cos α (1 +1 +1) = 3 - 6 cos α.

So the denominator is sqrt(3 - 6 cos α).

So cos(30) is about 0.8660. Let me compute 3 -6*(0.8660).

6 * 0.866 = 5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, that's negative, which can't be right because the square root would be imaginary. Hmm, that's impossible. So that suggests I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh! I think the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + kl + lh) * ( (cos α + cos β + cos γ) - 1 ) / (1 - cos α cos β cos γ ) ) )

Wait, that seems complicated, but perhaps in rhombohedral where α=β=γ, this simplifies.

Let me compute the denominator part.

Let me denote Σ as (h² + k² + l²) and Σ' as (hk + kl + lh).

In this case, since α=β=γ=θ, let's compute the terms:

The denominator inside the sqrt is [ Σ - Σ' * ( (3 cos θ) -1 ) / (1 - (cos θ)^3 ) ) ]

Wait, substituting θ=30°, so cos θ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator of the fraction: (3 cos θ) - 1 = 3*(0.866) -1 ≈ 2.598 -1 = 1.598.

Denominator of the fraction: 1 - (cos θ)^3 → 1 - (0.866)^3. Let's calculate 0.866 cubed: 0.866 *0.866 is about 0.75, then *0.866 again → 0.75 *0.866 ≈0.6495. So denominator is 1 -0.6495=0.3505.

So the fraction is 1.598 / 0.3505 ≈ about 4.558.

Now, the denominator inside the sqrt is Σ - Σ' *4.558.

For (111), Σ = 3, Σ' = 1+1+1=3.

So denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - 3*(4.558) → 3 - 13.674 ≈ -10.674.

Wait, that's negative again. That can't be correct. So I must be messing up the formula.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should use the general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system. Another resource I remember said that the general formula can be written as:

d^2 = (a^2) / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h k +k l + l h) ( cos α + cos β + cos gamma ) ) + ... ].

Wait, no, maybe I should use the formula from the book "Elements of X-ray Diffraction" by C.D. Schaefer. It says that for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos α )

Wait, but for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal, I think that's the correct formula. Let me try that again.

So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (1+1+1) - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1) * cos α )

Compute the denominator inside the square root:

3 - 2*(3) * cos alpha.

But wait, that would be 3 - 6 cos alpha.

With alpha =30°, cos alpha = ~0.866.

So 3 -6*(0.866) = 3 -5.196= -2.196. Again, negative. That's impossible, so the d-spacing would be imaginary. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's:

[ h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma + kl cos alpha + lh cos beta) ].

Wait, but in a cubic system, cos gamma, cos alpha, cos beta are zero, so it reduces to h² +k² +l². So perhaps the correct formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² + 2 ( hk cos gamma + kl cos alpha + lh cos beta ) )

But wait, in a cubic system that's correct. So in our case, all angles are 30 degrees, and alpha=beta=gamma=30.

So for (111), it becomes:

sqrt( 1 +1 +1 + 2*(1*1 cos 30 + 1*1 cos30 +1*1 cos30) )

= sqrt(3 + 2*(3 * cos 30) )

cos 30 is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 3 + 2*(3 *0.866) → 3 + 2*(2.598) → 3 +5.196=8.196.

Then square root of 8.196 is approx 2.863.

So d = a / 2.863 → a is 10 Angstroms, so 10/2.863 ≈3.493 Angstroms.

Wait, but that's way too small compared to the options given. The options are in the 8-10 range. So something's wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Another way: the interplanar distance can be computed using the reciprocal of the metric tensor.

The metric tensor in a rhombohedral system is a 3x3 matrix with a_ij = a^2 [ delta_ij + cos alpha ].

Wait, but for rhombohedral, the metric tensor is:

[ a² (1 + cos α) , a² cos α, a² cos α;
a² cos α, a² (1 + cos α), a² cos α;
a² cos α, a² cos alpha, a² (1 + cos alpha) ]

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reciprocal of the metric tensor is used to compute the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, when I'm given the Miller indices (hkl), the d-spacing is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (a^2) - 2 hk a^2 cos alpha - 2 kl a^2 cos beta - 2 lh a^2 cos gamma )

Wait, but in our case, alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So,

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² + l² - 2hk cos alpha - 2kl cos alpha - 2 lh cos alpha )

Wait, no, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance is given by:

d^2 = 1/( (h^2 (b^2 c^2 sin^2 alpha) ) + (k^2 (a^2 c^2 sin^2 beta )) + (l^2 (a^2 b^2 sin^2 gamma )) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta.

So, sin theta = sin 30 = 0.5.

So each term becomes (h^2 a^4 sin^2 theta) etc.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

d^2 = a^2 / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2 (h k cos alpha + k l cos alpha + l h cos alpha) ]

But wait, that would bring us back to where we were before, leading to a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d^2 = a^2 / [ (h² + k² + l²) - (h k + k l + l h) ( (cos alpha + cos beta + cos gamma) - 1 ) / (1 - cos alpha cos beta cos gamma) ) ]

Since all angles are equal, this becomes:

d^2 = a^2 / [ (h² + k² + l²) - (h k + k l + l h) ( (3 cos theta - 1) / (1 - (cos theta)^3) ) ]

Let me compute this for (111), theta=30°, cos theta≈0.866.

Compute numerator of the fraction: 3 * 0.866 -1 ≈ 2.598 -1 =1.598.

Denominator:1 - (0.866)^3 → 1 - 0.6495 ≈0.3505.

So the fraction is 1.598 / 0.3505 ≈4.558.

So denominator of d^2 becomes:

(3) - (3) *4.558 → 3 -13.674 ≈-10.674.

Again, negative. So that's impossible.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure factor or the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, maybe the given formula is incorrect, and the correct formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos(theta) )

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because for a cubic system, cos(theta)=0, so it would reduce to the usual formula, but with a plus sign instead of minus. Which would be wrong, because in the cubic case, the formula is h² +k² + l². So maybe the correct formula is:

d^2 = a² [ (h² +k² + l²) - 2 (hk + kl + lh) cos(theta) ) ]^{-1}

Wait, let's try that. For (111), theta=30°.

So h=k=l=1.

So,

d^2 = a² [ (3) - 2*(3) * cos(theta) ) ]^{-1}

= (10)^2 [ 3 -6 * 0.866 ]^{-1 }

= 100 / (3 -5.196) = 100 / (-2.196) → negative again.

That can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's compute 3 -6 cos(theta) again.

cos(theta)=0.866.

3 -6 * 0.866 = 3 -5.196= -2.196 → negative.

Which can't be.

So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The interplanar distance can be calculated using the following formula:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (1/a^2) + k^2 (1/b^2) + l^2 (1/c^2)) - (2 hk (cos gamma)/(a b)) - (2 kl (cos alpha)/(b c)) - (2 lh (cos beta)/(a c)) ) )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, and alpha = beta = gamma = theta.

So substituting, the formula becomes:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a0^2) - (2 hk cos theta)/(a0^2) - (2 kl cos theta)/(a0^2) - (2 lh cos theta)/(a0^2) )

Factor out 1/a0^2:

d_{hkl} = a0 / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos theta )

Wait, but this brings us back to the same issue. For (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator:

sqrt(3 -6 * 0.866 ) → sqrt(3 -5.196)=sqrt(-2.196), which is imaginary. That can't be correct.

Wait, this suggests that for a rhombohedral system with angles less than 60 degrees, and (111) planes, the interplanar distance might not be real, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula
