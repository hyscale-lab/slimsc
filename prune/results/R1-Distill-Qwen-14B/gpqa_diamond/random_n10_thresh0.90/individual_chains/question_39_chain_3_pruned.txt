Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

So, the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but when they measure the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So, all the particles are between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, the probability of finding the particle in a region is the integral of |psi(x)|² dx over that region. Since all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, that means the integral of |psi(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1 (because the total probability is 1). 

Wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, let's compute the modulus squared. The modulus of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²), but since we're squaring it, it's a² + b². So, |psi(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Wait, wait, because (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) is the wave function. So, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So, when you square the modulus, you get (a²/(1 +x)) + (0.5)^2.

So, the probability density is (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. The integral from x=1 to x=3 of this should be 1.

So, the integral becomes ∫(a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3. We can split this into two integrals: a² ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 plus 0.25 ∫1 dx from 1 to3.

Let me compute each part.

First integral: ∫1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), evaluated from 1 to3. So, ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 times (3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting it all together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So, a² * ln(2) = 0.5. Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, let me compute that. ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7202.

So, a² ≈ 0.7202. Therefore, a is around sqrt(0.7202). Let me calculate that. The square root of 0.72 is about 0.8485. So, a is approximately 0.8485. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the wave function? Let me double-check the wave function given. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when calculating the modulus squared, it's (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Oh wait, yes, that's correct. So no mistake there.

Another thing to
