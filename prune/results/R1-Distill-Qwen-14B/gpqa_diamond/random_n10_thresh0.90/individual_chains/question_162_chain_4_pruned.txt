Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but let me try to think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, okay, so the line element depends on x and y. I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor defines the geometry of the spacetime. But here, this looks like a 2-dimensional metric because it's only got dx² and dy² terms. So this is a 2D manifold.

The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere... oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape. But wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a surface with Gaussian curvature K = -1/(r²), where r is the curvature radius. Oh wait, wait, no, I think for a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is negative, K = -1/(r²), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature for a sphere is positive, K = 1/r², and for a pseudosphere, it's negative, like K = -1/a² where a is the radius. So if the radius is 2, then K would be -1/(2²) = -1/4. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

But the metric given, let me analyze it. The metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me see, this looks similar to the metric of a sphere but scaled. Wait, the standard metric for a sphere of radius a is (a²)/(x² + y² + a²) (dx² + dy² + dz²), but this is in 3D. Wait no, this is 2D, so maybe it's a sphere in 2D embedded in 3D? Or perhaps it's a different kind of surface.

Wait, another thought: the metric here seems to resemble a hyperbolic metric. Because hyperbolic space has a metric where the coefficients are functions of the coordinates, and the overall structure indicates negative curvature. Let me think about the form. The general form for hyperbolic space in 2D can be written in various coordinates. For example, in Poincaré coordinates, the metric is ds² = (dr² + dz²)/r², or something like that. But that's one way to represent it.

Wait, the given metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me simplify this. Let me factor out the denominator. So, 4 - x² - y² = 4 - (x² + y²). So the denominator is 4 minus the radial squared term.

Hmm, if this is a pseudosphere, perhaps the metric is of the form of a hyperbolic space. Let me recall that the hyperbolic metric can be written as ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/ (a² - r²), or something like that. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, in the metric given, the coefficient of dx² + dy² is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

Wait, but 32/(4 - r²) is positive when 4 - r² is positive, so when r² <4, i.e., r <2. That suggests that the domain of this metric is only where r <2. Because for r >=2, the denominator becomes zero or negative, making the coefficient negative or undefined. So this metric is defined only for r <2.

But a pseudosphere of radius 2... Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but this metric is 2D. Oh wait, perhaps this is the metric of a 2D pseudosphere, which would be a hyperbolic plane. Because a hyperbolic plane has constant negative curvature, which is what a pseudosphere is about.

So, the area in a hyperbolic plane. But wait, the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, so its area is infinite. But wait, the metric here is defined for r <2. So perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic geometry with a certain curvature, and the area is computed over the entire space.

Wait, the problem is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. If this is a 2D surface, then perhaps it's the entire hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. But let me think again.

Wait, the pseudosphere in 2D is actually a hyperbolic plane, which is non-compact and has infinite area. So the area would be infinite.

But looking back at the options, option D is +infty. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but why is the metric given as (32)/(4 - r²) (dx² + dy²)? Let me see: 32 is 8 *4, so perhaps the 4 is the radius term, 2 being the radius. So for r=2, 4 - r² =0, which is the boundary. So the metric is defined only for r <2.

So the area would be the integral over all x and y where x² + y² <4 of the area element. The area element in this metric is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal with both components equal to 32/(4 - r²), the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))².

Wait, no, the determinant for a 2D metric is the product of the diagonal terms. So for ds² = E dx² + G dy², the determinant is E*G. So here, E = G = 32/(4 - r²). So determinant is (32)^2/(4 - r²)^2.

So the area element dA is (32^2)/(4 - r²)^2 dx dy. Wait, no, wait. The metric is diagonal, so the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The determinant is [32/(4 - r²)]², so sqrt is 32/(4 - r²). So dA = [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

Wait, but how do I compute the area? I can switch to polar coordinates because the metric is
