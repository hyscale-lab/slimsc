Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says: Two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. Which option could be their energy difference so that they can be resolved?

The options are A) 1e-9 eV, B) 1e-11 eV, C) 1e-4 eV, D) 1e-8 eV.

Hmm, I think this is related to the uncertainty principle or maybe energy-time uncertainty. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I remember that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is proportional to Planck's constant. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but sometimes it's approximated as ΔEΔt ≥ ħ/2. 

Wait, but for this problem, I think it's about the natural linewidth or the energy uncertainty based on the lifetime of the state. Because each state has a certain lifetime, which is the time for which the energy is measured. The uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to the lifetime (Δt). So the longer the lifetime, the smaller the uncertainty in energy.

Let me think. The energy-time uncertainty relation is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. So for each state, I can calculate the uncertainty in their energy.

For the first state, E1, the lifetime is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / (1e-9 s). Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV. That's approximately 7e-7 eV.

For the second state, E2, the lifetime is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV. So about 6.6e-8 eV.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Oh, wait no, the question is about what the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 should be for them to be clearly distinguishable. So I need to find if the energy difference is larger than the uncertainty in each state.

Wait, no, maybe it's about the resolving power. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty in each state, then you can't distinguish them. So for two states to be resolved, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, the lines would overlap or be too close to separate.

So the energy difference should be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty. Because lifetime is 1e-9 s, which is shorter than 1e-8 s, so E1's ΔE is larger than E2's.

Wait, let me compute the numbers again. 

E1's lifetime is 1e-9 s. ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV ≈ 6.6e-7 eV.

E2's lifetime is 1e-8 s. ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV ≈ 6.6e-8 eV.

So the larger uncertainty is from E1. So to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the uncertainty of each. But wait, maybe it's more precise to think that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurement for each state. But perhaps the correct approach is that the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct approach is that each state's energy is uncertain by their respective ΔE. So if the actual energy difference is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, then the two states can be distinguished.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of the shorter-lived state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty of either state, the two energies might overlap in their possible ranges.

Let me think of it this way: The energy of each state is a peak with a certain width (the uncertainty). The width is given by the uncertainty. For the two peaks to be distinguishable, their separation must be larger than the sum of their half-widths (or maybe the full width? Hmm, I'm a bit hazy on that). But in terms of uncertainty, perhaps the minimum separation is the sum of the uncertainties. Alternatively, perhaps the separation should be greater than the larger uncertainty. Because if the separation is greater than the larger uncertainty, then they can be separated.

Wait, but in the case where the separation is larger than the larger uncertainty, but smaller than the sum. For example, if one state has a width of 1e-7 and the other 1e
