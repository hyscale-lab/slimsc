Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's about their peak emission wavelengths, right? And their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. But the question is about their luminosities.

Hmm, the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So I'll need to use the black body radiation formulas. Luminosity depends on radius and temperature, I remember. Oh right, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the peak wavelength λ_max for each star is the same. I remember from Wien's Law that λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because T = b / λ_max. So T for Star_1 equals T for Star_2.

Wait, but wait, their velocities are different. Oh, but velocity in the context of radial velocity—does that affect their temperature? Hmm. No, I think radial velocity is about their motion relative to us, which affects the Doppler shift of their spectral lines, but the question says to compute luminosity based on black body radiation, so the temperature would be the effective temperature, not including any Doppler shifting. Or maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So if their peak emission λ_max is the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because, according to Wien's law, same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2.

So back to luminosity. L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since T is same for both, the luminosity ratio would be (R1/R2)^2 times (T1/T2)^4. But since T1=T2, the ratio becomes (R1/R2)^2. Because R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, the options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, etc. So answer A is 2.25. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, maybe I should consider
