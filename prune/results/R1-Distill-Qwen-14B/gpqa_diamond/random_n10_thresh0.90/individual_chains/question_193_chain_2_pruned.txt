Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, and they want to know how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance. Oh right, parallax is 1 over distance. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller. So plx is 1/r, where r is the distance. But wait, I should make sure about the units. Oh yeah, typically, parallax is in parsecs, and the distance in parsecs, so plx (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r.

So the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So maybe they're asking about the differential, like how many stars are there per unit distance. Oh right, because when you count stars, you're looking at a range, say from r to r+dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr would be the number density multiplied by the surface area and dr. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is directly giving the dependence of N on plx, and we need to find how N depends on r. So earlier, I found N ∝ r^5. But wait, that can't be right because when I think about star density, the number of stars in a volume depends on r^3, but maybe in this specific case, the dependence is different.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars depends inversely on plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and since plx = 1/r, N ∝ r^5. But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of r. But wait, when you're looking at a region of the sky, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance would involve the volume, which depends on r. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the volume element or something.

Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me clarify. The number of stars in a certain region (like a thin shell) would depend on the volume at that radius. The volume of a thin shell between r and r+dr is 4πr² dr. But if the number of stars per volume is n, then the number in that shell would be n * 4πr² dr. So if n is the number density (stars per volume), then N(r) dr = n(r) * 4π r² dr.

But in this problem, how does n(r) depend on r? The problem states that N varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Hmm. Wait, perhaps N is the number of stars in a volume that varies with plx. Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So for a given parallax (i.e., a given distance), N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, if N is proportional to r^5, then when r increases, N increases rapidly. But wait, the number of stars in a certain volume would usually go down as the volume increases, unless the density increases. Oh, but in this case, the dependence is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, which becomes N ∝ r^5. So perhaps the number density of stars increases with r^5? That seems odd because as we go further, stars are less dense. But I'm not sure; maybe in this specific region, it's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps N is the number of stars per unit volume. Wait, the original problem says "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N = k/(plx)^5. Plugging plx = 1/r, N = k r^5.

Wait, but if N is the number of stars per unit volume, then the number in a shell would be N(r) * 4πr² dr. So substituting N(r) = kr^5, the number in the shell would be kr^5 * 4π r² dr = 4π k r^7 dr. So the number per unit r (like dr) would be proportional to r^7. But that's not one of the options, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for how the number of stars in the region changes with distance, not the number in a shell
