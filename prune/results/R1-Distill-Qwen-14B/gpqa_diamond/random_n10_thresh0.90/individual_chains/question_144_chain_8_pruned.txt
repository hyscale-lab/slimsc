Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, but how do I get the lifetime from the given parameters?

Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The natural line width formula is Γ = ħ / τ. So solving for τ gives τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So if Γ is 320 MeV, that's 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds.

Then, the mean decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. So I need to find the speed v of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X = 8 GeV, I can find its speed using relativistic equations.

The energy E is related to the mass m and momentum p by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So we can find p from that. Let's compute p.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let's compute in units where c=1 (for the sake of calculation), so E² = p² + m². So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(8² - 1.2²) GeV. 

Calculating that: 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. 64-1.44=62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV. 

Wait, but wait, that's in units where c=1. So the actual momentum is p = 7.91 GeV/c. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I'm handling the units correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the velocity using beta = p c / E.

So beta = (p c) / E. Since p is 7.91 GeV/c, and E is 8 GeV, beta = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV. The c cancels, GeV cancels. So beta = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. So v = beta * c ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, wait, that's a very high speed, but makes sense for a relativistic particle. So the mean decay length is v * τ.

We have τ ≈ 2.056e-24 seconds. So decay length L = v * τ ≈ (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056e-24 s) = let's compute that.

Multiplying 2.966e8 by 2.056e-24: 2.966 * 2.056 is approximately 6.106, and 10^8 *10^-24 is 10^-16. So 6.106e-16 meters. Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.0655e-16 m and A is ~5e-16. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate p. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p² = E² - m² = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 -1.44=62.56. p= sqrt(62.56)= about 7.91 GeV/c. So that part's correct.

Then beta = p c / E. Wait, but wait, in units, when c is in m/s, but perhaps I should think differently. Alternatively, beta is (pc)/(E). So since p is in GeV/c, pc would be GeV. So (pc) is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV. So beta = 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875. That's correct.

So v = 0.98875 * c ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, tau was 6.582e-25 GeV s divided by 0.32 GeV (Γ). So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s. Let me compute that precisely.

2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8-24 = approximately 6.106 * 1e-16 = 6.106e-16 meters.

But the options don't have 6e-16. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m  
B) 4.0655e-15 m  
C)5.0223e-15 m  
D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, so my calculation gives about 6e-16, which isn't one of the options. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, the Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So 6.582e-25.

Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / Γ → 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = ?

Let me compute 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

6.582 / 0.32 = approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, for beta: beta = p c / E. Wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because when I compute p, I did it in units where c=1, but when calculating beta, perhaps I should consider units properly.

Let me think again. The relation E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. So E is in GeV, p is in GeV/c, so pc is in GeV. That makes sense because E is also in GeV.

So when I compute beta, which is (pc)/(E), since pc is in GeV and E is in GeV, beta is unitless as expected.

So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) )= 0.98875. Correct.

So v = beta * c = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Correct.

So L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

First, 2.966 * 2.056875 = let me compute that.

Hmm, 2 * 2 is 4, but let's compute accurately.

2.056875 * 2.966:

Break it down:

2.056875 * 2 = 4.11375

2.056875 * 0.9 = 1.8511875

2.056875 * 0.066 ≈ 0.13606325

Adding them up: 4.11375 + 1.8511875 = 5.9649375 + 0.13606325 ≈ 6.100999.

So approximately 6.101e-16 meters. But this is not matching any of the options given. Hmmm.

Maybe I made a mistake in calculating p. Wait, E is 8 GeV. m=1.2 GeV.

So E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2) → p = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2)/(c). But when you compute in units where c=1, it's sqrt(E^2 - m^2). So p in GeV/c is sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV/c. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I got the formula for the decay length wrong. Oh! Wait, another thing to consider: the average decay length is c multiplied by the mean lifetime (tau), but only if the particle is moving at speed c. But since it's moving at v, it's v * tau. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the lifetime is calculated differently. Because I'm using the natural line width formula, which is Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, I've heard that for unstable particles, the lifetime is tau = ħ / Gamma, but sometimes people use Gamma = width in energy, so perhaps that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the width is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is tau = ħ / (Gamma * c^2) or something else. Wait, no, because the unit of Gamma is GeV, which is an energy, and ħ has units of GeV·s. So Gamma is in GeV, so when you do ħ / Gamma, the units are s. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the problem is that I used the wrong value for ħ. Let me check the exact value of ħ in GeV·s. I think it's approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the meson is moving at a certain velocity, but maybe I should compute the velocity using the relativistic beta = v/c. So beta is 0.98875, which is correct. v is about 2.966e8 m/s.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the lifetime should include the particle's energy in terms of time dilation. Because the lifetime from
