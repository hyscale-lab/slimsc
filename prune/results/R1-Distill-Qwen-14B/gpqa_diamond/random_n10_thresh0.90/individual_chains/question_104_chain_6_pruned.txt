Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected using the RV method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The problem gives me the periodic shifts in the spectral lines for each star due to their respective planets. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, RV method measures the Doppler shift, right? The star moves in response to the planet's gravity. So the velocity of the star is what's detected. The formula relating the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the planet's parameters is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 AU))^(1/3) )? Or maybe another version. Alternatively, I remember that for circular orbits, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula involving the mass of the planet, the period, and the mass of the star.

Wait, another approach: the formula I think is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P) ) )^(1/3) ) / (c * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ), but since e is zero for circular orbits, that's easier.

But M_p is much smaller than M_star, right, because Neptune's mass is much less than the Sun. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So I can approximate the formula as K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P) )^(1/3) ) / c.

Wait, no, actually, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = [ (27 * pi * G ) / (8 * c^3 * (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(-1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to find the correct formula. Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, perhaps there's a better way. Another approach I remember is that the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the planet's orbital period. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think of the relation between K and P.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the ratio of the velocities for the two planets. Since the stars are the same mass and the planets are similar in mass, the ratio of their velocities would relate to the cube roots of their periods. Because in the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Let me think about the formula again.

The formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (c^3 * (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) * (1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, the denominator can be approximated as (c^3 * M_star^(2/3)) ), and (1 + M_p/M_star) is approximately 1.

So, K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p ) / ( c^3 M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But 27 pi G is a constant, and M_p and M_star are similar for both planets, but wait, the problem states that both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both, and M_star is same for both. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, no, because K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), so K ∝ 1/ P^(1/3). Therefore, P ∝ 1/ K^(3).

Wait,
