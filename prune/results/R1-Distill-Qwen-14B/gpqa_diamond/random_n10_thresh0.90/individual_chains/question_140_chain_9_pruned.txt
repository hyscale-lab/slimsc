Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with Substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm. The question is asking about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X. The options are A) 35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

I think I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let's break down the clues.

First, the reaction of X with Y produces gas W. W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, each molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So like, if it's H2O, but H is 1, O is 8 protons. So H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So each molecule has (2+8)=10 protons. But neutrons? 0 +8 =8. So 10 protons, 8 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another gas. Maybe CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons) and O (8 each). So CO2: 6 + 2*8 =22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8=22. So protons and neutrons are same? So 22 each. So CO2 could be W. Wait, but CO2 is a gas, yes. But the reaction between X and Y produces CO2?

Alternatively, maybe CH4? But that has 4 H and 1 C. Protons: 1 (C) +4=5. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 0 (H) =6. Not equal.

Wait, maybe another molecule. Let's think about another possibility. What about NH3? Protons: N is 7, H is 1 each. So 7 +3=10
