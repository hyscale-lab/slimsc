Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question asks for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, like gold nuclei, but in this case, it's a different nucleus.

The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons and 4 protons. So the nucleus is Li-7. I need to find the energy of each ion in the collider.

I think the energy in particle physics for relativistic particles is given by the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, wait. Or maybe it's just the kinetic energy? No, in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. Wait, no, no, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So the energy E is gamma * m_0 c².

So first, I need to find the relativistic gamma factor when the speed v is 0.96c. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. Let me plug in v = 0.96c.

So, v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) ≈ 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me check that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So yes, 1/0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but more accurately, let's calculate it. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is 1/(0.28) = approximately 3.57142857. So about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of a Li-7 nucleus. Lithium's atomic number is 3, so Li-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. The atomic mass of lithium-7 is about 7 atomic mass units (u). So m = 7 u. I need to convert this into kilograms to find the rest mass energy.

Wait, 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 7 u is 7 * 1.6605390666e-27 = let's compute that. 7 * 1.6605 is around 11.6235. So 11.6235e-27 kg. Wait, more accurately, 7 * 1.6605390666e-27 is 1.1623773466e-26 kg.

The rest mass energy is m0 c². The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. So m0 c² = 1.1623773466e-26 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2. Let's calculate that.

(3e8)^2 = 9e16. So 1.1623773466e-26 * 9e16 = 1.1623773466e-26 * 9e16 = (1.1623773466 * 9) * 1e-10. Let's compute 1.1623773466 *9: 1.1623773466 *9 = approximately 10.4614 (since 1.1623 *9 is 10.4607). So 10.4614e-10 J. Wait, but we can convert that to electron volts because the options are in GeV.

1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So J to eV: 1 J is 1 / 1.60218e-19 eV ≈ 6.2415e18 eV. So 10.4614e-10 J * 6.2415e18 eV/J = ?

10.4614e-10 *6.2415e18 = 10.4614 *6.2415 *1e9 = let's compute 10.4614 *6.2415. 10 *6.2415 is 62.415. 0.4614 *6.2415 is approximately 2.882. So total is about 65.297. Multiply by 1e9 eV: 65.297e9 eV, which is 65.297 GeV.

Wait, but wait a second, that's the rest mass energy of the Li-7 nucleus. So E = gamma * m0 c². So gamma is about 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 65.297 GeV. Let me compute that.

3.5714 *65.297: 3 *65 is 195. 0.5714 *65 is about 37.141. So 195 +37.141 = 232.141. But wait, 3.5714 *65.297 is more accurately calculated.

Compute 3.5 *65.297 = 228.5345. 0.0714 *65.297 ≈ approximately 4.656. So adding the two gives 228.5345 +4.656 ≈ 233.19 GeV. Hmm, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation because the rest mass energy was about 65 GeV. So 3.5714 * 65 is approximately 232.14 GeV, but 3.5714 *65.297 is about 233.19 GeV. But wait, no, that can't be right because the options are in the 20 GeV range. That's way higher.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, the rest mass energy is m0 c². Let me recalculate that.

Wait, m0 is 7 u. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². Oh wait! Oh right, because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy is 7 * 931.5 MeV = 6520.5 MeV, which is 6.5205 GeV.

Ah! So my earlier approach was wrong because I didn't correctly compute the rest mass energy. Instead, using 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c² is easier.

So m0 c² = 7 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 7 * 931.5 = 6520.5 MeV, which is 6.5205 GeV.

Oh, okay, that makes more sense. So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 6.5205 GeV.

Compute that: 3.5714 *6.5205.

Let me compute 3 *6.5205 =19.5615.

0.5714 *6.5205: 0.5 *6.5205 = 3.26025; 0.0714 *6.5205 ≈ 0.466. So total 3.26025 +0.466=3.72625.

So total E is 19.5615 +3.72625 ≈23.28775 GeV. Hmm, but the options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So 23.28775 is close to option B, which is 23.069. But maybe I approximated gamma as 3.5714, but perhaps a more precise calculation is needed.

Wait, let's compute gamma more accurately. Because v is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28.

Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is exactly 3.57142857. So using that, 6.5205 GeV * 3.57142857 = Let me compute that.

6.5205 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute 6 *3.57142857 = 21.4285714.

0.5205 *3.57142857.

0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.0205 *3.57142857 ≈ 0.073107.

So
