Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in a reaction called the Hunsdiecker reaction, which typically converts an alkyne to a bromoalkene or something like that. Wait, or maybe it's the other way around. Oh wait, no, the Hunsdiecker reaction usually involves an alkyne and HI to produce an α-bromo alkene. Alternatively, I've heard that when alkenes react with HI, it's an addition reaction, like adding across the double bond. Hmm.

But wait, looking back, the reagents here are red phosphorus and HI. Oh right, I think red phosphorus with HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation or maybe for elimination reactions. Or wait, another thought: sometimes red phosphorus is used to remove halogen from a molecule. Oh, wait, there's the Clemmensen reduction where Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl are used with heat to reduce ketones to alkanes. But that's using Hg and Zn, not red phosphorus. Hmm. Alternatively, I remember something about using red phosphorus and HI to cleave double bonds, maybe in a reaction called the dehydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, another approach: perhaps it's the reaction where an allylic halide is treated with HI and red phosphorus to eliminate and form an alkyne. Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, not sure. Let's think about the IR and NMR data of Compound X to figure out what it is. Once I know X, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

So, the IR data: The peaks are 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region that might indicate OH (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an amine? But then 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. The 1610 and 1450 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting that together, maybe a benzoic acid derivative, because 1720 is around where carboxylic acids' carbonyls appear (though usually a bit lower, like around 1700, but maybe depending on substitution). Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone, but the 1610 and 1450 suggest aromatic rings.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. That's probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid -COOH. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding, which is typical for carboxylic acids. So, that's a strong hint.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring. So, something like para-substituted aromatic, maybe with two substituents across from each other. The downfield shift at 8.0 could be due to electron-withdrawing groups, like a carbonyl.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. Maybe a methylene or a CH group adjacent to something. Hmm.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, integrating to 2H. Maybe another CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H. That's likely a CH3 group attached to something with a neighboring CH (like in an isopropyl group or similar).

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. Probably a terminal CH3 group, like in an ethyl chain.

So putting the NMR together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid group attached to it. Then, looking at the other protons: the 2.9 ppm could be a CH adjacent to an oxygen, maybe. The 1.7 could be two CH2 groups, and the 1.4 and 0.9 suggest branching, perhaps an isobutyl group.

Wait, let's try to sketch this. The benzene ring is para-substituted with a substituent that includes a carboxylic acid group. So, position 1 and 4 might have substituents. Wait, no, para would be positions 1 and 4. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is at position 4, and another group at position 1.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons: that would happen in a para-substituted benzene where each set is a pair of equivalent protons. So, perhaps the structure is 4-something, 1-something else. Let me think.

If it's a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group, perhaps the substituent is a propiono group. But in the NMR, the aliphatic region shows a CH, CH2, and some CH3 groups.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. For example, maybe a CH(CH3) group. Then, the 2.9 ppm (m) could be a CH adjacent to that. The 1.7 ppm (m) could be two CH2 groups. Hmm.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let's see: the benzoic acid would account for the 10.5 ppm proton. Then, the substituent at position 4 would be a propyl group or something similar.

Wait, let's consider the substituent as an isobutyl group. So, if the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the isobutyl group is at position 4, but wait, that's para. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is at position 4, and the benzoic acid is at position 1 (para), so the substituent is in the para position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a CH3CH2- group. So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl chain with branching. For example, maybe a sec-butyl group? Let me think.

A sec-butyl group would have the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3). Or wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which would correspond to a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is attached to something else. So perhaps a CH2CH2CH3 group? No, wait, that's ethyl. Alternatively, the 0.9 is a terminal CH3, so maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a branching point.

Hmm, let's try to think about the structure. The substituent on the benzene ring must have a chain that includes a CH3, CH2, etc. Let's see:

Looking at the NMR again:

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): likely two adjacent CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to something, perhaps as in a CH(CH3) group.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group adjacent to another CH or CH2.

So, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a butyl group with a branch. For example, a tert-butyl group, but that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. Alternatively, a sec-butyl group would have a CH(CH2CH3)CH2- structure.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is attached to another CH2. So the substituent might be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-something.

Wait, let me try to construct the structure. The benzene ring has a COOH group and a substituent. Let's imagine it's para-substituted. So, the substituent is at the para position to the COOH. So, the substituent is a group attached to the ring at the para position.

The substituent's structure would involve the CH3, CH2, and CH groups mentioned in the NMR.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let's see what that would look like.

4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the structure where the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent at position 4 is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but wait, better to write the structure as CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-? No, wait.

Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-? Wait, no, the correct structure of sec-butyl is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-. But wait, the substituent is a butyl group, so four carbons. Let me think again.

Butyl groups can be straight chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl (with branching at the second carbon), or sec-butyl (branching at the second carbon as well). Wait, no, iso-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, and sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So, for 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the para position of the benzoic acid.

The substituent would be: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that would be a three-carbon chain. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons. So, the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH2-... Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be:

 benzene ring - COOH (at position 1)
 benzene ring - CH2CH(CH3)CH2- (at position 4)?

Wait, no, because that's four carbons. Wait, no: the substituent is a butyl group. So, butyl has four carbons, but in the sec-butyl configuration, the branching is on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be: 

-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, that would be more than four carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the substituent is an ethyl group with a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Let's think about the NMR.

In the NMR, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) suggests a terminal methyl group, perhaps as part of an ethyl chain.

So, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the isobutyl group is actually a three-carbon group where the branching is on the first carbon after the benzene. So, it's -(CH2)C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's think: the substituent is a butyl group with a branch, leading to the 1.4 ppm (d) and 0.9 ppm (t). So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures based on the options.

The options are A, B, C, D.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, let's think about that structure.

Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon chain. Wait, no, the substituent is on the benzene ring. So, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this incorrectly. Let me clarify.

Wait, the substituent would be: benzene ring connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to another CH2 group, which is connected to a CH3? No, that would be more than four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's only three carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, making it a pentyl substituent? Hmm, not sure. Let's think about the NMR.

The substituent's structure must have a CH3 group attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH2, and so on.

Wait, in the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is probably a CH group next to some substituents. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups adjacent to each other. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The 0.9 (t,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2.

So putting that together, the structure could be:

Benzene ring - COOH (para position) and substituent at para position.

Substituent is: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's iso-pentyl or something, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a longer chain. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an isopropyl group attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, such as CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. No, that's isobutyl, but that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the integration. The 1H NMR has 1H for the 2.9 ppm, 2H for 1.7, 3H for 1.4, and 3H for 0.9.

So, the substituent has a structure with a CH (1H), two CH2 (2H each?), and two CH3 groups (3H each).

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl chain with a methyl branch. Let me think: the substituent could be CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that would be a four-carbon chain, which would be butyl, but is that a sec-butyl?

Wait, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's four carbons, but that would make it a pentyl group? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH(CH3), making a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be a four-carbon substituent. So, that would be a sec-butyl group. Let me see: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's an iso-pentyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, I'm getting myself confused.

Let me try to think about the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. So, the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon substituent, but butyl is four carbons. Hmm. Maybe I'm recalling the structure incorrectly.

Wait, let's clarify: the substituent is a butyl group, which is four carbons. For a sec-butyl group, the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure of a butyl group. The four carbons are arranged such that the substituent is attached to the benzene at the first carbon. For a sec-butyl group, the substituent is attached at the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that would be a three-membered substituent, but maybe that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should instead compare the NMR signals.

In the NMR, the substituent's protons are as follows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH that's part of a chain.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two Hs on a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So, putting this together, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, no, that's four carbons, but then the CH3 at the end is the 0.9 ppm triplet (t). So, if it's a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group, that would be an iso-pentyl group, but maybe that's not the case.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests it's attached to a CH2 group, as in CH2CH2CH3. So, the structure must have an ethyl group at the end.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to another CH2, which is connected to a CH3 (the triplet).

Wait, that would make the substituent a four-carbon group: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That's a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon, so it's a sec-butyl group.

Ah! So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. That would make the structure 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

So, now that I think the structure of Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the Hofmann elimination or other elimination reactions. Alternatively, I remember that when a benzylic halide is treated with a strong base like HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to elimination.

Wait, or perhaps it's the other way around: when you have a bromide or iodide next to a carbonyl group, and you treat it with a base, you can get elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, in the presence of a strong base like HI, perhaps the benzylic position (the carbon next to the benzene ring) is where elimination occurs.

Wait, but in our case, the compound is a benzoic acid, so after the reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait a second, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Let's think: benzoic acid has a COOH group. But if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, perhaps the reaction is not directly with the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzylic position. Wait, but benzylic substitution isn't typical unless activated. Alternatively, maybe red phosphorus and HI are used for the elimination of a proton adjacent to a leaving group.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, no, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure again. The substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, which is attached to a COOH group in the para position.

So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group? No, wait, the substituent is a butyl group, so four carbons. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Then, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and substituent at position 4: -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's four carbons, but the substituent would be a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Then, the substituent is a three-carbon group, but that doesn't fit butyl.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think I need to proceed.

Assuming that Compound X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wittig reaction?
