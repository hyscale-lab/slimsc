Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm.

Alright, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So this must be a mixed state.

Wait, the formula for a density matrix of a classical mixture of |0> and |1> would be something like ρ = p|0><0| + (1-p)|1><1|, right? But here, both coefficients are 1/2. So this is an equal mixture of the states |0> and |1>.

Now, I'm trying to recall the geometry of qubit states. I think qubits can be represented as vectors in a 2D space, like the Bloch sphere. But wait, this is a density matrix, not a state vector. So how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch sphere?

Oh right! For a single qubit, a density matrix can be written in terms of Bloch vectors. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space (the Bloch vector). The vector r has components (x, y, z) and must satisfy |r| ≤ 1 because the density matrix must be positive semi-definite and trace one.

So, let me write that out. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So I is the identity matrix. Let me compute each term.

Wait, given ρ, I can compare it to the general form. Let's compute (I + r·σ)/2.

The identity matrix I is a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So (I) is [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. The term r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Each σ matrix is 2x2.

So let me compute r·σ. σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. But when you have r·σ, the components would be multiplied by their respective Pauli matrices.

But in our given ρ, we have (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then dividing by 2, we get ρ = I/2. So that's the density matrix.

Wait, so ρ = I/2. Now, let's compare this to the general form (I + r·σ)/2. So if I multiply both sides by 2, I get I = I + r·σ. Wait, that can't be right. Let me do this again.

Wait, no. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if our ρ is I/2, that would mean (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Multiply both sides by 2: I + r·σ = I. So that implies that r·σ = 0. How can that be?

Well, r·σ is a 2x2 matrix. For r·σ to equal zero, each component of r must be zero. Because if any component was non-zero, the corresponding Pauli matrix would contribute a non-zero matrix. So r must be the zero vector.

So the density matrix ρ = I/2 corresponds to r = (0,0,0). That's the completely mixed state, right? Because it's as if the qubit is in a completely random state, with no preference in any direction. So in the Bloch sphere representation, the origin is the completely mixed state.

Looking back at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that would be the correct answer.

Wait, another way to think about this: the density matrix for a completely mixed state (maximally mixed) is indeed ρ = I/2. So the Bloch vector r is zero. So yes, the geometrical position is at the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r \cdot \sigma \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, and \(\sigma = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), we see that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that \(r \cdot \sigma = 0\), as any non-zero component of \(r\) would contribute a non-zero term from the Pauli matrices. Therefore, \(r\) must be the zero vector, \(r = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which is option C.

Answer: C
