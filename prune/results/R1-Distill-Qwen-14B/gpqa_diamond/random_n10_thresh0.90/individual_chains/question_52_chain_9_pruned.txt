Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of atoms in different energy levels can be determined using the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the populations of different energy levels based on temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

Wait, the problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh, but wait, actually, how does the spot coverage affect the overall temperature? Because spots are cooler regions. So when a star has spots, it's not that the entire photosphere cools down, but parts of it are darker. But in this case, the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. Hmm, maybe they're considering the average or something. But for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the effective temperature given is the one we should use in our calculations.

So, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) is being observed. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the ratio is level 1 to level 2, I think. Because if the ratio decreases, that would mean that level 2 is becoming more populated relative to level 1. Or maybe the other way around. Let me think.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations (n2/n1) is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). So, n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between level 2 and level 1.

Wait, but wait, in the question, when the star has spots, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 atoms decreases. So, when spots are present, the ratio (n1/n2) goes down. That implies that n2 increases relative to n1. Which would happen if the temperature increases because the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. Wait, no, wait: if T goes down, then the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 (which is exp(-ΔE/(kT))) would decrease. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me rephrase. The ratio when spots are present is lower. Let's denote the ratio without spots as R0 = (n1/n2)_0, and with spots as R1 = (n1/n2)_1. The question says R0 is higher than R1, because R decreases when spots are present. So R0/R1 is the factor by which the ratio changes.

Wait, no, the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does NOT have spots compared to when it does. So that's R0 divided by R1, because R0 > R1.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So R = (n1/n2) is lower when star has spots.

So, the ratio when no spots: R0 = (n1/n2)_0 = exp (-ΔE/(k T0) ), where T0 is 6000 K.

When there are spots, the ratio is R1 = (n1/n2)_1 = exp (-ΔE/(k T1) ), where T1 is 5500 K.

So the factor is R0/R1 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T0))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] = exp [ (ΔE/(k)) (1/T0 - 1/T1) ) ]

Because when you subtract exponents, you add the exponents. So, [exp(a)]/[exp(b)] = exp(a - b) = exp(-ΔE/(k T0) + ΔE/(k T1)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T0) ) )

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, R0 is exp(-ΔE/(k T0)), R1 is exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). So R0/R1 is exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T0)) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ]) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T0 ) )

Wait, because it's (-ΔE/(k T0)) + (ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T1) - 1/(T0) )

Which is same as ΔE/(k) * ( (T0 - T1) ) / (T0 T1) )

Wait, but let's compute that value.

We know the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. So, the energy difference ΔE can be calculated using the relation E = hc/λ. Planck's equation.

Wait, but what's the exact formula? The energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, so let me calculate ΔE.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) 

Let me compute that step by step.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ) = approx 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, I think it's better to express this in terms of eV because Boltzmann's constant is in eV/K units.

Wait, alternatively, compute ΔE in eV. Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, let's compute ΔE in eV.

E_photon = hc/λ = (12400 eV Å) / (1448 Å) ≈ 12400 / 1448 ≈ approx 8.57 eV.

Wait, wait, I remember that hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å. So E_photon = 12400 / λ (in Å) eV.

So for λ = 1448 Å, E_photon ≈ 12400 / 1448 ≈ let me compute that.

1448 is about 1450. 1
