Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons are the same. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, and the melting point of B is around 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I think I should start by figuring out what substance X could be. The fact that it's used in organic chemistry as a reagent makes me think of common reagents like NaOH, KOH, or maybe something like LiAlH4. Wait, but LiAlH4 is more of a strong reducing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal, like sodium or potassium, but they usually react with water, not sure if that's Y here.

Wait, the reaction with liquid Y is violent. So Y might be water, which is a common liquid. When a metal like sodium reacts with water, it produces hydrogen gas (H2), right? So gas W would be H2. But in the problem, W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's check that. H2 has each H atom with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So for each H2 molecule, 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't match because protons and neutrons are the same number. Wait, maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 neutrons and 12 protons in each molecule? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, the total protons equal the total neutrons.

Wait, let's think about possible gases. For example, H2 has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton, so total 2 protons. Each H has 0 neutrons, so 0. That doesn't match. What about O2? O has 8 protons. Each O atom has 8 neutrons in the common isotope (O-16). So O2 would have 16 protons (8*2) and 16 neutrons (8*2). Oh, wait, that would make the number of protons and neutrons equal. So W could be O2.

Wait, but when metals react with water, they usually produce H2, not O2. Unless it's a decomposition reaction, but I'm not sure. Let me think of another possibility. What about CH4? No, that's a gas, but CH4 has 4 H's and 1 C. Each C has 6 protons, so 6 in total. Each H has 0 neutrons, so 0. So 6 protons, 0 neutrons—doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the gas is NH3? No, that's a gas, but it's a liquid under certain conditions. Wait, no, NH3 is a gas under standard conditions. But NH3 has 1 N and 3 H's. Nitrogen has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So total protons: 7 + 3*1=10. Neutrons: N has 7 neutrons (since N-14 is common) and H has 0. So total neutrons:7. So 10 vs 7—doesn't match.

Wait another thought: maybe the gas is something like D2O, but that's not a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's CO? CO has 1 C and 1 O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons:14. Neutrons: C has 6 (because C-12 is common), O has 8 (O-16). So 6+8=14. So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Oh, that matches! So gas W would be CO.

Wait, but when does CO get released? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's another molecule. Let me think of another possibility. What about O
