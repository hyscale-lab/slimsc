Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

So the setup is that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar in mass to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the spectral line shifts observed.

The data given is that Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. So the shift relates to the star's velocity.

I think the formula I need here is the one that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P), the masses of the star and planet, and the distance between them. But wait, Kepler's third law might come into play here since it relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the masses.

Wait, the formula I vaguely remember is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / [ (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ] * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ) )

But since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are sun-like, M_p is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the orbits are circular, so e is 0, so the denominator becomes (1 - 0)^(1/2) = 1. So we can simplify K as proportional to (M_p) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )? Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version of the formula.

Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But perhaps I can approach this using the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P, given that the stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses.

Wait, both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p1 ≈ M_p2. The stars have the same mass, M_star1 = M_star2 = Msun.

So the question is, how does the RV semi-amplitude K relate to the period P?

I think the formula for K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because in the formula, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and planet 2 respectively, then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) 

Wait, because K ∝ (1/P)^(1/3). So if K increases, P decreases. Alternatively, P is proportional to (K)^(-3). Let me see.

Wait, let's think about it more accurately. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial
