Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and boson decay. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not sure I'm parsing that correctly. Oh wait, probably it's more like L = -λ (ψ̄_f (y)) (something) ψ_f(y), and X is part of that something. Oh, wait, maybe the term is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) [v + X(y)] ψ_f(y). So that's a Yukawa-like interaction, I think. The v is probably the vacuum expectation value, which would make sense because in the Standard Model, the Higgs field has a vev v, and then Yukawa terms involve the Higgs coupling.

But wait, wait. In this Lagrangian, X is interacting with the fermions f. So the interaction term is λ f times ψ̄ (v + X) ψ, right? So that suggests that X is a scalar field, since it's added in the same way as the vev v. So when X is quantized, the boson X will have interactions proportional to λ f, and the fermions are the ones in the loop.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. Now, the question is about the allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order. So, what particles can X decay into?

In particle physics, when a boson decays, it can decay into fermions (like quarks or leptons) if the interaction allows it. The decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of X. So, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so any fermion pair that sums to less than 6 GeV can be a possible decay product.

But wait, the fermions that X can decay into depend on the interaction term. The interaction here is between X and the fermions f. So the fermions that X can decay into are the ones that are present in the interaction term. So the possible decay products are pairs of these fermions.

Looking at the options, each option lists a set of possible decay channels. Let's see what each option includes.

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-
So that's the bottom quark, strange, up, down, tau, and electron pairs.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
So that's charm, strange, up, down, tau, muon, electron pairs.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Includes charm, strange, up, down, top quark, tau, muon, electron.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-
Same as A but without tau and includes muon and e.

Wait, but wait. The interaction term given is -λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ. So the fermions f that are involved in the interaction are the ones in the ψ terms. So which fermions can X decay into? It would be the fermions f in the theory, because the interaction term allows X to couple to them.

But wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to all fermions except the top quark? No, actually, the top quark does couple. Wait, no, the Higgs gives mass to all fermions. So perhaps in this case, the fermion f runs over all the Standard Model fermions.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify which fermions f are in the theory. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is using the Standard Model context, where the fermions are the quarks and leptons. But the Yukawa coupling would then be for each fermion type.

But wait, the problem is about the decay of X. So X would decay into any fermion pair if the mass of the fermion is less than X's mass (6 GeV) divided by two, since each fermion in the pair would have about half the mass, but wait, no, because the mass would be for each particle. Wait, each fermion in the pair would have mass m, so the sum is 2m, which must be less than 6 GeV. So m would have to be less than 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

- Up quark: negligible, around 2 MeV.
- Down quark: around 4-5 MeV.
- Strange: about 100 MeV.
- Charm: around 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom: around 4.5 GeV.
- Top: way too heavy, around 173 GeV, which is way above 6 GeV.

Leptons: electron is ~0.0005 GeV, muon ~0.105 GeV, tau ~1.78 GeV.

So for each possible fermion pair that X can decay into, the sum of their masses needs to be ≤ 6 GeV.

So for quarks, let's see:

- b quark: mass ~4.5 GeV. So a pair of b quarks would be 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b bbar, because 2*4.5 =9 GeV >6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the mass of the fermion is the rest mass. When a particle decays, the energy available is the mass of X, so m_X =6 GeV. So each decay product gets E ≈ m_X/2. But the rest mass of each is much less than 6 GeV, so in reality, the decay can proceed as long as the sum of the rest masses is less than m_X.

Wait, no, that's not right. When a particle decays into two particles, their rest masses must each be less than m_X/2. Because the decay products can't have rest mass greater than half the parent's mass. Because in the center of mass frame, each daughter would have at least their rest mass energy. So if each is less than m_X/2, then 2*(m_X/2) = m_X, which is the total.

So for a pair like b bbar: each b has mass ~4.5 GeV. 4.5 > 6/2=3 GeV. So that's not allowed. So X can't decay into b quarks.

Wait, but what about other quarks. For example, c quark has mass ~1.25 GeV. So 2*1.25=2.5 <6 GeV. So that's allowed. So X can decay into c cbar.

Similarly, s quark: 100 MeV. 2*0.1=0.2 <6 GeV. So s sbar is allowed.

u and d are even lighter, so their pairs are allowed.

What about top quark? Its mass is about 173 GeV, way larger than 6 GeV, so t tbar is impossible.

Now, for leptons. Tau has mass ~1.78 GeV. 2*1.78=3.56 GeV <6 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV. 2*0.105=0.21 <6 GeV.

Electron: negligible, so e+ e- is allowed.

So the possible decay channels are for fermion pairs where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV.

So possible fermions are:

c: 1.25 GeV (allowed, as 2*1.25=2.5<6)

s: 0.1 GeV (0.2<6)

u: 2 MeV (negligible, 0.004<6)

d: 4-5 MeV (0.008-0.01 <6)

tau: 1.78 GeV (3.56<6)

mu: 0.105 (0.21 <6)

e: 0.0005 (0.001<6)

But the b quark is 4.5 GeV: 2*4.5=9>6, so not allowed.

So X can decay into c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but the options don't all include these. Let's look again.

Option A: Includes b, which is not allowed as per above.

Option B: Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t (no, t is too heavy), tau, mu, e.

Option D: Includes b, which isn't allowed.

So the only option that includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e is option B.

Wait, but I thought the interaction term allows X to decay into any fermion f. So in the problem, the fermions f are which ones?

Wait, the interaction term is -λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ. So the fermion ψ is f. So the possible decay products are all the fermions f that are present in the interaction. So which fermions are present?

Wait, the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. The problem statement doesn't specify which fermions are present. Hmm, that's a problem. Because if the interaction includes, say, only the charged leptons or only the up-type quarks, that determines which decay channels are allowed.

Wait, but the problem gives options that include quarks and leptons. So perhaps the interaction term is allowing all possible fermions. Or maybe the interaction is such that all possible fermions are included.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to all fermions. So perhaps in our case, the X field is similar to the Higgs, so it couples to all fermions.

So in that case, X can decay into any fermion pair as long as the pair's mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, that would allow the decay into c cbar (since 2*1.25=2.5 GeV <6), but not b bbar (9 GeV>6).

So the possible decay channels would include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking back at the options, option B includes these.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the Lagrangian, the interaction term might only involve specific fermions. For example, if the interaction only involves quarks, then the decay products are quarks. But the options include leptons as well. So perhaps the interaction is general.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all fermions are included in the interaction. So the correct possible decay channels are those with fermion pairs whose sum is less than 6 GeV.

So the possible pairs are any fermion-antifermion pair where each has mass less than 3 GeV.

So for quarks: u, d, s, c (since their masses are under 3 GeV each). But not b or t, as discussed.

For leptons: e, mu, tau.

So all these can be decay products.

Looking back at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

So that would be the correct option.

But wait, could the problem have a different approach? For example, the interaction term. The term is L = -λ f (ψ̄ (v + X) ψ). Wait, perhaps the f is a Yukawa coupling, and the fermions are the ones that f refers to.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is written as L = -λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ, where f is the Yukawa coupling for the fermion ψ. So each fermion has its own coupling. So the possible decay products would include all the fermions ψ that are present in the theory, as long as their mass is less than 3 GeV.

But unless told which fermions are included, we have to assume all possible are included.

So the conclusion is that X can decay into any fermion pair where m <3 GeV.

So the possible decay channels are c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Which matches option B.

Wait, but wait. I thought the interaction term was written as -λ f ψ̄ (v + X) ψ. So for each fermion ψ, you have a coupling λ f. So the possible decay channels are all the fermions ψ that are present in the interaction. So if the fermions in the interaction are only the quarks, then the decay products would be quarks. But the options have both quarks and leptons. So perhaps the interaction includes all fermions, like the Higgs does.

In that case, option B is correct.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y).
\]

This interaction suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \), and the decay products of \( X \) depend on the fermions present in the interaction. The decays are kinematically allowed if the combined rest mass of the decay products is less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \), or equivalently \( m_f < 3 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses
1. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)) and down (\( d \)) quarks: Negligibly small masses (\(< 3 \, \text{GeV}\)), so \( u \bar{u} \) and \( d \bar{d} \) are allowed.
   - Strange (\( s \)) quark: \( m_s \approx 100 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( s \bar{s} \) is allowed.
   - Charm (\( c \)) quark: \( m_c \approx 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( c \bar{c} \) is allowed.
   - Bottom (\( b \)) quark: \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( b \bar{b} \) is **not** allowed (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)) quark: \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( t \bar{t} \) is **not** allowed.

2. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( e^+ e^- \) is allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( \mu^+ \mu^- \) is allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( \tau^+ \tau^- \) is allowed.

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed (\( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed (\( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
