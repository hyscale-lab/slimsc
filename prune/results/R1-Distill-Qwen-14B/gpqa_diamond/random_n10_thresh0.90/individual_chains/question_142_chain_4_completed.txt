Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are points in 3D space, so r=(x,y,z). 

Wait, I remember that for qubits, the state space is a 2-dimensional space, but when visualizing, it's often embedded in a 3D space, like the Bloch sphere. So the density matrix describes a mixed state, right?

Density matrices for qubits are 2x2. The given ρ looks like it's a diagonal matrix with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal. Because when you compute |0><0|, it's a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere, and similarly for |1><1|. So adding them and multiplying by 1/2 gives each diagonal element as 1/2. So ρ is diagonal with [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2].

Now, the density matrix for a pure state is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. For a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture. Wait, this ρ looks like a completely mixed state. Because if you have 50% in state |0> and 50% in state |1>, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit.

The maximally mixed state in the Bloch sphere is represented by the origin, right? Because the Bloch vector is (x,y,z), and for the completely mixed state, the vector is (0,0,0). Because a general density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector. So if the state is maximally mixed, the density matrix is I/2. So in that case, r must be zero.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me think again. The density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Does that represent a completely mixed state? Yes, because each basis state has equal probability. So the Bloch vector would be zero because the state is equally likely to be |0> or |1>, which are opposite points on the Bloch sphere. The average would be the origin.

So the geometrical position is the origin, which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) on the diagonal, which corresponds to a maximally mixed state for a qubit. A maximally mixed state is represented by the origin in the Bloch sphere, as its Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 0)\). This is because the density matrix for a general qubit state can be written as \((I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) / 2\), where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. For the maximally mixed state, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options, the point \((0, 0, 0)\) corresponds to the origin, which is the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space.

Answer: C
