Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so the first thing I remember is that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)) or something like that. Wait, no, I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, which one is which? Let me get that right.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So if I'm sitting on A, what's the speed of B relative to me? Oh wait, wait. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference divided by that factor.

Wait, but wait. Actually, the formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same direction is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1 v2)/c² ). So here, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So plug those numbers in.

So numerator is (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Which is approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c.

Now, the total energy part. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each's energy is gamma * m c squared. So for each, compute gamma, multiply by their mass, add them together.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut, v is 0.6c. So v squared is 0.36 c². 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the mass given is 2m for the first and 3m for the second. So astronaut A has mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So energy E1 = gamma * (2m) c².

For astronaut A: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B: v is 0.5c. So gamma for B is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 *3 = 3.464 mc².

So total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 +3.464 =5.964 mc². So approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and D has 5 mc². So the total energy is around 5.96.

Looking back at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that matches. Option B has lower energy but same speed. Option D has a lower energy and same speed as C.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: Is the total energy just the sum of their individual energies? Because in relativity, energy is additive in the center of momentum frame. Or does the problem consider the system's rest frame? Hmm, but the question says "the total energy of the system," which I think refers to the sum of their relativistic energies as measured in the same frame, perhaps the rest frame where the combined momentum is zero. Wait no, because the problem doesn't specify the frame. Oh wait, but in the problem statement, I think the velocities are given in the lab frame, which is the same for both astronauts. So the total energy would just be the sum of their energies in that frame.

Wait, but wait, what's the lab frame here? It depends on how the question is structured. But the problem states the speeds are in the positive x-direction, so it's probably from the lab frame, which is not necessarily the rest frame of either astronaut. So the total energy is E1 + E2, which is 2.5 + 3.464 =5.964 mc², so option C. Option C says E=5.96 mc², and v_rel=0.14c.

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2\).

These match the values in **Option C**.
