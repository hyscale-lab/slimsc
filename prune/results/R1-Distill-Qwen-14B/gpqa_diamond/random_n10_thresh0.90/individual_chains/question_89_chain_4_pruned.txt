Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it's heated with excess KOH. Then the product is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. After that, ozone is bubbled through the solution of the second product, followed by dimethylsulfide to give the third product. Finally, I need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR spectrum of product 3.

Let me start by recalling what each reaction does.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess), heated to 240°C.

Dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms in the 1 and 3 positions. When dibromides react with KOH, especially in an elimination reaction, it typically forms an alkene. Since KOH is a strong base, elimination (E2 mechanism) is likely. So, two molecules of HBr would be eliminated, and we'd form a double bond between carbons 1 and 3. So the first product, product 1, is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or a similar diene.

The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, that's a strong peak, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). But wait, elimination of HBr from a dibromide would produce an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides form when an alcohol reacts, but KOH is a base, maybe it's an elimination to form a double bond. Wait, but 1720 is more in line with a carbonyl like a ketone or ester.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe the reaction is different. Oh wait, perhaps it's a ring-opening or something else. Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is a di-bromide, and KOH is in excess, perhaps it's an SN2 reaction. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane... if it's a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2), then elimination would form a double bond. But 1,3 dibromide might not be vicinal. Wait, adamantane's structure is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions on adamantane are probably adjacent, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, in adamantane, the structure is such that each carbon is connected in a way that each is connected to three others. So positions 1 and 3 might be across from each other, but perhaps not adjacent. So perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a non-adjacent dihalide.

Wait, if it's 1,3-dibromo, then the bromine atoms are not on adjacent carbons. So elimination would require each Br to be on adjacent carbons to form a double bond. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe each Br is in a position that when KOH is present, it leads to a ring-opening.

Wait, perhaps when 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, it undergoes a double elimination, forming a ketone. Because I remember that in some cases, treatment of dihalides with strong base can lead to ketones. For example, in the formation of cyclohexanone from 1,2-dibromocyclohexane using KOH—wait, no, that would form cyclohexene. Wait, maybe if the dihalide is 1 and 3 on a ring, and elimination would form a double bond, but that doesn't explain the IR peak.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. How? If it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination would give an alkene, but if it's a geminal dihalide, elimination would give a carbonyl. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not geminal. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the IR data again. The product 1 has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group. So product 1 is a ketone. So how do I get a ketone from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening. For example, in some ring structures, dihalides can form rings with elimination of HX. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, with each carbon bonded to three others. So any ring opening would be complex. Alternatively, 1,3-dibromoadamantane could lose two HBr molecules in a double elimination, forming a double bond. But that would give an alkene, which doesn't explain the IR peak. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide. But no, because KOH is a base, not an acid catalyst. Wait, no, epoxide formation isn't here. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring expansion.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a double elimination, but rather than forming a double bond, perhaps it forms a carbonyl. For that, perhaps the dihalide is in a position where elimination leads to a ketone. How does that happen?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and when KOH is added, it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to formation of a carbonyl group via elimination. But how?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about another angle. The NMR of product 1 is given as 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is probably a singlet for two hydrogens, maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom. But in product 1, which is a ketone perhaps, the singlet at 4.79 could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. But since IR shows a carbonyl, maybe it's a ketone with some CH2 groups adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. But I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should proceed to think about the second reaction and see if that helps.

Second Reaction: Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of alkylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. Friedel-Crafts acylation would require an acylium ion. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's being used in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. So product 2 would be an aromatic compound with an acyl group attached. But wait, product 1 is adamantane-derived, which is a saturated hydrocarbon. Unless product 1 is an aromatic compound, which I don't think it is.

Wait, another possibility: maybe product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a cyclopropane or another ring structure. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene because the first reaction was elimination of HBr. Then, heating with aluminum isopropoxide could cause some cycloaddition or some kind of ring formation. For example, a diene could undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition or form a ring via some Diels-Alder-like process? But Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, maybe it's a catalyst for some Diels-Alder reaction. But without an electron-deficient dienophile, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is a secondary alcohol. But that doesn't make sense with the reagent.

Wait, another approach: think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups.

Let me imagine that product 2 is a diene because product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is formed by treatment with aluminum isopropoxide. But that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps aluminum isopropoxide is used in a different reaction, like a Grignard-like reaction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the first reaction forms a diene, and the second reaction is a Diels-Alder reaction. But without a dienophile, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is a ring-opening or some addition.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR of product 1 again. The 4.79 (2H) is probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a lot of equivalent CH2 groups, perhaps in a ring structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene (a diene), its structure would have four rings, perhaps with double bonds. But how would that lead to the NMR signals? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane? No, because cyclopropane doesn't have strong IR peaks at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Wait, let me try to think of another possibility. If the first reaction forms a ketone, then product 1 is a ketone. Let's say product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. But then IR would show C=O peaks. But the NMR would have a singlet for the carbonyl groups, but the NMR data shows 4.79 (2H), which is more like a CH2 group attached to something electronegative.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol. But then the IR wouldn't have a strong carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the possibilities again. So the first reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely an elimination reaction. Each Br is in a position that can lose HBr. So two eliminations would form a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, which is a diene.

But then, the IR would show a peak around 1640-1680 cm⁻¹ for the C=C, but the given IR is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more like a carbonyl. So that's a problem. So maybe the first reaction isn't elimination but something else. Perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide? No, because the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So if it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination would form a double bond. But if it's a geminal dihalide, elimination would form a carbonyl. But 1,3 positions aren't geminal. So maybe I'm not right about the starting structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic dihalide, and elimination gives a carbonyl group. For example, in some cases, such as when dihalides are on adjacent carbons in a ring, elimination can form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, making it a vicinal dihalide. Then elimination would form an alkene, but the IR doesn't match that. So perhaps I'm wrong, and the product 1 is an epoxide. But then, KOH is not typically used for epoxide formation; epoxides are formed using other reagents like m-CPBA.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should think of product 1 as something else. The IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is strong, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Another possibility is that the product is a secondary alcohol, but the IR wouldn't have such a strong peak then.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. That would require the two Br atoms to be positioned in a way that elimination forms a carbonyl. Maybe the structure is such that the two Brs are on adjacent carbons but in a ring, leading to a conjugated diene or a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclo
