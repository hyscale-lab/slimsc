Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, with various combinations.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect. Oh right, because the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself when possible.

So, what are the fundamental symmetries of the Standard Model? Well, the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, which is the combination of rotations and boosts. Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one because all the particles and interactions are described in a relativistic framework. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Poincare symmetry is a bit different. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position in space and time). The Standard Model does respect Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. But wait, in SMEFT, when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they still respect Poincare? Because SMEFT is a effective theory valid below some cutoff scale. The effective theory should still include Poincare symmetry because the original model did. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) is also a must.

Now, about CP symmetry. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry in all of its aspects. For example, CP violation is observed in the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa (CKM) matrix in the weak interactions. So, operators in SMEFT might include terms that violate CP. Wait, but when building SMEFT, are all operators required to respect CP symmetry? I think not. Because the SM already allows for CP violation, SMEFT can also include operators that violate CP. So, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is probably not necessary.

Then there's CPT symmetry. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry, which is the combination of charge conjugation (C), parity (P), and time reversal (T). CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories that are Lorentz invariant. Since SMEFT is built to respect Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT. Because if a theory is Lorentz invariant, it must be CPT invariant. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry (option 4).

So putting it together: which symmetries must all operators respect? Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but wait a minute, Poincare symmetry includes translations. SMEFT operators include higher dimension terms, which are local but with higher derivatives or more fields. How does that affect Poincare? Well, Poincare includes momentum dependence, but SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it should still respect Poincare symmetry because it's part of the underlying structure. So options 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but wait, I thought that Poincare includes translations, which include momentum conservation. But in an effective theory, you can have non-renormalizable terms. For example, the operators are written as local terms, so they should still be compatible with Poincare. So yes, both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

But wait, another thought: in SMEFT, they usually say that the theory respects Lorentz symmetry, and hence also CPT. Poincare symmetry might automatically be included because the theory is written in a way that includes translations. Or does SMEFT not necessarily have to respect Poincare? Because SMEFT is an effective theory, perhaps the cutoff scale is where the effective theory breaks down, but below that, it should respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So Poincare should be respected.

So looking at the options, the correct combination would be 1,2, and 4. Wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D)1,3,4

Wait, option C is 1,2,4. That would include Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. Do all operators have to respect Poincare symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing Lorentz and Poincare. Because Poincare includes not just rotations and boosts (Lorentz) but also translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But if a theory respects Lorentz and is translationally invariant (which it must be for momentum conservation), then it's Poincare.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are local, so they should respect translations because they're written as local terms. So if they're local, they must respect Poincare symmetry.

But wait, in the SMEFT, the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which must be Lorentz invariant. So the Lagrangian is a scalar, which implies Lorentz invariance. But does that imply Poincare invariance? I think the Lagrangian is required to be invariant under Poincare, because the action (integral of the Lagrangian) must be invariant under spacetime translations. So yes, the Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant.

So, which symmetries must all operators respect? All operators in SMEFT must be part of a Poincare-invariant Lagrangian, so they must respect Poincare symmetry. Also, they must respect Lorentz symmetry (a subset of Poincare) but since Poincare is a larger symmetry, if an operator is Poincare invariant, it's automatically Lorentz invariant. Wait, but the question lists both 1 and 2 as options. So the question is whether both 1 and 2 are required. Because Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. But wait, the question is about the symmetries that must be respected by all operators, not the Lagrangian as a whole. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the operators don't have to respect Poincare symmetry individually, but when combined, the total Lagrangian is Poincare invariant. Because each operator could be a part of terms that might not be Poincare symmetric on their own, but the sum is. For example, say you have a term that is not Poincare invariant, but when added to another term, the total is. But that's not how it works. Each term in the Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant because the action has to be invariant.

Wait, each term in the Lagrangian must individually be Poincare invariant. Because each term is part of the integrand. So each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. Because otherwise, the integrand would change under translations, and the action wouldn't be invariant.

So, the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. But wait, if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So the question is, are all operators required to respect Poincare? Because Poincare is a larger symmetry, if an operator doesn't respect Poincare, it won't respect Lorentz either.

Wait, but another angle: SMEFT is constructed to have a Lagrangian that is Lorentz invariant but might not be Poincare invariant? No, that can't be right. The Lagrangian must be a scalar under Lorentz transformations, which makes it a Lorentz scalar. But for the action to be Poincare invariant, the Lagrangian must be Poincare invariant. So yes, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are of the form (1/Lambda^n) * operator, where operator is a Lorentz scalar. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar. But for the Lagrangian to be Poincare invariant, each term must be a Poincare scalar. So the operators must be Poincare scalars.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The Lagrangian must be a scalar under Poincare transformations. Because the action S = ∫d^4x L must be invariant under translations (which are part of Poincare). So the integrand must be a scalar density. So each term in the Lagrangian must transform as a scalar under Poincare. But scalar under Poincare implies it's a Lorentz scalar and a scalar under translations. So each operator must respect Poincare symmetry. So both 1 and 2 are required.

But wait, I'm a bit shaky on this. Another approach: what symmetries are explicitly broken in SMEFT?

In SMEFT, the main idea is that the theory is valid below the cutoff scale, and the SM fields are treated as massless. The operators are classified under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. So the operators must be Lorentz scalars. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. Also, because the theory includes all possible terms that are allowed by Lorentz and gauge symmetry, each operator must be a Lorentz scalar. But what about Poincare?

The SMEFT is part of a Poincare-invariant theory because the Standard Model is Poincare-invariant. So the effective theory must also be Poincare-invariant. Therefore, each operator must individually respect Poincare symmetry. Because if a term in the Lagrangian doesn't respect Poincare, the action won't be invariant.

Hence, both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries must be respected by all operators. Then, what about CPT?

CPT symmetry is automatically respected if the theory is Lorentz invariant. Because in quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. So, if all operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they automatically respect CPT. So option 4 must be respected as well.

So the required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the correct combination is options 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, that's option C (1,2,4). 

Wait, but wait again. The question says, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be invariant under these symmetries. So operator must be a scalar under Lorentz, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. Similarly, each operator must be a scalar under translations, meaning Poincare. And since the theory is Lorentz-invariant, CPT is automatically respected.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be a scalar under Lorentz, which requires that they respect Lorentz symmetry. Similarly, each operator must be a scalar under Poincare, but is that the case?

Alternatively, maybe in SMEFT, the operators don't have to individually respect Poincare symmetry, but the sum of the terms in the Lagrangian must. Because the Lagrangian as a whole must be Poincare-invariant. For example, each operator could have terms that are not Poincare invariant, but when you add them together, the total is. But I'm not sure if that's possible. Because each term in the Lagrangian must be a scalar, so each operator must be a scalar under Poincare. 

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT Lagrangian is required to be Poincare-invariant, meaning each term (operator) must be a scalar under Poincare. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry.

So the required symmetries are 1, 2, and 4.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer should be option C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model, which is a relativistic theory. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model, and hence SMEFT, is a relativistic theory. All operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry because the Lagrangian is required to be a scalar under Lorentz transformations. This ensures the theory is consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Lagrangian in SMEFT is constructed to be Poincaré-invariant, meaning each operator must individually respect Poincaré symmetry. This ensures the action, which is the integral of the Lagrangian, remains invariant under spacetime translations.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model does not strictly respect CP symmetry, as CP violation is observed in weak interactions (e.g., in the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix). SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry, so CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of relativistic quantum field theories. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT symmetry. This is a necessary condition for any Lorentz-invariant theory.

From this analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required, as SMEFT allows for CP-violating operators.

Thus, the correct combination of symmetries is **1, 2, and 4**, which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
