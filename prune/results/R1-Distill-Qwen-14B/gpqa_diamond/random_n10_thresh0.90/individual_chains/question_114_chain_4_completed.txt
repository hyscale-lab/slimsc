Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two reaction steps, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the given options. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

The options are A, B, C, D, each assigning different reagents for A and B.

Hmm, let me break this down. Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a nitrile like cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. So, ketones typically undergo addition reactions where the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If NaCN adds to the carbonyl, the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon, and then what happens? Usually, after the attack, the oxygen becomes an alkoxide and needs to get protonated.

So, the product would have the structure where the CO becomes a C-OH group, but wait, looking at the product: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Structure-wise, that would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe another arrangement. Wait, but wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When cyanide adds, the nitrile (CN-) attacks the carbonyl C, so the product becomes (CH3)2C(O-) Na+ and CN- would be attached. Then, what happens? The oxygen would have a negative charge, so it would get protonated. So, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, but the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write the structure of that.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents here. 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure CH2C(OH)(CH3)CH2CN? No, wait. Wait, butane is four carbons. 2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)CCH2CN. Wait, maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCN, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the fourth carbon, but wait, butane is four carbons. So, the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe I should number differently. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, because butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. So, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would be on the second carbon. So, the structure is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

Wait, but butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN. The addition would form (CH3)2C(O-)CN. But we need to protonate that. So, the reaction would probably produce (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh wait, but that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, right? Because (CH3)2C(OH)CN has three carbons in the main chain, so propanenitrile. Hmm, but the product is butanenitrile.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Oh, wait, perhaps I got the starting material wrong. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is three carbons. So product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile. Wait, but the product is butanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, maybe the starting material is butanone, but butan-2-one is correct. So the product after adding cyanide would have four carbons? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction conditions instead.

So, butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives the product. I'm pretty sure that the reaction of ketones with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst is a typical example of a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism would be: the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an alkoxide intermediate, which then gets protonated to form the alcohol and nitrile.

So, the reagent A would be an acid, because the protonation step requires an acid catalyst. But in some cases, the NaCN is a source of CN- and also, in some cases, HCN is generated, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, it's a typical example of a Henry reaction? Or is it the same as the addition of HCN? Oh right, HCN adds to ketones to form cyanohydrins. But in this case, we have NaCN, which is a source of CN-, but in a polar aprotic solvent, perhaps. Wait, but when you add NaCN to a ketone, it's a similar process: the CN- attacks the carbonyl, forms the alkoxide, which is then protonated. So the reagent would be an acid to provide the protons for the workup.

So, in the first reaction, the reagent A is probably an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A and B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D). Wait, but H3O+ is a strong acid, and NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a mild acid.

Wait, but in the first reaction, after the nucleophilic addition, the product is a cyanohydrin. The typical reaction conditions for forming a cyanohydrin involve using an acid as a catalyst. So, H3O+ would be the acid. But what about NaHSO3? It's a source of H+ as well, but perhaps it's used in a different context.

Alternatively, perhaps the first reaction uses HCN and a base, but that's not the case here because the reagent is NaCN.

Wait, to clarify: the reaction of a ketone with NaCN in aqueous solution would proceed via the cyanide ion acting as a nucleophile. The addition occurs, then you need to protonate the oxygen. So, perhaps the workup involves an acid. But sometimes, NaCN is used in a basic solution, but in this case, the product is an alcohol and a nitrile, so perhaps the reaction is in a slightly acidic condition.

Wait, but I think the first reaction is a typical acid-catalyzed addition. So, reagent A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So, options A and B are possibilities.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH) group.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. How is that done? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions to form carboxylic acids. The common methods are acidic hydrolysis or basic hydrolysis, followed by acid workup.

In acidic conditions, you typically use a strong acid like HCl, heat, and water. Alternatively, you can use H2SO4 as a catalyst. Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Or wait, the problem says "B (H2O)", so perhaps B is an acid in the presence of water.

Wait, the reaction is: 2-hydroxybutanenitrile → 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, nitrile to acid. The usual conditions are hydrolysis with strong acid and heat. So, using HCl (H2O and HCl) would be the typical way.

So, reagent B is HCl. Because in the second step, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid, which requires acidic conditions.

Looking back at the options, option A has B=HCl, option C has B=HCl as well. Wait, option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

So, if in the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+, and in the second, HCl, then the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but let me double-check. For the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (proton source), which makes sense for the protonation step in the cyanohydrin formation.

In the second reaction, the nitrile is converted to a carboxylic acid. So, under acidic conditions, perhaps using HCl in water (H2O as the solvent?), which would be the case.

So, with that, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So, the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but I should also consider other possibilities. For instance, sometimes NaHSO3 is used as an acid catalyst, but I don't think it would affect the second reaction, which requires a strong acid for hydrolysis.

Wait, another possibility: in the first reaction, could A be NaHSO3? Well, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ ions (since it dissociates into Na+ and HSO3^- which can donate a proton). So, it's a mild acid. So, perhaps in the first reaction, NaHSO3 could also work as the acid catalyst.

But if the first reaction uses NaHSO3, then what would happen? The product would still form the cyanohydrin, because the acid is present to protonate the oxygen.

So, if A were NaHSO3, then the product would form as well. So why is that an option?

Wait, but in the second reaction, the reagent is B, which is H2O. But in the options, option C and D have B as HCl and CH3COOH respectively.

Wait, no, the problem states that the second reaction uses B plus H2O. So, the reagent B is the acid. So, for the second reaction, B should be an acid—like HCl or CH3COOH.

So, in the second reaction, the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid would require an acidic condition. So, HCl is a strong acid, which is suitable. Alternatively, using acetic acid (CH3COOH) as a weak acid might not be strong enough, unless under reflux for a longer time.

Wait, but nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires strong acid and heat. So, perhaps HCl is the correct reagent for B.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (so B is HCl), then the correct option is option A.

But wait, option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. So, could NaHSO3 work for the first reaction?

Well, NaHSO3 is a weaker acid than H3O+, but it can still donate a proton. So, perhaps it can act as an acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. In that case, A would be NaHSO3, and B would be HCl.

So, would that be possible?

In the first reaction, the presence of NaHSO3 would provide H+ for the protonation. But I'm not certain if this is a common condition for forming cyanohydrins. Usually, I've read that the addition of HCN to ketones is done under acidic conditions, like H2SO4 as a catalyst. So, perhaps H3O+ is more appropriate, making option A the correct choice.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me think about the hydrolysis step again. If the second reaction uses HCl as B, then option A and C are possibilities (since both have B as HCl). But for A, options A and C have different reagents.

So, if in the first reaction, A is H3O+, then option A is correct, but if A is NaHSO3, then option C is correct.

But wait, the reagents in the first step: butan-2-one plus NaCN. So, the reaction is ketone + NaCN → cyanohydrin. The conditions for this reaction are typically in the presence of an acid. For example, HCN is used with a ketone under acidic conditions to form the cyanohydrin.

So, using NaCN as the nucleophile, perhaps in a solution where H+ is present. So, H3O+ would be a source of H+.

Alternatively, sodium cyanide is a strong base, so maybe the solution is slightly basic. Wait, but the product requires an acidic workup to protonate the oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is done in a basic solution, but then an acid is added to protonate the product. But in the problem statement, the reagent A is added along with NaCN. So, perhaps A is the acid required to protonate.

Wait, if I think about the typical procedure: you have the ketone, then add HCN, which is usually a gas, so in solution, perhaps HCN is bubbled into the solution. But in this case, NaCN is a salt, which would provide CN- in solution, but without H+.

So, to make the solution acidic, perhaps H3O+ is added as reagent A. So, the first reaction would proceed under acidic conditions, with H3O+.

In the second reaction, the nitrile group is converted to a carboxylic acid. So, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions, which typically uses HCl (H2O and HCl) as the reagent. So, B is HCl.

So, that would point to option A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but looking at the product of the first reaction: 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The butanenitrile part suggests four carbons, but butan-2-one is three. So, perhaps butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product is butanenitrile. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But in the product, the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl and methyl groups. So, the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, that would be four carbons, making it butane. So, butan-2-one (3 carbons) becomes a four-carbon molecule. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, and adding CN gives (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, which is a three-carbon nitrile. But the product in the question is butanenitrile, four carbons.

Ah, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, but that's four carbons. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? That would have four carbons, making it butanenitrile. So, butan-2-one (3 carbons) plus CN adds to make a four-carbon product. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a different mechanism, but I think I'm getting stuck on this. Maybe I should refocus on the reagents.

So, given that I'm confident the second reaction requires HCl as B, looking at the options:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl → Correct for both steps.

Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl → NaHSO3 is a milder acid. Could that work for the first step?

In the first step, the reaction of NaCN with ketone under mild acid (NaHSO3) would proceed as well. So, perhaps both A and C could be possible for the first reaction. But which one is correct?

Wait, the product in the first reaction is a cyanohydrin, which is formed under acidic conditions. So, H3O+ is a strong acid, which would definitely work. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ but is a weaker acid. So, would the reaction proceed under NaHSO3? I think it would, but perhaps H3O+ is the better choice.

Looking back at the options, if I choose option A, then the answer is correct.

So, putting it all together, the reagents would be A = H3O+, B = HCl, which is option A.


The question involves two reactions, and the goal is to identify the correct reagents A and B from the given options. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction 1:  
**Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile**  
- Butan-2-one is a ketone, and NaCN provides the cyanide ion (CN⁻), which acts as a nucleophile.  
- The reaction is a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin.  
- After the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, the oxygen is deprotonated and requires an acid catalyst for protonation to form the final product.  
- Reagent A must be an acid to facilitate protonation. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a strong acid) is the most suitable for this step.  

### Reaction 2:  
**2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H₂O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid**  
- This reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (CN) to a carboxylic acid (COOH).  
- Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as HCl in water.  
- Reagent B must be a strong acid like HCl to ensure the reaction proceeds efficiently.  

### Evaluation of Options:  
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction as an acid catalyst. HCl is suitable for the second reaction as a strong acid for nitrile hydrolysis.  
  - This option is consistent with both reactions.  

- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction. However, CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid and may not be strong enough for the nitrile hydrolysis in the second reaction.  
  - This option is less likely.  

- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ is a mild acid and can act as a catalyst for the first reaction. However, HCl is suitable for the second reaction.  
  - While this option is plausible, H₃O⁺ is a stronger acid and more commonly used for the first reaction.  

- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is a mild acid and could work for the first reaction. However, CH₃COOH is a weak acid and insufficient for the second reaction.  
  - This option is incorrect.  

### Conclusion:  
The most suitable reagents are **A = H₃O⁺** for the first reaction and **B = HCl** for the second reaction, as provided in **Option A**.
