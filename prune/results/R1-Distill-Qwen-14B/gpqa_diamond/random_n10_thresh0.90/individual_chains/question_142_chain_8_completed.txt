Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question gives me a specific density matrix:

ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)

I need to figure out where this is located geometrically in the qubit space. The options are points in 3D space, like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc.

Wait, I think qubits can be represented in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of a qubit's state. Pure states are points on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But how does the density matrix relate to that?

Oh right, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (the Bloch vector) and σ are the Pauli matrices. So the components of r correspond to the expectation values in the x, y, z directions.

Let me write down the general form:

ρ = (I/2) + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2

So for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, the Bloch vector has length 1, but for mixed states, it's shorter. In this case, the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute this.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, so in matrix form, |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2) * I, since I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So ρ = I/2.

Now, let's compare this with the general form. The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So setting them equal:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

I = I + r·σ

Subtract I from both sides:

0 = r·σ

Which implies that the Bloch vector r is zero because r·σ equals zero only when r is zero. Because if r is non-zero, then r·σ would be a matrix with some non-zero elements, which can't equal the zero matrix.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0), which corresponds to the completely mixed state. That makes sense because a completely mixed state has no coherence and equal probabilities for |0⟩ and |1⟩. So in the Bloch sphere, this would be the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. Comparing this with the general form of a single-qubit density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\):

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z}{2},
\]

we see that the Bloch vector \(r\) must satisfy:

\[
r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z = 0.
\]

This implies that \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\), meaning the Bloch vector is at the origin. Geometrically, this corresponds to the completely mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

\[
r = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Answer: C
