Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, which binds metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed when Ca²+ ions bind with EDTA^4- ions. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong this complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, does that mean the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in the solution?

Yes, because once the complex forms, the free ion concentration would depend on the dissociation of the complex. The formula for the formation constant is K = [Ca-EDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, in solution, the EDTA is usually in the form of HnY, depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says pH is ideal, so I think we can assume that all EDTA is in the form of Y^4-.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA, which is the formation constant for the complex. So when you have the complex CaY²− (since EDTA is Y^4- and Ca²+ gives Y^4- + Ca²+ → CaY^2-, right?), the formation constant is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

But in the solution, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, we think [CaY^2-] is 0.02 M. But wait, the solution might not be in pure water, and we also have to consider that the EDTA and Ca²+ concentrations are coming from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, without considering dissociation, [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. But the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and Y^4−. So at equilibrium, some of the CaY²− will dissociate, contributing to [Ca²+] and [Y^4−].

But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M in the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stochiometric implies that the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA are exactly in the ratio required to form the complex. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are zero, and all comes from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, no. No, stochiometric usually refers to the molar ratio when the complex is formed. So when you have a 1:1 ratio between Ca²+ and EDTA, the complex [CaY²−] forms. So in the solution, if you have 0.02 M of the complex, then without any dissociation, the concentrations would be [Ca²+] = 0.02 M, [Y^4−] = 0.02 M, and [CaY²−] = 0.02 M? No, wait, no. Wait, the complex is formed from Ca²+ and EDTA. So if the complex is 0.02 M, that would mean that in solution, without any dissociation, [Ca²+] would be 0.02 M and [Y^4−] would be 0.02 M, but that's only if the complex is fully dissociated. But the complex doesn't dissociate completely because K is very large (5e10), so K is a big number, which means the complex is very stable, so the dissociation is minimal.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the complex is present at 0.02 M. So the initial situation is that [CaY²−] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [Y^4−] are zero? No, that can't be. Because when you form the complex, you combine Ca²+ and EDTA to make the complex. So if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be zero, but the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. So at equilibrium, the concentration of the complex will be 0.02 - x, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA will be x each (assuming 1:1 ratio). But considering that K is so large (5e10), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because K is large, the complex is stable, so x is very small. So [Ca²+] ≈ x, which is very small.

So the formation constant K is given by K = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]). So substituting in our approximate values: 5e10 ≈ (0.02) / (x * x). Because [CaY²−] is 0.02, and [Ca²+] = [Y^4−] = x.

So, 5e10 = 0.02 / (x²). Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 = 4e-14.

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Wait, let me compute that again.

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x is the square root of 4e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and square root of 1e-12 is 1e-6. So x = 2e-6? Wait, wait, no: 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5? Wait, no, sqrt(1e-13) is (1e-13)^(1/2) = 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, but 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-13
