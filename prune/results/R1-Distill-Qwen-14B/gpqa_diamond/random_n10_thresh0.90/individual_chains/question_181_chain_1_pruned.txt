Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos coming from the Sun. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll do my best.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, right, that's about the time it takes for light (or neutrinos?) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So the neutrinos we detect now would be the ones emitted after this event. Interesting.

So, the pp-III branch is one of the proton-proton chains in the Sun's core. The pp process is the main way the Sun generates energy. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, I think, which produces helium-4. The pp-II and pp-III branches are less significant but still contribute. Oh wait, but this question is about pp-III stopping, so whatever neutrinos come from this process would stop.

I remember that the pp-III branch involves higher energy reactions, producing heavier elements like carbon-12. But wait, no, the main pp-I produces helium-4 and emits neutrinos, right? Oh, wait, no—actually, the proton-proton chain's main branch (pp-I) leads to helium-4 and produces neutrinos as part of the process. The pp-II and pp-III branches might involve different pathways, maybe producing boron or other elements, but I'm not sure how they contribute to neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the Sun primarily via the pp chain, specifically when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, which emits a neutrino. So the main source of solar neutrinos is the pp-I chain, which produces a lot of neutrinos. If the pp-III branch stopped, would that affect the neutrino flux?

Hmm. Let me think. The pp-III branch—I think it's a side reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form carbon-4, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe pp-III is another step in the chain leading to helium-4, but perhaps a minor contributor compared to pp-I.
