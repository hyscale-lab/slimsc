Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The problem says it's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the K for the Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, which I guess means that the EDTA is in its correct protonated form for binding Ca²+.

Hmm, wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, right? The formula is probably CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. But wait, when EDTA binds Ca²+, it's a 1:1 complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10. That's a really large K, so the complex is very stable. That makes sense because EDTA is a strong chelating agent.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaEDTA²- is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

In such complexes, the dissociation can be considered. So the total concentration of the complex (let's call it C_total) is 0.02 M. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

I think the formula to use here is the one for the formation constant. The K is given by [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA²-] = K.

Wait, wait, no. Because K is the formation constant, which is the reverse of the dissociation. So for the dissociation, the K would be 1/K_form. So the dissociation constant Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the dissociation reaction is: CaEDTA²- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

The expression for Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA²-] = 2e-11.

But the problem is that in solution, the total concentration of EDTA comes from the dissociation. Wait, wait, but the initial solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-. So the initial EDTA is all bound as the complex. So, when it dissociates, some of the complex breaks into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me define x as the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, because each mole of complex gives one mole of each. And [CaEDTA²-] would then be 0.02 - x.

But wait, given that Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x is approximately 0.02.

So the equation becomes x * x / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Which is x² = (2e-11) * 0.02.

Let me calculate that: 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, the square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7.

Wait, but wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another approach: the concentration of Ca²+ is given by sqrt(Kd * C_total). Because Kd is [Ca²+][EDTA] / [Complex]. Since [Ca²+] = [EDTA], because each complex releases one of each, and assuming that x is much smaller than 0.02.

So [Ca²+] = sqrt(Kd * C_total).

Kd is 2e-11, C_total is 0.02 M. So 2e-11 * 0.02 is 4e-13. sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 6.32e-7. So yes, option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_d \) is related to the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} \) by:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}}
\]

Given \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), we calculate:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}
\]

The total concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]_{\text{total}} = 0.02 \, \text{M} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x, \quad [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 - x
\]

Since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.02 \), so \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \). The equilibrium expression becomes:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}
\]

Substituting:

\[
K_d = \frac{x^2}{0.02}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = K_d \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
