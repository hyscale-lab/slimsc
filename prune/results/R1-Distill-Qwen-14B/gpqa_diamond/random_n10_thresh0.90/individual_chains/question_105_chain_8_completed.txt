Okay, I need to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

So the situation is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler. The question is about how the brightness variation caused by these spots compares to the variation caused by a planet. If the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same brightness change?

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I think is delta F = (Rp / Rstar)^2, since it's the area that matters. So if Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius, the fractional change in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Now, the star in the question has spots. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is covered. But wait, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away, causing a change in brightness.

The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The star's Teff is 6000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K. The brightness variation would be due to the spots being less bright than the surrounding areas.

Wait, is the star's brightness a sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas? So each spot contributes less light. When the spots rotate into view, the total brightness decreases.

So the total brightness variation from the spots would depend on the area of the spots and the temperature difference. The flux from the star is normally F = sigma * Teff^4 * (surface area). When spots are present, each spot contributes F_spot = sigma * (Teff - delta T)^4. So the change in flux would be the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area between spot and normal.

But wait, the problem says that the situation can 'resemble the presence of an exoplanet'. So the brightness variation amplitude from the spots is being compared to that from a planet.

So the question is: what planet radius would give the same brightness change as the spotted star, if the star wasn't spotted.

Wait no, actually, the question says: if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude (i.e., same brightness variation)?

So I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

But wait, perhaps it's the other way around. The spotted star would have a certain variation amplitude, and we need to find the planet radius that gives the same amplitude as if the star was unspotted. Or wait, the question is, "if the star was not covered by spots, what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude."

Wait, the problem states: "As only one hemisphere is spotty, photometric time-series observations will reveal periodic variations in brightness due to rotational modulation. Interestingly, this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet."

So the star's brightness varies as spots rotate into view. The question is, if the star wasn't spotted (so no spots), what planet radius would cause the same brightness variation as the star's spot-induced variation.

Wait, no. The question says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)" So, the star's actual light curve, which is due to the spots, has a certain amplitude. We need to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude if the star was not spotted. So, the spot-induced variation is considered as the 'signal', and we're to find the planet radius that would create the same signal.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the brightness variations.

Let me think about the star's brightness variation due to the spots. The star's brightness without spots is F0. When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the observed brightness is F = F0 - F_spots.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4π Rstar^2 / 2) ) = 0.2 * 2 π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar²? Wait, no. Wait, each hemisphere is 2π R². So one hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is 20%, so the area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

Wait, no. Wait, the total surface area of the star is 4π R². One hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

Each spot's temperature is 5000 K. The flux from a spot is sigma * (5000)^4 per unit area. The flux from the same area on the unspotted star would be sigma*(6000)^4. So the delta F per unit area is sigma*(6000^4 -5000^4).

So the total delta F for all spots is (area of spots) * sigma*(6000^4 -5000^4) = 0.4 π R² * sigma (6000^4 -5000^4).

But wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So the maximum variation would be when the spots are on the far side (not visible) or when they are on the near side.

Wait, no. Wait, the spots are on one hemisphere. When the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, we see the spots. When it's on the other side, we don't.

So the maximum brightness is when no spots are visible (the unspotted area is all we see). The minimum brightness is when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, so we see all the spots.

So the change in brightness is the delta F as calculated above.

Wait, no. Because when the spots are on the near side, the total flux is lower. So the maximum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side (all unspotted area is visible), and the minimum when it's on the near side (some spots are visible).

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

Wait, or is it the fractional change? Let me think in terms of relative flux.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

With spots, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F = F0 - F_spots.

So F_spots is the total flux lost due to the spots.

F_spots = 0.2 * (hemisphere area) * sigma (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ?

Wait, no. Each spot's area contributes sigma T_spot^4 per unit area. The unspotted area contributes sigma Teff^4.

Wait, the entire spotty hemisphere has 20% of its area as spots. So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is (0.2 * A_spots) * sigma T_spot^4 + (0.8 * A_spots) * sigma T_eff^4, where A_spots is the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, no. Each spot's area is part of the hemisphere. So the flux from the hemisphere would be:

Flux = sigma * [0.2 * (T_spot^4) + 0.8 * (T_eff^4)] * (Area of hemisphere).

Wait, no. The hemisphere area is 2 pi R².

So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F_spot_visible = sigma * [0.2 * T_spot^4 + 0.8 * T_eff^4] * 2 pi R².

The total flux without any spots (unspotted star) is F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * 4 pi R².

Wait, no. Alternatively, the star's flux is the sum of all the surface areas. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is:

Flux = (Flux from unspotted hemisphere) + (Flux from spotty hemisphere) 

But wait, the star's total surface is divided into two hemispheres. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is:

Flux_visible = (unspotted hemisphere flux) + (spotty hemisphere flux)

The unspotted hemisphere contributes 0.8 * 2 pi R² (since only 80% of the hemisphere is unspotted? No, wait. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the spots on the spotty hemisphere. So 20% of the spotty hemisphere is spots, so 80% is unspotted. So the spotty hemisphere's flux is:

sigma * (0.2 T_spot^4 + 0.8 T_eff^4) * 2 pi R^2.

The other hemisphere (unspotty) is 100% unspotted, but it's the other side, so it's 2 pi R^2 * sigma T_eff^4.

So total flux when spotty hemisphere is visible is:

F_spot_visible = [2 pi R² sigma (0.2 T_spot^4 + 0.8 T_eff^4)] + [2 pi R² sigma T_eff^4].

Wait, but is the unspotty hemisphere fully unspotted? Yes, because only one hemisphere is spotty. So the other hemisphere is entirely normal.

So F_spot_visible = 2 pi R² sigma (0.2 * (5000)^4 + 0.8 * (6000)^4 ) + 2 pi R² sigma (6000)^4.

Wait, but the entire star's flux when all is unspotted is 4 pi R^2 sigma (6000)^4. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is (as above).

But let me calculate F_spot_visible.

F_spot_visible = 2 pi R² sigma (0.2 * 5000^4 + 0.8 * 6000^4) + 2 pi R² sigma (6000^4).

Wait, no. Wait, the two hemispheres are each 2 pi R². The spotty hemisphere contributes 2 pi R² times the average flux of that hemisphere. The unspotty hemisphere contributes its full flux.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total flux as the sum of the two hemispheres.

Total flux when spotty hemisphere is visible: F = F_spotty_hemi + F_unspotty_hemi.

F_spotty_hemi = 2 pi R² sigma [0.2 * (5000^4) + 0.8 * (6000^4)].

F_unspotty_hemi = 2 pi R² sigma (6000^4).

So F = 2 pi R² sigma [0.2 *5000^4 +0.8 *6000^4 + 6000^4 ]

= 2 pi R² sigma [0.2 *5000^4 + (0.8 + 1) * 6000^4 ].

Wait, 0.8 + 1? No, the spotty hemisphere is 2 pi R², and the unspotty is another 2 pi R². So:

F = [2 pi R² sigma (0.2 5e3^4 + 0.8 6e3^4)] + [2 pi R² sigma 6e3^4 ]

Factor out 2 pi R² sigma:

F = 2 pi R² sigma [ 0.2 (5e3)^4 + 0.8 (6e3)^4 + (6e3^4) ].

Wait, that can't be right. Because the unspotty hemisphere's flux is 6e3^4 * 2 pi R². Oh wait, no: the unspotty hemisphere is the other side, so it's 2 pi R² * sigma (6e3)^4.

So F = (spotty_hemi_flux) + (unspotty_hemi_flux).

Spotty_hemi_flux = 2 pi R² sigma [0.2 (5e3^4) + 0.8 (6e3^4)].

Unspotty_hemi_flux = 2 pi R² sigma (6e3^4).

So F = 2 pi R² sigma [0.2 (5e3^4) + 0.8 (6e3^4) + 6e3^4 ].

Wait, no. The spotty hemisphere's flux is 0.2*(5e3^4) + 0.8*(6e3^4), all multiplied by 2 pi R^2 sigma.

The unspotty hemisphere's flux is 6e3^4, multiplied by 2 pi R^2 sigma.

So when you add them, you have:

F = (2 pi R² sigma) [0.2*(5e3)^4 + 0.8*(6e3)^4 + (6e3)^4 ].

Wait no, I think I made a mistake. The spotty hemisphere's flux is:

spotty_hemi = 2 pi R² * sigma * [0.2*(5000^4) + 0.8*(6000^4)].

unspotty_hemi = 2 pi R² * sigma * (6000^4).

So F_total = spotty_hemi + unspotty_hemi.

= 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.2 *5e3^4 + 0.8 *6e3^4 + 6e3^4 ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma [0.2 *5e3^4 + (0.8 + 1) *6e3^4 ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.2*(5e3^4) + 1.8*(6e3^4) ].

But the star's total flux when unspotted is F0 = 4 pi R² sigma (6e3^4).

So F0 is when both hemispheres are at 6e3 K. Let me compute F_spot_visible and F0.

Compute F_spot_visible / F0.

F_spot_visible = 2 pi R^2 sigma [0.2*(5e3)^4 + 1.8*(6e3)^4 ].

F0 = 4 pi R² sigma (6e3)^4.

So F_spot_visible / F0 = [2 pi R² sigma (0.2*(5e3)^4 + 1.8*(6e3)^4 ) ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma (6e3)^4 ].

Simplify:

= [ (0.2*(5e3)^4 + 1.8*(6e3)^4 ) ] / [ 2*(6e3)^4 ]

Calculate numerator and denominator:

First, compute 5e3^4 and 6e3^4.

5e3 =5000, 5e3^4 = (5^4) *1e12 = 625e12.

Similarly, 6e3^4 = (6^4) *1e12 = 1296e12.

Compute 0.2 * 5e3^4 = 0.2 * 625e12 = 125e12.

1.8 *6e3^4 = 1.8 *1296e12 = 2332.8e12.

Sum of numerator =125e12 +2332.8e12 =2457.8e12.

Denominator: 2 *1296e12 =2592e12.

So F_spot_visible / F0 = 2457.8e12 / 2592e12 = 2457.8 /2592 ≈ 0.948.

So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is about 94.8% of the maximum (unspotted) flux.

Wait, but wait. The maximum flux is when the unspotty hemisphere is facing us, right? Because when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side, the entire star is unspotted (from our view), so F_max = F0.

The minimum flux is when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, so F_spot_visible.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, no. The variation amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max, which is the fractional change in brightness.

Wait, no, perhaps it's (F_max - F_min)/F_max, or maybe (F_max - F_min)/F0, but F0 is the unspotted flux.

Wait, F_max is when the star's unspotty hemisphere is visible, so F_max = F0. F_min is when spotty hemisphere is visible, which we found as approximately 0.948 F0.

So the delta F = F_max - F_min = F0 - 0.948 F0 = 0.052 F0.

The amplitude is delta F / F0 = 0.052, which is 5.2%.

Wait, but is that the case? Because when the star rotates, the brightness varies between F0 (when unspotty) and 0.948 F0 (when spotty is visible).

So (F0 - 0.948 F0)/F0 = 0.052 =5.2% variation.

Now, the planet's transit would cause a similar variation. The planet's signal is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we need (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.052.

So Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(0.052) ≈ sqrt(0.05) is about 0.2236. 0.052 is a bit bigger. Let me compute sqrt(0.052).

Compute sqrt(0.052):

0.052 =52 *1e-3=52e-3.

sqrt(52)=7.211, so sqrt(52e-3)=sqrt(52)*sqrt(1e-3)=7.211 * 0.03162 ≈ 0.228.

So about 0.228.

But wait, wait. Wait, the amplitude from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's light, so the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So in this case, the fractional change from the spots is 0.052, and the planet's fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2 =0.052.

So Rp = Rstar * sqrt(0.052) ≈ Rstar *0.228.

Looking at the options:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39²≈0.15>0.052 → too big.

B) ~0.07 → 0.07²=0.0049 → too small.

C) ~0.11 →0.0121 → too small.

D) ~0.32 →0.32²=0.1024 → bigger than 0.052.

Wait, none of the options match 0.228. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the approach.

Alternative approach.

The variation due to the spots is the difference in brightness when the spots are visible versus not.

The brightness change can be modeled as the sum of the unspotted and spotted areas.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the fractional change in brightness between when the spots are on the far side (max brightness) and when they're on the near side (min brightness).

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the star's brightness as the sum of all the spots and unspotted areas.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the difference between the all-unspotted flux (F0) and the flux when the spots are visible (F_spot_visible).

As we computed, F_spot_visible was about 0.948 F0, so the change is 5.2% of F0.

So the amplitude is 5.2%.

If a planet transiting would cause a dip of 5.2%, then the planet's area would be 5.2% of the star's area.

Wait, no, because the planet blocks a part of the star's light, so the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.052.

So Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.052) ≈ 0.228, which is approximately 0.23. But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the situation when only one hemisphere is spotty. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view for a certain period. So the maximum variation is when the spot is fully visible, and the minimum when it's not.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the brightness variation amplitude correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the brightness variation due to spots.

The formula for the brightness variation when a star has active regions (spots) is given by:

ΔF = (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Where F_unspotted is the flux when no spots are visible, and F_spotted is the flux when spots are visible.

But in this case, the star's total flux when no spots are visible is when the spotty hemisphere is on the far side (so F0 is the same as when unspotted).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the difference in flux when the spots are present on the hemisphere we're viewing.

Wait, another approach: the star's total flux when half of it is spotted (but only one hemisphere is spotted) is:

F_spotty = (A_unspotted * F_unspotted + A_spotted * F_spotted) / A_total.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the unspotted and spotted regions.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate the relative change in flux.

The relative change in flux is the difference between the total flux when the spots are on the far side (F_max = F0) and when the spots are on the near side (F_min).

So F_max = F0.

F_min = F0 - (filling factor * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * area of hemisphere / (sigma * 4 pi Rstar^2) )).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

The total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_min = ( (1 - filling factor) * Teff^4 + filling factor * T_spot^4 ) * ( surface area of the hemisphere ) / (sigma * 4 pi Rstar^2) ) * sigma * 4 pi Rstar^2.

Wait, perhaps going back to the basics.

The star emits a total flux F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi Rstar^2.

When the spots are visible, the total flux is F = F0 - delta F, where delta F is the difference in flux from spots and surrounding areas.

The area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere. Each spot has a lower temperature. So the delta F is:

delta F = (F_unspotted_area - F_spotted_area) = (sigma Teff^4 * A_spots) - (sigma T_spot^4 * A_spots).

= sigma A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4).

So the fractional change is delta F / F0 = [ sigma A_spots (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / (sigma 4 pi Rstar^2 Teff^4 )

A_spots is 0.2 * 2 pi Rstar^2 = 0.4 pi Rstar^2.

So,

delta F / F0 = [ 0.4 pi Rstar^2 (6e3^4 -5e3^4) ] / [4 pi Rstar^2 *6e3^4 ]

Simplify:

= [0.4 (6e3^4 -5e3^4) ] / [4 *6e3^4 ]

= [0.1 (6e3^4 -5e3^4) ] / [6e3^4 ]

Compute 6e3^4 = 6^4 *1e12 = 1296e12.

5e3^4=625e12.

So 6e3^4 -5e3^4=671e12.

So,

delta F / F0 = [0.1 * 671e12 ] / [1296e12 ] = (67.1e12) / (1296e12 )= 67.1 /1296 ≈ 0.05175.

Which is approximately 5.175% change.

So the fractional change is about 5.175%.

This is the amplitude of the brightness variation due to the spots.

Now, for a planet to cause the same amplitude, the dip should be the same.

The dip from a planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05175 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05175) ≈ 0.2275.

Which is approximately 0.23.

Looking at the options, none of them exactly match. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~0.39 → ~0.15, which is higher than 0.05.

B) ~0.07 → ~0.0049 → too small.

C) ~0.11 → ~0.0121 → too small.

D) ~0.32 → 0.32²=0.1024 → higher than 0.05175.

Hmm. None of the options exactly match 0.23. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the dip, but about the same amplitude in the light curve. So perhaps the maximum brightness variation is when the spot is entering/leaving the view, leading to a certain slope, but that's probably more complex than necessary.

Wait, perhaps the star's brightness variation is not a dip but a modulation that's half of the planet's dip, because the planet would cause a dip, while the star's variation is a dip and a rise as the spots come into view and then go away.

Wait, but the amplitude is the maximum change, so it's 5% as calculated.

So why do the options not include 0.23? Let me check the given options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) ~0.39 → 0.39^2=0.15 → 15% dip.

B) ~0.07 → 0.49% dip.

C) ~0.11 → 1.21% dip.

D) ~0.32 → 10.24% dip.

Hmm, none of these match the 5.175% dip.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering which hemisphere is being viewed.

Wait, another thought: when the star is viewed with one hemisphere spotty, the flux is F = F0 * [ (1 - filling factor) * (Teff^4/T0) + filling factor * (T_spot^4/T0) ) ]^{1/4}.

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, the flux from the star's surface is proportional to T^4 per unit area. So the total flux is the sum of all the areas multiplied by their T^4.

Wait, perhaps the total flux when the spots are visible is F = (unspotted area fraction * Teff^4 + spotted area fraction * T_spot^4) multiplied by the surface area.

Wait, but the star's total flux is F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2.

When the spots are visible, the flux is:

F = [ (1 - filling factor) * Teff^4 + filling factor * T_spot^4 ] * 4 pi R^2 sigma.

So the relative flux is F / F0 = [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] / Teff^4.

Where f is the filling factor on the hemisphere, which is 0.2.

So F / F0 = (1 - 0.2) + 0.2 * (T_spot^4 / Teff^4 )

= 0.8 + 0.2*(5000/6000)^4.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4.

0.8333^2 ≈ 0.6944, squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So 0.2 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.09646.

So F / F0 = 0.8 + 0.09646 = 0.89646.

So the flux when the spots are visible is 89.646% of F0.

The maximum flux is F0, when the spots are on the far side, and the minimum is 0.89646 F0 when the spots are on the near side.

So the amplitude (maximum variation) is (F0 - F_spot_visible ) / F0 = (1 -0.89646) = 0.10354 → 10.354% variation.

Wait, this is different from the previous calculation. So now I'm getting a 10.35% dip, which would correspond to (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.3217.

Which is close to option D) 0.32.

So why the discrepancy? Earlier, I thought the spots cover one hemisphere, so the area was 20% of that hemisphere. But perhaps the calculation is that when the spotty hemisphere is viewed, the entire area is considered, not just the spots.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the brightness when the spotty hemisphere is facing us. So the entire hemisphere contributes its flux, which is a mix of spotted and unspotted areas.

So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty_hemi = sigma * [ (1 - f) * Teff^4 + f * T_spot^4 ] * 2 pi R^2.

The other hemisphere is unspotty, so its flux is F_unspotty_hemi = sigma Teff^4 * 2 pi R^2.

So total flux F = F_spotty_hemi + F_unspotty_hemi.

= sigma 2 pi R^2 [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 + Teff^4 ].

= sigma 2 pi R^2 [ (2 -f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

The total flux without any spots (F0) is sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2.

So F / F0 = [ sigma 2 pi R^2 ( (2 -f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] / [ sigma 4 pi R^2 Teff^4 ) ].

Simplify:

= [ (2-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] / [ 2 Teff^4 ].

= [ (2 -f) + f (T_spot^4 / Teff^4) ) ] / 2.

Plugging in f=0.2, T_spot=5000, Teff=6000.

Compute T_spot^4 / Teff^4 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.482253.

So,

[ (2 -0.2) + 0.2 * 0.482253 ] / 2.

= [1.8 + 0.09645 ] / 2.

= (1.89645)/2 = 0.948225.

So F = F0 * 0.948225.

So the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is 94.82% of F0.

The maximum flux is F0, when the unspotty hemisphere is visible. Wait, no. Because the other hemisphere is unspotty, but when the spotty is on the near side, the unspotty is on the far side.

Wait, no. The star's other hemisphere is always unspotty because only one hemisphere has spots. So when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, the unspotty is on the far side, but you can't see the far side. So when the star is viewed with the spotty hemisphere, the flux is F = F_spotty_hemi + F_unspotty_hemi.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The star has two hemispheres: one spotty (with 20% spots, 80% unspotty) and one completely unspotty.

When the spotty hemisphere is on the near side (visible to us), the flux is the sum of the spotty hemisphere's flux and the unspotty hemisphere's flux.

Wait, no, because the unspotty hemisphere is on the far side. So from our viewpoint, we can't see the unspotty hemisphere when the spotty is visible. Wait, no. The star is a sphere, so when you see it, you're seeing all the areas that are on the near side. So when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, you see the spotty hemisphere's surface. The unspotty hemisphere is on the far side, so you don't see any of it.

Wait, that makes more sense. So when the spotty hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is just the flux from the spotty hemisphere.

When the unspotty hemisphere is on the near side, the flux is just the flux from the unspotty hemisphere.

So F_max is the flux from the unspotty hemisphere: F_unspotty_hemi = sigma Teff^4 * 2 pi R^2.

F_min is the flux from the spotty hemisphere: F_spotty_hemi = sigma [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ] * 2 pi R^2.

So F_max = F0 * (2 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4 ) / (4 pi R^2 sigma Teff^4) ) = F0 * (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = F0 * 0.5.

Wait, that can't be right because F0 is the total flux when the entire star is unspotty, which would be when both hemispheres are unspotty. But in this case, one hemisphere is spotty, so the maximum flux is when the unspotty hemisphere is viewed, which is F_unspotty_hemi.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio F_unspotty_hemi / F0.

F_unspotty_hemi = sigma Teff^4 * 2 pi R^2.

F0 = sigma Teff^4 * 4 pi R^2.

So F_unspotty_hemi / F0 = (2 pi R^2) / (4 pi R^2) ) = 0.5.

So F_max is 0.5 F0.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when the entire star is viewed, F0 is 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

But if you have one hemisphere viewed, it's 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4, which is half of F0.

So when the unspotty hemisphere is viewed, the flux is F_max = 0.5 F0.

When the spotty hemisphere is viewed, the flux is F_spotty_hemi = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ (1-f) Teff^4 + f T_spot^4 ].

So F_min = F_spotty_hemi = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.8 *6e3^4 + 0.2 *5e3^4 ].

Which is 2 pi R^2 sigma [ 0.8*(1296e12) + 0.2*(625e12) ) ].

Compute inside: 0.8*1296e12 = 1036.8e12, 0.2*625e12=125e12. Sum: 1161.8e12.

So F_spotty_hemi = 2 pi R^2 sigma * 1161.8e12.

F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma *1296e12.

So F_spotty_hemi / F0 = [2 pi R² sigma * 1161.8e12 ] / [4 pi R² sigma *1296e12 ].

Simplify:

= (2 *1161.8e12 ) / (4 *1296e12 )

= (2323.6e12) / (5184e12) ≈ 2323.6 /5184 ≈ 0.447.

So F_min is approximately 0.447 F0.

F_max is 0.5 F0.

So the amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max = (0.5 F0 - 0.447 F0 ) / 0.5 F0 )= (0.053 F0 ) / 0.5 F0 = 0.106 → 10.6% variation.

So the amplitude is about 10.6%.

So for a planet to cause the same amplitude, (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.106 → Rp/Rstar≈0.325.

Which is approximately 0.33. Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32, which is close.

So the answer would be option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius: Same as the Sun.  
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.  
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).  

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux is reduced due to the cooler spots.  
   - The flux from the spotty hemisphere is calculated as:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spotty}} = \sigma \left[ (1 - f) T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right] \cdot 2 \pi R_{\star}^2
     \]  
     where \( f = 0.2 \) is the filling factor.  
   - The unspotty hemisphere contributes flux:  
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotty}} = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \cdot 2 \pi R_{\star}^2
     \]  
   - The total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{total}} = F_{\text{spotty}} + F_{\text{unspotty}}
     \]  
   - The maximum flux (\( F_{\text{max}} \)) occurs when the unspotty hemisphere is visible, and the minimum flux (\( F_{\text{min}} \)) occurs when the spotty hemisphere is visible.  

3. **Amplitude of Brightness Variation**:  
   - The amplitude is the fractional change in flux:  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \frac{F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}}}{F_{\text{max}}}
     \]  
   - Using the given temperatures and filling factor, the amplitude is calculated to be approximately **10.6%**.

4. **Exoplanet Signal**:  
   - The brightness variation caused by a transiting exoplanet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\star}} \right)^2
     \]  
   - To match the amplitude of 10.6%, the planet radius must satisfy:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\star}} \right)^2 = 0.106
     \]  
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\star}} \):  
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{pl}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.106} \approx 0.325
     \]  

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) ~0.39**: \( 0.39^2 = 0.15 \), which corresponds to a 15% amplitude—too large.  
- **B) ~0.07**: \( 0.07^2 = 0.0049 \), which corresponds to a 0.49% amplitude—too small.  
- **C) ~0.11**: \( 0.11^2 = 0.0121 \), which corresponds to a 1.21% amplitude—too small.  
- **D) ~0.32**: \( 0.32^2 = 0.1024 \), which corresponds to a 10.24% amplitude—close to the calculated 10.6% amplitude.  

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star is approximately **0.32** times the radius of the host star.
