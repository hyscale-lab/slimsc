Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian.

Alright, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, the combined mass of the fermions must be less than the mass of the boson. Because, you know, energy and mass are related, and the boson's mass has to be enough to create the pair.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh right, usually, the interaction term for a boson coupling to fermions is something like L = g ψ̄ ψ X, where X is the boson field. So here, it's -λ times a sum over fermion species f, of ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, but I think the exact form might not matter for figuring out the decay modes; what matters is which fermions the boson X can interact with.

So X can couple to any fermion f. The possible decays would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion species. But wait, which fermions are there, and what are their masses?

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Let's list the known fermion masses to see which can be produced.

Fermions come in particles and antiparticles. For charged leptons: electrons (mass ~0.0005 GeV), muons (~0.1 GeV), taus (~1.777 GeV each). For neutrinos, their masses are super tiny, but I don't think they're considered here because the problem probably assumes charged leptons and quarks.

For quarks, the masses are up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. Their masses are approximately: up and down are like a few MeV each (0.003-0.005 GeV), strange is about 95-110 MeV (0.095-0.11 GeV), charm is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.1-4.7 GeV, and top is way heavier, around 173 GeV.

So for each possible fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let me go through each possible fermion pair:

1. Electron pair: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV. Definitely allowed. So X → e+ e- is possible.

2. Muon pair: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 GeV. Also allowed. X → μ+ μ- is possible.

3. Tau pair: 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV. Less than 6 GeV, so yes. So X → τ+ τ- is allowed.

Neutrinos: their masses are negligible, but if the problem includes them, but probably not, since the options don't include them. Plus, the Lagrangian seems to be written for charged leptons.

Quark pairs:

- Up: 2 * 0.003 = 0.006 GeV. Allowed. X → u ū.

- Down: similar to up, about 0.01 GeV, so allowed. X → d d̄.

- Strange: 2 * 0.1 GeV, 0.2 GeV. Allowed. X → s s̄.

- Charm: 2 * 1.5 GeV = 3 GeV. Less than 6 GeV. So X → c c̄.

- Bottom: 2 * 4.5 GeV = 9 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because the combined mass is 9 GeV, which is higher than 6 GeV. So that's not allowed.

- Top: way too heavy, way over 6 GeV. So no t t̄ decay.

So the allowed fermion pairs are: e+, e-; μ+, μ-; τ+ τ-; u, ū; d, d̄; s, s̄; c, c̄.

Wait, but what about whether the boson X can actually couple to these fermions? The Lagrangian term must include couplings to each fermion. The given interaction is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f(y). So for each fermion f, the coupling exists. So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs.

So looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b̄, s s̄, etc. But wait, the mass for bottom is too high. So option A is wrong.

Option B: X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-. This includes c, which is allowed (3 GeV <6 GeV). But what about the bottom? No, since B doesn't include b. So B would include c, but not b, which is correct because X can't decay into b.

Option C: Includes c, s, u, d, t. But top is way too heavy, so that's impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option D: Includes b, which is not allowed. So D is wrong.

Wait, wait, let me check. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Charm quark mass: let's say around 1.5 GeV each. So 3 GeV total. So that's okay.

Bottom quark: about 4.5 GeV each. Sum is 9 GeV, which is more than 6. So X can't decay into b b̄.

So the allowed quark decays are u, d, s, c.

So the decay options should include X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-. So that's all the allowed ones except for b. So option B is correct.

Wait, but looking again, the options:

Option B: c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, that's correct.

Option D includes b, which is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction Lagrangian provided. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the combined mass of the fermions must be less than the boson's mass. The interaction Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) can couple to any fermion \( f \), so the possible decay modes depend on the fermion masses.

### Fermion Masses and Decay Analysis:
1. **Charged Leptons**:
   - \( e^+ e^- \): \( 2 \times 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} = 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \): \( 2 \times 0.1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \): \( 2 \times 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

2. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \bar{u} \): \( 2 \times 0.003 \, \text{GeV} = 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( d \bar{d} \): \( 2 \times 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( s \bar{s} \): \( 2 \times 0.1 \, \text{GeV} = 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( c \bar{c} \): \( 2 \times 1.5 \, \text{GeV} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( b \bar{b} \): \( 2 \times 4.5 \, \text{GeV} = 9 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, exceeds 6 GeV).
   - \( t \bar{t} \): \( 2 \times 173 \, \text{GeV} = 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, far exceeds 6 GeV).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed due to the mass constraint. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed due to the mass constraint. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed due to the mass constraint. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), making **Option B** the correct choice.
