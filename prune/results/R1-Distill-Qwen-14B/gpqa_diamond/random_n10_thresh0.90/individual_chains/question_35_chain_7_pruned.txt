Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it out.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which of the given statements is correct.

First, I remember that the intrinsic angular momentum for a spin-½ particle (like a muon) has components Sx, Sy, Sz, each of which is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of these components are ±ħ/2, but wait, in this case, c is h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2πħ. So, h/(4π) would be (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.

h is Planck's constant, which is equal to 2πħ. So c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

So the operator Ay is (ħ/2) times the given matrix S. Let me write out matrix S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So, S is a 2x2 matrix. Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, Ay is c·S, so substituting, Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Alternatively, since S is a Pauli matrix, I can recall some properties. The Pauli matrices (like Sx, Sy, Sz) have eigenvalues ±ħ/2. Wait, but wait—S here is the same as Sy for a spin-½ particle, right? Because the structure of S matches that of Sy.

Wait, the standard Pauli matrices are usually represented as σx, σy, σz, each with 2x2 entries. But in this case, S is given. So perhaps S is (ħ/2)σy, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question says S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second (i, 0). Let me compare that to the Pauli matrices.

The standard σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is exactly σy. So if S = σy, and Ay = (ħ/2)σy.

So the eigenvalues of σy are ±1. So when multiplied by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become ±(ħ/2).

Wait, but let me think again. The eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So for Ay, which is (ħ/2) multiplied by S (which is σy), the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1, then Ay has eigenvalues ±(ħ/2).

But wait, the actual eigenvalues for σy are indeed ±1, so for Ay, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) * 1 and (ħ/2) * (-1), so ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ±ħ/2. But wait, ħ is h/(2π), because h = 2πħ. Wait, no— h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So ħ = h/(2π). So ħ/2 = h/(4π). Oh wait, so (ħ/2) is h/(4π). Wait, so the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) * [±1], which is ±h/(4π).

Wait, no, because S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±1, so when you multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues become c * 1 and c * (-1), which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, that's right.

So the eigenvalues a are ±h/(4π). Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary part of eigenvalue are ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Hmm, no— eigenvalues for Ay are real, right? Because the operator Ay is Hermitian. Because S is Hermitian, since σy is Hermitian, and c is real, so Ay is Hermitian. Thus, the eigenvalues are real. So any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is wrong.

Looking at option A: It says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That's not possible because eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, but eigenvalues are real, so this option is talking about complex eigenvalues which isn't the case. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Well, I know that for angular momentum operators, the square of the total angular momentum (like S²) commutes with each component (Sx, Sy, Sz). So if a function is an eigenfunction of Sy, it is also an eigenfunction of S². So for the operator Ay (which is Sy scaled by a constant), the eigenfunctions would be eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is (c S)^2 = c² S², and S² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, which commutes with any operator. So eigenfunctions of Ay would also be eigenfunctions of A². So C says that it can be eigenfunction of A² but not Az. I'm not sure. But wait, the question is about the correct statement.

Wait, but the statement in C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Let me think. Since A² is (c S)^2 = c² S². For a spin-½ particle, S² is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) I, because S² has eigenvalues ( (ħ/2)^2 ) for any direction.
