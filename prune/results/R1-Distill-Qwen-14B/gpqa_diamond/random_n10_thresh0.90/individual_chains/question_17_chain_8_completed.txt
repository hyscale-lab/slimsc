Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem about calcium ions in a solution. So, the question says that we have a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the concentration is 0.02 M. I think the formula for the formation constant involves the concentration of the metal ion and the EDTA.

Wait, the formation constant K is usually given by K = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). So if I rearrange that, [Ca] would be [Ca-EDTA]/(K * [EDTA]). But I'm not sure about the exact relation here.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation of the complex. The complex [CaEDTA]^2- dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- (I think EDTA has a charge of 4- when it's deprotonated enough to form the complex, but maybe the exact charge isn't crucial here). 

So the formation constant is K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. So [Ca^2+] = (K * [CaEDTA^2-]) / [EDTA^4-]. But wait, in a 0.02 M solution of CaEDTA^2-, the initial concentration is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, some of the complex breaks down into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the concentration is 0.02 M, and the solution is ideal pH, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available. So the [EDTA^4-] should be equal to the [Ca^2+] from the dissociation, right? Because for every mole of CaEDTA^2- that dissociates, it produces one mole each of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So let me set up an equation. Let x be the concentration of Ca^2+ ions that dissociate. Then, [Ca^2+] = x, [EDTA^4-] = x, and [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. But wait, since K is a large number (5e10), which suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation would be very little. That means x is going to be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the K equation:

K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = x * x / (0.02) 

So K = x^2 / 0.02 

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = x² / 0.02 

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = 5e10 * 0.02 

0.02 is 2e-2, so 5e10 * 2e-2 = 1e9. So x² = 1e9. 

Then x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4. Wait, that can't be right because 3e4 M is way higher than the initial concentration. That can't be possible because the maximum possible [Ca^2+] would be 0.02 M if all the complex dissociated, which it won't because K is large.

Wait, did I make a mistake here. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, maybe I have the formation constant expression wrong. The formation constant K is given by:

K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-])

So if I rearrange that, [Ca^2+] = [CaEDTA^2-]/(K [EDTA^4-])

But in the solution, the total EDTA comes from the dissociation of CaEDTA^2- and any free EDTA. Wait, but wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, and I assume that the EDTA is in excess? Or perhaps the solution is such that the only EDTA present is from the complex?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the only source of Ca and EDTA in solution? Or is there free EDTA in solution as well?

Wait, if the solution contains the complex, and nothing else, then the only EDTA is from the dissociation of the complex. So previously, I assumed that the [EDTA^4-] = x, but that's wrong because the complex is 0.02 M, and if some dissociates, the [CaEDTA^2-] becomes 0.02 -x, and [Ca^2+] and [EDTA^4-] are both x.

Wait, but if the complex is 0.02 M, and it's the only source, then the total EDTA is x (from dissociation). So the formation constant expression is correct as before.

But then when I solved, I got x squared equal to 1e9, which gives x about 3e4 M, which is impossible because the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I inverted K. Let me double-check the formation constant definition. Formation constant Kf is [complex]/([metal][ligand]). So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

So [Ca^2+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / (Kf [EDTA^4-])

Wait, but [EDTA^4-] is equal to [Ca^2+] because each complex dissociation gives one Ca^2+ and one EDTA^4-. So [EDTA^4-] = [Ca^2+] = x.

So substituting, [Ca^2+] = (0.02 - x) / (Kf * x)

But since Kf is very large (5e10), and the denominator (Kf x) is big, the numerator (0.02-x) must be approximately 0.02. So:

[Ca^2+] = 0.02 / (5e10 * x )

But wait, [Ca^2+] is x, so:

x = 0.02/(5e10 * x )

Multiply both sides by 5e10 x:

x^2 = 0.02/(5e10 )

x^2 = (2e-2) / (5e10 ) = 4e-13

x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2e-6.5 = approximately 6.3e-7 M. Oh, because 10^(-6.5) is about 3.16e-7, wait no, wait:

Wait, sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. The square root of that is sqrt(4) * 10^(-13/2) )= 2 * 10^-6.5. What is 10^-6.5? It's 1e-6 * 10^-0.5 ≈ 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me recheck the math. So Kf is 5e10.

We have [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let [Ca^2+] = x. Then [EDTA^4-] = x.

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/(x^2 ) = 5e10.

So x^2 = [CaEDTA^2-]/(5e10 ) = 0.02 / (5e10 ) = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 6.32e-7 M. So that's option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Here, \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\). Since the pH is ideal, we assume that all EDTA is in the form \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), and the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\). Let \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\), then \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\), and \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\) (since dissociation is negligible due to the large \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\)).

Substituting into the formation constant equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
