Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on their parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I think I need to connect those concepts.

The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula they're giving is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Right, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth, and it's inversely proportional to the distance. Oh wait, right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), so distance d is 1/plx. So d = 1/plx, meaning plx = 1/d.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to express N in terms of d. Let's write that down. Since N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx = 1/d gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So it's asking for the change in number with respect to r, which I assume is a small range of distance. So perhaps it's the differential, like dN/dr.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. That would mean that for each unit increase in distance, the number of stars increases by a factor proportional to d^5. But wait, wait. Let's think about how N depends on d.

Suppose I have a region of the sky, and I want to find how many stars are in a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. Because stars are spread out in 3D space, the number of stars in such a shell would depend on the volume of the shell.

Wait, the volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in a shell would be proportional to the volume, assuming a uniform distribution. But here, the problem gives a specific relation between N and plx, which is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So maybe the initial approach is correct.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine. The number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx = 1/d, so 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as d increases, N increases as d⁵.

But the question is about how the number of stars change with distance per unit range. So if I have two distances, d and d+dr, what's the change in N? Alternatively, perhaps it's the rate of change, like the derivative dN/dr.

Wait, but N is a cumulative count. Or wait, perhaps the question is not about the cumulative number, but the number per unit distance. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the surface density or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's approach it step by step.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d (in parsecs), N ∝ d^5.

But wait, that would mean that N increases rapidly with distance, which seems counterintuitive. Because as you look further, you might expect the number of nearby stars to decrease. Wait, no, this is about how the number varies in a specific region. Wait, maybe I got the setup wrong.

Wait, the question says, "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So perhaps N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Let me write that as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant.

But plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So substituting gives N = k * (d)^5. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5.

Wait, so as d increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. That would mean that for each unit of distance, the number is going up a lot. But that seems odd because usually, the number of stars within a certain distance decreases with distance, but perhaps in this specific region, it's the opposite. But I'm just following the math.

So if N ∝ d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. Now, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps it's the rate at which N changes with r, which would be the derivative dN/dr.

If N = k * d^5, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the change per unit distance is
