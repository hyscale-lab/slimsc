Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric describes the geometry of a space. So this looks like a two-dimensional metric since it has dx² and dy² terms. The general form is ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy² + cross terms, but here the cross terms are zero because it's (dx² + dy²) multiplied by a factor.

I think this metric might represent some kind of surface in general relativity or differential geometry. Oh, wait, pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. So maybe this is a model of hyperbolic space?

The question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, what does radius mean in this context? I think for a pseudosphere, the radius is related to the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a pseudosphere is negative, and the radius of curvature R is related by K = -1/R². So if the radius is 2, then K would be -1/(2)² = -1/4. But wait, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the radius here is the same as the radius in the metric. Let me think about the metric's denominator. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). If I set that equal to something, maybe the metric looks similar to something I know.

Wait, the metric resembles that of a sphere but with a negative radius squared. Because for a sphere, the metric is usually (dr² + r² dθ²) or something like that, but here it's in terms of x and y. Oh wait, another thought: The metric for a sphere in 3D can be written in terms of x, y, z, but maybe this is a two-dimensional surface.

Alternatively, this could be a two-dimensional surface embedded in three dimensions. Let me think about the line element. The denominator (4 - x² - y²) suggests that as x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up, meaning the surface might have a maximum radius beyond which the metric becomes singular. So this would represent something like the edge of a disk, but in hyperbolic space.

Wait, another approach: perhaps this is a model of hyperbolic space. The standard Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic space has a metric like (4/(R² - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where R is the radius of the disk. But our metric is in terms of x and y, so let's see. The given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So if I let r² = x² + y², then the denominator is 4 - r².

So comparing to the Poincaré disk model, which is usually written with a scale factor. The standard Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). But our denominator is (4 - r²) = 4(1 - (r²)/4). So maybe the scale factor here is different.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the Poincaré disk model is scaled. Let me see. Let me set s = r²/4, so that 4 - r² = 4(1 - s). Then the metric becomes (32)/(4(1 - s)) (dr² + r² dθ²) = (8)/(1 - s) (dr² + r² dθ²). Or wait, perhaps I should compare more carefully.

The standard Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), right? Because the denominator is (1 - r²). So in our case, the denominator is (4 - r²) = 4(1 - (r²)/4). So if I factor out the 4, I can write the denominator as 4 (1 - (r^2)/4). So the metric becomes (32) / [4 (1 - (r^2)/4)] (dr² + r² dθ²) ) = (8) / (1 - (r²)/4) (dr² + r² dθ²). Comparing this to the standard Poincaré metric, which is (4)/(1 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), the only difference is the denominator and the coefficient.

Wait, so if the standard Poincaré model uses a radius R, then the metric is (4/(1 - (r²/R²))) (dr² + r² dθ²). So in our case, R² would be 4, so R=2. So the metric given is for a Poincaré disk model with radius R=2. So this is a model of hyperbolic geometry on a disk of radius 2.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. Wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The area of a pseudosphere usually refers to the entire surface, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the area of a specific region, like the disk in the Poincaré model.

Wait, the Poincaré disk model has an infinite area, because as r approaches R (the edge of the disk), the metric diverges, and the area integral would go to infinity. So if the radius of the pseudosphere is 2, which matches R=2, then the area would be infinite.

Wait, but let me think again. The area in the Poincaré model is computed by integrating the area element over the entire disk. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dr dθ, where g is the determinant of the metric. But since this is a 2D metric, the determinant would be g_{rr} * g_{θθ} - g_{rθ}^2. Since there are no cross terms (g_{rθ}=0), the determinant is g_{rr} * g_{θθ}.

So looking at the metric, dr² and r² dθ² are multiplied by 8/(1 - (r²/4)), so g_{rr} = 8/(1 - r²/4), and g_{θθ} = (8 r²)/(1 - r²/4) ). So the determinant is (8/(1 - r²/4)) * (8 r²/(1 - r²/4)) ) = 64 r²/(1 - r²/4)^2.

Wait, no, wait a second. The metric is ds² = [8/(1 - r²/4)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So the components are g_{rr}=8/(1 - r²/4), g_{θθ}=8 r²/(1 - r²/4). So the determinant g is g_{rr} * g_{θθ} = [8/(1 - r²/4)] * [8 r²/(1 - r²/4)] = 64 r²/(1 - r²/4)^2.

So the area element is sqrt(g) dr dθ. But wait, in 2D, sqrt(g) is the square root of the determinant, but in this case, the metric is diagonal so the determinant is positive, and the square root is sqrt(64 r²/(1 - r²/4)^2) ) = 8 r / (1 - r²/4).

So the area A is the integral over r from 0 to R (which is 2) and θ from 0 to 2π. So A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [8 r / (1 - (r²/4))] dr dθ.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, the denominator (1 - (r²/4)) approaches 1 - (4/4) = 0. So the integrand becomes 8r/(1 - (r²/4)) which approaches infinity as r approaches 2. So the integral from 0 to 2 would be divergent. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but the Poincaré disk model represents an infinite hyperbolic plane in a finite disk. So the area of the entire hyperbolic plane is infinite, which matches what I'm getting here.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up concepts. A pseudosphere is a surface in 3D, but here we're dealing with a 2D hyperbolic plane represented in the Poincaré disk. So the area of the entire 2D hyperbolic plane (modeled here) is infinite.

So looking at the options, option D is +infinity. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure. The pseudosphere is a specific surface, but in this context, the metric given is for a model of hyperbolic space, which has infinite area. So the area is infinite.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric describes a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, resembling the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic space. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) indicates that the surface is embedded within a disk of radius \(R = 2\), as the metric becomes singular when \(x^2 + y^2 = 4\). This is consistent with the Poincaré disk model, where the metric diverges at the boundary of the disk.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\). In the context of the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane is represented within the finite disk, but the area of the hyperbolic plane itself is infinite. This is because the area element in the Poincaré model diverges as \(r\) approaches the boundary of the disk (\(r \to 2\)), leading to an infinite total area when integrating over the entire disk.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (0):** This is incorrect, as the area of the pseudosphere is not zero.
- **Option B (\(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)):** This is not applicable, as the area of the pseudosphere does not depend on \(x^2 + y^2\).
- **Option C (\(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)):** This is also incorrect for the same reason as Option B.
- **Option D (\(+\infty\)):** This is correct, as the area of the entire hyperbolic plane represented by the Poincaré disk model is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is infinite.

Answer: D
