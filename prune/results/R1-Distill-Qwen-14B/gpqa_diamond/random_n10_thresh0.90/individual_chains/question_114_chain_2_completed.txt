Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is taking 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and treating it with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the first reaction looks like a nucleophilic addition. Butanone reacting with cyanide. I remember that ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles. NaCN is providing the cyanide ion as a nucleophile. So, the reaction might be an example of a cyanohydrin formation. Oh right, when you add a nucleophile like CN- to a ketone, it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group.

But wait, what's the reagent A here? In cyanohydrin formation, I think the conditions are usually a base, but sometimes you might acidify. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The reaction of ketones with CN- typically requires an acid catalyst. Because the acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So, the cyanide ion (a strong nucleophile) would attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid). Because that's the typical condition for such additions. So in the first reaction, adding H3O+ would make sense. So options A or B have H3O+ as A.

Now, looking at the second reaction. The starting material is a nitrile group attached to a hydroxybutane chain, and it's converting to a carboxylic acid. So nitriles can be oxidized to carboxylic acids, right? The usual reagents for this are strong oxidizing agents. I remember that KMnO4 under acidic or basic conditions can do that. Or maybe using something like HCl as a catalyst in certain conditions.

Wait, but the reagent B is H2O. Oh, no, wait, no, the reagent B is given as H2O in the reaction. Wait, no, the way the problem is written: the second reaction is with reagent B, and it's written as (H2O). Hmm, perhaps the reagent B is H2O, but that doesn't fit the options. Wait, looking back, the problem says:

2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> product.

Wait, no, I think I misread. The problem says the reaction is in the presence of B and H2O. Or perhaps B is the reagent, and the reaction uses H2O as a solvent or something else. Wait, the way it's written may be confusing, but looking at the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. But what conditions are needed for that?

There are two main methods for nitrile hydrolysis: acidic and basic. Acidic hydrolysis typically uses H2SO4 and heat. Basic conditions might use aqueous NaOH and heat, followed by acid work-up. Alternatively, in some cases, using a catalyst like HgSO4 in acidic conditions can help, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the product, it's a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile has been oxidized. Wait, no, hydrolysis of nitriles can yield carboxylic acids if the conditions are strong enough. Let's think: when a nitrile is treated with excess HCl (H2O and HCl), it can hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, H2O with an acid catalyst, like HCl, could work. Or maybe using H2O under acidic conditions, like with H3O+.

Wait, but in the first reaction, H3O+ was A. So in the second reaction, the reagent is B, and it's H2O and another reagent. Hmm, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis using H2O and a strong acid.

Wait, but looking at the options, for B the choices are HCl, CH3COOH, etc. So if the second reaction uses H2O and HCl as the reagent, that would make sense for hydrolysis.

Wait, so perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH). To do that, you need strong acidic conditions. So HCl and H2O would be the setup, perhaps with heating. So the reagent B would be HCl.

Wait, but then in the options, when looking at option A, B is HCl. Option D has B as CH3COOH. So if the second reaction uses HCl, then option A or C could be possible. Wait, what's the first part's A?

In the first reaction, the reagent A is either H3O+ (options A and B) or NaHSO3 (options C and D). But earlier I thought A is H3O+ for the cyanohydrin formation.

So, for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B). For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (so options A or C).

Looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that fits. So the first reaction uses H3O+ (acid) to get the cyanohydrin, and the second reaction uses HCl (acidic conditions) to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but what about the other options. Let me think again about the second reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the second reaction is a hydrolysis that requires a different condition, like a base.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, which is more likely to form under acidic conditions. Alternatively, using something like dilute H2SO4 and heating, but the options don't have H2SO4. So the available options for B are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (option B and D).

Wait, but looking at the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. When nitriles are hydrolyzed, under acidic conditions like HCl and water, they convert to carboxylic acids. So that would require HCl as a reagent, so B is HCl.

So putting it together, first reaction uses A=H3O+, second reaction uses B=HCl. So the correct option is A.

But wait, let me double-check the first reaction. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would form a cyanohydrin. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yes, that matches the product. And the conditions are acid (H3O+), which makes sense.

So option A is A = H3O+, B = HCl. That's the first reaction and the second reaction.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile in the presence of NaCN and reagent A. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. Acidic conditions are typically required for such reactions to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Therefore, reagent A is likely H₃O⁺ (acid).

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid in the presence of reagent B. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (-CN) is converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Such hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic conditions, and HCl is a suitable reagent for this transformation. Thus, reagent B is likely HCl.

Considering the options:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is not strong enough for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group.
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
