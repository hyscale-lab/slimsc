Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm... Right, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of that happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the star's orbit.

Wait, but how exactly do I calculate the probability? I remember that the probability of a transit (P) is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the sum of the star's radius (R*) and the planet's radius (R_p), multiplied by some factor. Or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's distance? Hmm, I think I might be mixing up some factors.

Wait, no. The transit probability is given by the formula P = (R*/a) / (1 + R*/a)^2 or something like that. Alternatively, I remember that the probability P is approximately (R*/a)^2 multiplied by something else. No, maybe it's more like the area. Oh wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R*)² multiplied by (1 / a²), but wait, no, that's the depth of the transit, not the probability.

Wait, I think I need to get this right. The probability of a planet transiting is given by P = (R* + R_p) / a, but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the size of the star's disk as seen from the planet's position to the planet's orbital path. Oh, right! The formula is P = (2 R*) / (a), but wait, no, that can't be right because the units don't match. Let me get this straight.

I think the transit probability is approximately (R*/a), but that's just a rough estimate. Wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R*, that's approximately R*/a. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R*/a) divided by the sum of (R*/a) and something else. Hmm, maybe it's (R*/a) multiplied by (something else).

Wait, let me think again. The transit probability is actually dependent on the relative size of the star's disk as seen from Earth. So, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius (R*) to the distance from the star to the planet (a), multiplied by some factor. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius over the semi-major axis, but considering the orbital inclination.

Wait, from what I've read before, the probability that a planet transits is given by (R*/a)^2 multiplied by (1 + (M_p)/(M_*))^(something) ), but wait, if the planet and star have circular orbits, maybe that's not a factor. Alternatively, the probability is simply (R_p + R_*) / a, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the formula for transit probability is P = (R* / a) * (1 + (R_p / R*))². Or is it the other way around? Or maybe it's (R_p / (R*))² multiplied by (R* / a) or something else. Maybe I should look for a resource, but since I can't, I'll try to reason it out.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is approximately (R* / a) multiplied by (something). Wait, maybe the actual formula is P ≈ (R* + R_p) / a, but considering that R_p is much smaller than R*, this simplifies to R* / a. But wait, no, that would make it larger if a is smaller, which would mean closer planets have higher transit probabilities, which makes sense.

Wait, but another thought: the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbital plane. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital diameter, so (2 R*) / (2 a) ) = R*/a. But that can't be, because R* is much smaller than a, so the probability would be really low. So maybe it's squared?

Wait, perhaps the formula is (R* / a)^2. But that would
