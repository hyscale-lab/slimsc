Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

First, I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula that comes to mind is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power. 

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, how does mass relate to luminosity? I'm a bit confused here. Oh right, for main-sequence stars, more massive stars are more luminous. But that's when we're considering stars on the main sequence, which I think they are assuming here since they're using black body radiation.

But wait, the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest, and those are the same. Oh! So the peak wavelength emission is the same for both. That must relate to their temperatures because the peak wavelength from a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same (since T = b/λ_max).

Wait, but that seems a bit odd because usually, if Star_1 is more massive, it might be hotter. Oh, but this problem says that when they did spectroscopy, the peak wavelengths are the same. So their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2 = T.

So now, let's think about the luminosity. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same for both, L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) ). But since T1 = T2, the T factor becomes (T^4)/(T^4) = 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that's a factor of 2.25, which would be option A. But wait, the question says that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor. So possibly, 2.25 is the factor. But let me check.

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0 km/s and Star_2's is 700 km/s. Oh, wait, how does radial velocity affect this? Hmm. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (their peak emission) are the same. So that must mean that after considering the Doppler shift, their observed peak wavelengths are the same.

Wait, but if the stars are moving, their observed wavelengths would
