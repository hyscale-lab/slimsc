Okay, so I have this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, F = -kx. But this is a relativistic version, which complicates things a bit.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. So, in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, and at maximum displacement (amplitude A), the kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)kA². Then, when the mass passes through equilibrium, all potential is converted to kinetic, so (1/2)mv² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which would be option C. But wait, this is a relativistic scenario, so things are different.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy includes relativistic effects. The relativistic energy equation is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Also, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy: KE = (γ - 1)mc².

So, the system's energy in the relativistic case would be the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. The potential energy for a spring is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy must use the relativistic expression.

Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², and the total energy would be (1/2)kA² in the classical case. But in relativity, the energy at maximum displacement is the potential energy plus the rest mass energy, but wait, when x is maximum (A), the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, but the potential is (1/2)kA². So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or does the rest mass energy already include mc²?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The rest energy is mc². The oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential. At that point, the mass is at rest, so its total energy is the sum of rest energy and potential energy. Wait, but that can't be right because the potential is part of the system's energy. Or perhaps the potential energy is considered separate from the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy in this relativistic case is the sum of the rest mass energy, the kinetic energy, and the potential energy. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe the potential energy is treated as part of the total energy, and the mass's total energy is the sum of rest energy and its kinetic energy.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the energy conservation. At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So all the energy is potential plus rest mass? Or maybe the potential energy is considered part of the mechanical energy, separate from the rest mass. Wait, no, in non-relativistic mechanics, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², and that's equal to the kinetic energy when velocity is maximum. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is different.

Wait, perhaps the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is equal to the rest mass energy plus the total mechanical energy in the classical case? That seems like a stretch. Maybe I should model the situation.

At x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA² + mc² (if E includes rest mass). But wait, mc² is the rest energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Then, when the oscillator is at x = 0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy at that point is the sum of the kinetic energy (relativistic) and the rest energy.

Wait, but no, because the potential is zero at x=0. So the total energy is the kinetic energy plus the rest energy.

So, at x = A: E = potential + rest energy = (1/2)kA² + mc².

At x = 0: E = kinetic energy (relativistic) + rest energy.

So, setting them equal:

(1/2)kA² + mc² = KE + mc².

Wait, that can't be right because then KE would be (1/2)kA², but that's the non-relativistic case. But in reality, KE in relativity is different.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the rest energy is separate. So the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential).

In that case, E = mc² + (kinetic + potential). So, at x = A, the kinetic is zero, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0, the potential is zero, so E = mc² + KE.

So, equate the two expressions:

mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + KE.

Which implies KE = (1/2)kA². But that's the same as the non-relativistic case, which doesn't make sense because KE in relativity shouldn't be the same. Uh-oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is part of the total energy, and the system's total energy is (1/2)kA² in the non-relativistic case, but in the relativistic case, it's more complicated because the mass increases with velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the system's potential energy is (1/2)kx². So the total mechanical energy is E = KE + potential. But then, in the non-relativistic case, E is (1/2)m v_max² + (1/2)kA² = (1/2)kA² + (1/2)kA² = kA²/2. Wait, no, in non-relativistic, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA².

But in relativity, the total energy when the mass is at x=0 is KE + rest mass energy. So, E = (γ - 1)mc² + mc² = γ mc².

Wait, perhaps the total mechanical energy E is equal to the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). So, at x=A, E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At x=0, E = mc² + KE, so KE = (1/2)kA².

But that again brings us back to the non-relativistic case, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the equation of motion for a relativistic oscillator is different. The restoring force is F = -kx, but in relativity, the equation isn't as straightforward. Let me think about the equation of motion.

In special relativity, the momentum is γmv, and F = d(momentum)/dt = d(γmv)/dt. But for a harmonic oscillator, F = -kx. So,

d(γmv)/dt = -kx.

But this is a differential equation that's more complicated than the non-relativistic case. Solving this might give a different expression for velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps energy conservation can be applied more directly. The potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. The total energy is E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is it (1/2)kA² plus rest energy?

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is E = mc² + (kinetic + potential). So at maximum x = A, KE is zero, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At x = 0, the potential is zero, so E = mc² + KE. So,

mc² + (1/2)kA² = mc² + KE.

Which implies KE = (1/2)kA². But that's the same as non-relativistic. So that can't be right because in reality, KE in relativity isn't (1/2)mv². So perhaps this approach isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the equation for the oscillator needs to take into account relativistic effects. Let's think of the oscillator's equation as relativistic.

The force is F = -k x. So, F = d(momentum)/dt = d(γ m v)/dt. And since F = -k x, we have:

d(γ m v)/dt = -k x.

This is a second-order differential equation because x is a function of time, and velocity is dx/dt. It's a bit complicated, but perhaps we can use energy methods instead.

The total energy in the system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. The potential is (1/2)k x². The kinetic energy in relativity is (γ - 1) m c².

So, E = (γ - 1) m c² + (1/2)k x².

At maximum displacement x = A, the velocity is zero, so γ = 1. So E = (1-1) m c² + (1/2)k A² = (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point, x = 0, the velocity is maximum. So the kinetic energy is (γ - 1) m c², and the potential is zero.

So, E = (γ - 1) m c². 

Setting E equal at both points:

(1/2)k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

So, (1/2)k A² + m c² = γ m c².

So, γ = ( (1/2)k A² + m c² ) / ( m c² ) = [ (k A²)/(2m) ) + c² ] / c².

Wait, let me compute that again.

From E, (1/2)k A² = (γ -1 ) m c².

So,

γ = [ (1/2)k A² / (m c²) ) ] + 1.

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, α.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

We can solve for v.

Let me square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

Then,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

Which simplifies to:

v²/c² = [ (1 + α)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + α)^2.

Expanding the numerator:

(1 + 2α + α² - 1 ) = 2α + α².

So,

v²/c² = (2α + α²) / (1 + α)^2.

Factor numerator: α(2 + α) / (1 + α)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write this as:

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 ]

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 )

Now, substituting α back:

α = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Let me compute 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

So,

1/(1 + α)^2 = [2 m c²]^2 / (2 m c² + k A² )^2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the expression as:

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Yes, that looks like it matches.

Alternatively, let's see if any of the options match this expression.

Our expression is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ] )

Which is the same as option D.

Wait, let me confirm.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²/(2 m c²) ) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we got.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the system includes both the relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy due to the spring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so the total energy is purely potential:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2
   \]  
   Here, \( mc^2 \) is the rest energy of the mass, and \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) is the potential energy.

   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), the velocity is maximum, and the total energy is purely relativistic kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

   Equating the total energy at both points:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 + mc^2 = \gamma mc^2
   \]

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging the equation:  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Inverting and solving for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
