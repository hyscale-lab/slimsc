Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied. So, if P is the operator, and v is the eigenvector, then P v = λ v, where λ is the eigenvalue.

The question gives me the components of the operator P along x, y, and z. Let me write them down. Oh right, the operator components are given as matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix with first row [0,1] and second row [1,0]. That matrix looks like it swaps the basis vectors. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row [0, -i] and second row [i, 0]. And P_z is (ħ/2) times a diagonal matrix [1, 0; 0, -1], right?

Wait, the question is about the eigenvector for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, so the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its y-component is zero. So, n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in x-z plane, θ is the angle from the z-axis, I think.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P with eigenvalue ħ/2. But wait, usually, when we talk about angular momentum operators, the operator for an arbitrary direction is a combination of the basis components. So, the operator P here is probably the component along the direction n. That makes sense because the operator for a direction would be a dot product of the vector operator with the direction vector.

Oh, right! The operator P for direction n would be P·n, where n is a unit vector. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is a unit vector. So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So, the operator P would be (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Hmm. So, let me write that out. So, first, compute each P component as a matrix
