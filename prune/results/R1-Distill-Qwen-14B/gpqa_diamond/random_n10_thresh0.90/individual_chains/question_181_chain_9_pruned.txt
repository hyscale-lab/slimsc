Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in different energy bands. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stopped 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, pp-III... I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I, II, III are different steps or branches in that chain. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces neutrons, which then go on to form deuterium and contribute to the fusion process.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, right? Because in the reaction where a proton captures a neutron (or vice versa), a positron and a neutrino are emitted. Wait, more specifically, when a proton and a neutron combine to form deuterium, they emit a positron and a neutrino. That's the pp-I reaction. Or wait, maybe the pp-III is a different step. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the pp chain has a few steps. The initial steps are the most common. So, in the proton-proton chain, the first step is two protons fusing to form a deuterium nucleus, a positron, and a neutrino. That's the pp-I branch. Then, if another proton captures onto the deuterium, you get tritium, which can decay into helium-3, which then fuses with another helium-3 to make helium-4. Alternatively, two helium-3 can make helium-4. But wait, there's another branch where a deuterium captures a proton to form tritium and emits a positron and neutrino. That's the pp-II branch. Or is that the same as pp-I?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The standard pp chain starts with two protons (p + p) → ²H (deuterium) + e⁺ + ν_e. That's the first step. The deuterium can then capture another proton to form tritium: ²H + p → ³H + e⁺ + ν_e. Then, the tritium can either decay or fuse further. If it decays, it goes to ³He, which then fuses with another ³He to form ⁴He, releasing energy. Alternatively, two ²H can fuse in a different way.

Wait, but the pp-III branch is a specific part. Oh right, in the pp-III branch, a proton and a neutron (but wait, where do neutrons come from? Because the Sun is mostly protons. Oh, right, in the initial steps, the proton captures a neutron? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, when a deuterium nucleus captures a neutron, but wait, the Sun's core is mainly protons and helium, not neutrons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch refers to when a proton captures a neutron, which is part of a reaction chain. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The pp chain's main branches are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The pp-I is the first step, producing deuterium, positron, and neutrino. The pp-II is when a deuterium captures a proton to form tritium, emitting another positron and neutrino. The pp-III is when a deuterium nucleus captures a neutron, turning into a tritium nucleus, which then decays. Wait, but how do you get neutrons in the Sun? Because the Sun is mostly protons, so maybe the production of neutrons is via other reactions, like from the decay of heavier nuclei like ³He or ⁷Be or something?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's get back to the problem. The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. So when the pp-III branch stops, the flux in certain energy bands would change.

The problem states that all other reactions remain as they were. So, the only change is the stopping of pp-III. So, what neutrinos does the pp-III branch produce?

In the pp-I and pp-II steps, each produces a neutrino. The pp-I step emits a neutrino with lower energy, I think. Because the positron emitted has lower energy,
