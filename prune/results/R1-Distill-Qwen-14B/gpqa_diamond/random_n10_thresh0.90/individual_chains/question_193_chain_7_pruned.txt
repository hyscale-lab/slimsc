Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, right? So the formula they're giving is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, so plx = 1/r, where r is the distance.

Wait, so if plx is 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. So the number of stars N is proportional to (1/plx)^5. Substituting plx in terms of r, that's (r)^5. So N ∝ r^5?

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So they're asking about the number of stars in a shell of radius r, which is a thin slice or a small range in distance. In other words, they're asking for the differential number of stars, dN, per unit distance dr.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr would be the derivative of N with respect to r. Let me compute that. The derivative of r^5 is 5r^4. So dN/dr ∝ r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would go like r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is ~r^4. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/r. So when they say N varies as 1/(plx^5), substituting gives N = k*(plx)^-5 = k*(r)^5. Oh right, because plx is 1/r, so (plx)^-5 is r^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So maybe they're talking about the differential, the rate of change. So when you have a thin shell at radius r, the number of stars in that shell would be 4πr² dr multiplied by some density. Oh wait, wait a second. Oh, maybe I'm confusing this with volume considerations.

Wait, no. If the number of stars is proportional to r^5, then the number in a shell of
