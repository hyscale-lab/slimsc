Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So this ρ is a 2x2 matrix because it's dealing with a qubit.

I think I should write out what ρ looks like in matrix form. The |0><0| is a matrix with a 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has a 1 in (2,2) and zeros elsewhere. So when I add them, each has a 1 in their respective diagonal positions, and the rest are zero. Then, I multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal becomes 1/2.

So ρ matrix would be:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Wait, that looks like a diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries equal to 1/2. I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere uses a vector r with components (x,y,z) such that the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's write that formula down. The general form is ρ = (I + xσx + yσy + zσz)/2. Wait, no, it's actually (I + r · σ)/2 where r is a vector (x,y,z) and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices (σx, σy, σz).

So let's expand that. The identity matrix I is:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, 1] ]

Each Pauli matrix:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when we compute (I + r · σ)/2, let's compute it step by step. Let's say r = (x, y, z). Then r · σ would be xσx + yσy + zσz.

So, I'll compute each term:

xσx = x * [[0,1],[1,0]]
yσy = y * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
zσz = z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these together:
[[ z, x - iy ],
 [ x + iy, -z ]]

Then, adding the identity matrix I:
I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so when you add I, you get:
[[1+z, x - iy],
 [x + iy, 1 - z]]

Wait, no. Wait, the expression is (I + r·σ)/2. So each of the terms I, xσx, etc., are added together, then multiplied by 1/2.

Wait, no, I think the correct expansion is:

(I + r·σ)/2 = (1/2) * [ I + xσx + yσy + zσz ]

So let's compute each part:

I/2 is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]
xσx/2 is [[0, x/2], [x/2, 0]]
yσy/2 is [[0, -i y/2], [i y/2, 0]]
zσz/2 is [[z/2, 0], [0, -z/2]]

Now sum all these matrices:

The (1,1) element: 1/2 + z/2
The (1,2) element: x/2 + (-i y/2)
The (2,1) element: x/2 + i y/2
The (2,2) element: 1/2 - z/2

So putting it all together, the ρ matrix is:

[ [ (1 + z)/2 , (x - iy)/2 ],
  [ (x + iy)/2 , (1 - z)/2 ] ]

Now, looking back at the given ρ matrix:

ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Comparing the two, let's set the matrices equal.

So, (1 + z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + z = 1 → z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - z)/2 = 1/2 → same as above, z=0.

The off-diagonal terms are (x - iy)/2 = 0. So for both x and y to satisfy this, we can write:

x - iy = 0 → x = 0 and y = 0 (since x and y are real numbers, right? Because r is a real vector). Because if x is real and y is real, then x must be zero and y must be zero for x - iy to be zero.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The off-diagonal terms (x - iy)/2 and (x + iy)/2 must be zero. So for these to be zero, (x - iy) must be zero. Since both x and y are real, the only solution is x=0 and y=0.

So our r vector is (0,0,z), but earlier we found z=0. So r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait! Let me make sure. Because in the density matrix, the off-diagonal terms are zero. So in our case, the off-diagonal terms are (x - iy)/2 and (x + iy)/2, which must both be zero. So indeed, x=0 and y=0.

So the vector r is (0,0,0), which would be the origin in the Bloch sphere representation.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that should be the answer.

Another way to think: when the density matrix is diagonal with equal probabilities for |0> and |1>, it's the completely mixed state. So on the Bloch sphere, the mixed state for a qubit is represented by the origin, because it's maximally mixed, no coherence, and no preferred axis. So yeah, r is zero.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. The Bloch sphere representation of a qubit maps the density matrix to a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\) such that:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
1 + z & x - iy \\
x + iy & 1 - z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we observe:

1. The diagonal terms \((1 + z)/2 = 1/2\) and \((1 - z)/2 = 1/2\), which imply \(z = 0\).
2. The off-diagonal terms \((x - iy)/2 = 0\) and \((x + iy)/2 = 0\), which imply \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\).

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the maximally mixed state, which has no coherence or preference for any axis.

From the options provided:

- **A)** \((1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \((0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as \(z = 0\), not \(z = 1\).
- **C)** \((0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as derived above.
- **D)** \((1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this does not match the density matrix.

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Answer: C
