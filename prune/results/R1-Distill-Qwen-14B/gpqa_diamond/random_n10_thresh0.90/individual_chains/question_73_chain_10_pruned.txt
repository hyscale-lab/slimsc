Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says two astronauts are moving at relativistic speeds. Their masses are 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics because of relativistic effects. So, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the formula to find the relative velocity u' when two objects are moving at u and v relative to each other, or wait, no, maybe I have it confused. Let me think. If object A is moving at velocity u relative to an observer, and object B is moving at velocity v relative to the same observer, then the velocity of B as seen from A is given by (v - u)/(1 - uv/c²). Or is it (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²)? Hmm, maybe I should get the exact formula right.

Wait, no, think about it. If frame S sees object A moving at u and object B moving at v, then in frame A, the velocity of B would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Because from A's perspective, B is moving at a speed that depends on how they're moving relative to each other.

So in this problem, astronaut 1 has mass 2m moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 has mass 3m moving at 0.5c. We want the relative speed of astronaut 2 as seen from astronaut 1's frame. So u would be 0.6c (since that's astronaut 1's speed in the lab frame, but wait, no, in the lab frame, both are moving. Wait, no, the question is about the relative speed between them. Oh, perhaps I should clarify: the relative speed is how fast one is moving with respect to the other. So if astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from astronaut 1's perspective, astronaut 2 is moving at (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I have the formula correct. The formula for the relative velocity when changing frames is (v - u) / (1 - (v u)/c²) if you're going from the lab frame to the frame of the first object. So in this case, from the first astronaut's perspective, the second astronaut's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So that's negative, which makes sense because astronaut 2 is moving slower than astronaut 1 in the same direction. The denominator is 1 - (0.5*0
