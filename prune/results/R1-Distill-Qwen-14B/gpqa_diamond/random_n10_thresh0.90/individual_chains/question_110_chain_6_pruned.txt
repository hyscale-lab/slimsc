Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think through the information step by step.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) with different characteristics, and I need to determine which ones can be observed by both instruments. The key here is the apparent V magnitude each star has because the spectrographs have different brightness limits.

First, I should recall the brightness limits for each spectrograph. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning it can detect stars up to 17 mag. HIRES, on the other hand, can handle stars brighter than 16 mag. So any star that's brighter (has a lower apparent magnitude) than the cutoff can be detected.

Wait, no. Wait, that's the other way around. Because lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than (i.e., lower than) 17 mag for ESPRESSO, then it's observable. Same with HIRES: stars brighter than 16 mag are observed, so their apparent magnitude should be less than or equal to 16.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. It says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. So brighter means lower magnitude, so V < 17. Similarly, for HIRES, V <16.

So a star can be detected by both if its apparent magnitude is less than 17 (can be seen by ESPRESSO) AND less than 16 (can be seen by HIRES). Wait, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, meaning V <17, it's visible by ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, it needs V <16. So the star must be brighter than both 16 and 17? That can't be because 16 is brighter than 17. Wait, no, because 16 is a brighter magnitude than 17. So if a star is brighter than 16 mag, it's automatically brighter than 17 mag as well. So for a star to be observable by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude <16, because that's the stricter condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the stars could have apparent magnitudes between 16 and 17 and only be detectable by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So the possible stars that can be detected by both would have V <16, while stars with V between 16 and 17 can be detected only by ESPRESSO.

Wait, but the question is which can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <17 (for ESPRESSO) and <16 (for HIRES). So the star must be brighter than 16 mag, because if it's brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17. So the star's apparent magnitude must be <=15.99 or something, which for practical purposes, we can consider it as less than 16.

Wait, but looking at the options, maybe it's better to compute each star's apparent magnitude and see which ones are below 16 for both.

Wait, but wait. The stars are given either their absolute magnitude and distance, or in some cases their apparent magnitude. So I'll need to compute the apparent magnitude for the stars that don't have it provided.

Let me list each star and figure out their apparent V magnitude.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude (Mv) is 15.5 mag, distance is 10 pc. So I can compute apparent magnitude using the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10) where d is in parsecs.

So m = 15.5 + 5
