Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is that distance is inversely proportional to parallax. So if plx is small, the distance is really big.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars is the same in a given volume, right? So if the galaxy is filled with stars uniformly, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Parallax plx is in arcseconds, I think. So I need to relate the number of stars in a certain range of plx to the parallax itself.

Let me think about the geometry. Parallax plx is given by plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So plx is in inverse parsecs. The parallax range would be from plx to plx + dplx, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Wait, no, the question is about the number per unit plx. So the unit is 1/parsec, because plx is in arcseconds, but wait wait, no. Wait, parallax is measured in arcseconds, but the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1/d (d in parsecs). So plx has units of 1/parsecs.

Wait, but the number of stars per unit parallax range. So if I have a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx, what is the corresponding distance? Well, since d = 1/plx, the distance range would be from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx). Hmm, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of distance.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to the surface area of the shell (4πr²) times the thickness dr. So N(r, dr) = n * 4π r² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume). Since n is constant, the number per unit dr is proportional to r².

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d = 1/r, so r = 1/plx. So substituting, N(proportional to) r² dr. But I need to express this in terms of plx and dplx.

Wait, let's see. I have to change variables from r to plx. Let me set plx = 1/r. So when plx increases a little, from plx to plx + dplx, r goes from r to r - dr, where dr = (r² dplx), because dplx = -dr/(r²) from plx =1/r.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the differential number of stars in terms of plx. So the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4π r² dr. But r is 1/plx, so dr = (dplx)/(plx²). Because if plx = 1/r, then dplx = - dr/(r²) → dr = - r² dplx. Since d
