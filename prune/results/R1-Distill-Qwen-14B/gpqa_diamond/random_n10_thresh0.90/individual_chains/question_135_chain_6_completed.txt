Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? The interaction Lagrangian probably tells me what particles X can decay into.

The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Oh, maybe it's something like the Yukawa interaction? I think the Yukawa coupling is responsible for mediating the interaction between a boson and fermions. So, the boson X here must couple to the fermions ψ_f.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for X to decay into fermions f and f̄, the combined mass of f and f̄ must be less than the mass of X. Because in particle physics, the decay products must have a total rest mass less than the parent particle's mass for the decay to be kinematically allowed. Otherwise, it's impossible because of conservation of energy.

So, I need to find all the fermions where 2m_f < 6 GeV. Let's list the known fermions and their masses. Wait, but which fermions are we talking about here? The problem doesn't specify, but the options include various particles like b, c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and top. 

Let me recall the approximate masses of the quarks and leptons. Quark masses (current, approximate):

- Up (u): about 2-5 MeV
- Down (d): similar to u, maybe 3-6 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, like ~173 GeV

Lepton masses:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.777 GeV

Wait, but for fermions in a decay, each fermion and its antiparticle are produced. So, the mass of each f is m_f, and the pair would have 2m_f.

So, X has mass 6 GeV. So, each decay product pair must have a total mass less than 6 GeV.

Let me go through each possible fermion pair.

A) Options A includes b, s, u, d, tau, e. Let's see:

b quark: m ~4.5 GeV. So 2m is ~9 GeV. Oh wait, that's way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar, since 2*4.5=9 >6. So option A can't be right because it includes b and anti-b. Unless I'm missing something? Wait, maybe the question is about the Yukawa coupling. Oh wait, the Lagrangian must have terms that couple X to ψ_f. So, if X can only couple to certain fermions, those are the only possible decay channels.

Wait, wait, the Lagrangian is given as -λf f̄ ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe it's written as the interaction term.

Alternatively, the interaction term would be something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f. So the coupling is proportional to λ, and the decay would be X → ψ_f ψ_f̄.

So the possible decay products are those fermions ψ_f that X couples to. So the available fermions are those for which this coupling exists. Also, the mass must be less than X's mass.

So, X can decay into any fermion pair as long as their combined mass is less than 6 GeV and the fermion is in the coupling.

But first, let's figure out the possible fermions that X couples to. The problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. Looking at the term, perhaps the interaction is something like X ψ ψ, so X couples to any fermion ψ for which there's a coupling λf.

Wait, the term is written as -λf f̄ ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should think about which fermions ψ_f are involved. But without more context, maybe it's any fermion that the Lagrangian supports. Alternatively, perhaps ψ_f represents all fermions, but that's not likely. Maybe the problem is that the fermions are the ones that the boson X couples to.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more about the kinematic limits, regardless of the coupling. So, regardless of whether the Lagrangian allows it, the X can decay into a fermion pair only if their combined mass is less than X's mass.

But perhaps the problem is also considering the mass of the fermions. So, for each fermion f, if 2m_f < 6 GeV, then X can decay into f and f̄.

So, which fermions satisfy 2m_f < 6 GeV?

Let me list the fermion masses:

Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV → 2m_e ~1 MeV << 6 GeV. So allowed.

Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV → 2m_mu ~211 MeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

Tau (tau): ~1.777 GeV → 2m_tau ~3.554 GeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

Charm (c): ~1.25-1.5 GeV → 2m_c ~2.5-3 GeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

Strangeness (s): ~100 MeV → 2m_s ~200 MeV <6 GeV. Allowed.

Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV → 2m_b ~9 GeV >6 GeV. Not allowed.

Top (t): way too big, 2m_t is way over 6 GeV. So top is out.

Up (u): ~2 MeV, way under.

Down (d): similar to u, around 3-5 MeV.

So the allowed fermions are:

e, mu, tau, c, s, u, d.

So the possible decay channels are:

e+ e−, mu+ mu−, tau+ tau−, c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d dbar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b bbar, s sbar, u ū, d dbar, tau+ tau−, e+ e−. Wait, but b isn't allowed because 2m_b is 9 GeV >6.

So option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ū, d dbar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So all allowed except for c? Wait, 2m_c is about 2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c is allowed.

Wait, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all fermions except b. So that's all allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But t has a mass of ~173 GeV, so 2m_t is way over 6 GeV. So C is incorrect because it includes t.

Option D: X→b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So including b again, which isn't allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, so option B is the one that includes all the allowed fermions. So the answer should be B.

But wait, looking again at option B: it includes 'c cbar', s sbar, u ū, d dbar, tau, mu, e. And each of these has 2m_f <6 GeV. So B is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the fermion masses.

Charm quark: Let's say about 1.5 GeV. 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Tau: ~1.777 GeV, 2m_tau ~3.55 GeV <6 GeV.

So all fermion pairs in option B are allowed, except I don't see any others in the options.

Wait, but the initial Lagrangian given in the problem: does it specify which fermions are involved? Hmm.

The problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. Let me think about the form of the Lagrangian again.

The term is -λf f̄ ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Maybe I misread this. Perhaps it's written as λ X ψ ψ, indicating that X couples to ψ fermions. So, perhaps f in λ is a flavor index. Or maybe ψf is a specific fermion field.

Wait, perhaps the term is written as X ψf ψf, so X couples to all fermions ψf. So in that case, any fermion can be a decay product as long as their mass is less than 3 GeV each (so 2m <6 GeV). So that brings me back to earlier conclusion.

So option B is correct because it includes all fermions with 2m_f <6 GeV except for the b and t quarks.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) is allowed if the total mass of the fermion-antifermion pair, \( 2m_f \), is less than the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

The approximate masses of fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( m_e \sim 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_e \sim 1 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( m_\mu \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \sim 211 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( m_\tau \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( m_c \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \sim 3 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( m_s \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \sim 200 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( m_u \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \sim 4 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( m_d \sim 3 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \sim 6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( m_b \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \sim 9 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( m_t \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermion pairs \( f \bar{f} \) that satisfy \( 2m_f < 6 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- \( e^+ e^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
- \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \)

The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are excluded because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively.

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed fermion pairs for the decay of \( X \).

Answer: B
