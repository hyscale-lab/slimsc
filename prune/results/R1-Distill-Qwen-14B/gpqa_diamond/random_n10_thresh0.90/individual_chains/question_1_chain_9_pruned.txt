Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We want to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The question is asking which energy difference option would allow us to clearly resolve them.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle comes into play when dealing with energy and time. Wait, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time has to be at least on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, which is ħ/2. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2.

But wait, in this context, the energy levels have certain lifetimes. The lifetime is the time for which the state exists before decaying, I think. So the uncertainty in time, Δt, would be related to the lifetime. Typically, I believe Δt is taken as half the lifetime because the state can decay at any time within the lifetime. Or maybe it's the full lifetime? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. But for the sake of the calculation, I'll proceed with the assumption that Δt is the given lifetime, though it's possible that the correct approach uses a different factor, like gamma or something else.

So the energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ divided by (2 * Δt). Because the uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/(2π), but sometimes people use ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt) as a rough estimate, considering the lifetime as the time over which the energy is measured.

Wait, but let me think again. The energy-time uncertainty relation is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if the lifetime is τ, then the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ/(2τ). Because τ is the time uncertainty.

So for each state, we can calculate the uncertainty in their energy, which would give us the minimum detectable energy difference between them.

Wait, but in this question, the two states have different lifetimes. So E1 has τ1 = 1e-9 s, E2 has τ2 = 1e-8 s. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. Or is it the energy difference between the two states?

Wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So perhaps each state has an uncertainty in their energy based on their lifetime. But to resolve them, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or maybe each energy's uncertainty is considered separately, and the difference between the two must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let me think. Suppose the energy of the first state is E1, and the second is E2. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1.

For each state, the uncertainty in energy is ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2τ1) and ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2τ2). But when considering the measurement of the energy difference, the uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ), assuming the uncertainties are independent. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the maximum uncertainty in the difference would be the sum of the two individual uncertainties. Hmm.

But perhaps a better approach is to think about the energy difference being larger than the uncertainty. So to clearly distinguish the two levels, the energy difference (ΔE) should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in E1 and E2. Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in the energy difference is the maximum of the two uncertainties, since one state is being compared to another.

Wait, maybe that's the case. Because if you have two states, each with their own energy uncertainty, the uncertainty in their energy difference would be the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if one uncertainty is much larger than the other, the smaller one doesn't contribute much.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties. Wait, but I think the correct approach is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in the energy difference. So let's model that.

The uncertainty in the energy difference (ΔE) would be the uncertainty in E2 plus the uncertainty in E1, assuming they are independent. So ΔE_total = sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). But perhaps that's being too precise. Alternatively, it could be the sum of the two, but in reality, the exact formula might vary.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the energy difference is E2 - E1. The uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2, and in E1 is ΔE1. So the uncertainty in the difference is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ). Because when you subtract two random variables, the variance is the sum of their variances, assuming they're uncorrelated.

So let me compute that. The Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, perhaps I should convert everything into eV.

First, let's compute the uncertainty in E1: ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1).

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2).

Then, the uncertainty in the difference ΔE is sqrt( (ΔE1)^2 + (ΔE2)^2 ).

We want ΔE > ΔE_difference to distinguish the two states clearly.

Wait, no, wait. To resolve two states, their energies must be separated by more than the combined uncertainty. So the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in the difference. So let me compute the uncertainty in the difference.

So first, compute each ΔE:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2τ1) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) ) = approximately 5.27e-26 J.

Wait, but wait, I'm going to compute this in eV because the options are in eV.

1 eV is approximately 1.60218e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, divide by 1.60218e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV is (5.27e-26 J) / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = ħ/(2τ2) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-8) ) = 5.27e-27 J.

Convert to eV: (5.27e-27 J) / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So the uncertainty in E1 is about 3.29e-7 eV, and in E2 is about 3.29e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainty in the difference is sqrt( (3.29e-7)^2 + (3.29e-8)^2 ) ≈ sqrt( (1.1e-13) + (1.1e-15) ) ≈ sqrt(1.11e-13) ) ≈ 1.05e-6.5 eV? Wait, wait, I need to compute that more accurately.

Wait, 3.29e-7 squared is (3.29e-7)^2 = approximately 1.08e-13. Similarly, (3.29e-8)^2 is about 1.08e-15. Adding them gives 1.09e-13. The square root of that is sqrt(1.09e-13) ≈ approximately 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, because sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7. So with the 1.09 factor, it's about 3.3e-7 eV.

So the uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is approximately 3.3e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference to be clearly resolved, it should be greater than this value, 3.3e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → which is way smaller than 3.3e-7. So this is not sufficient.

B) 1e-11 eV → Even smaller, so no.

C) 1e-4 eV → Which is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than 3.3e-7 eV. So this would be resolvable.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.01e-6 eV, which is smaller than our required 3.3e-7 eV. Because 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, and 3.3e-7 is 3.3e-7. So 0.1e-7 is smaller than 3.3e-7? Wait wait, wait a second. 1e-8 is 0.0001e-6, which is 0.1e-7. So 1e-8 eV is 0.1e-7 eV, which is smaller than 3.3e-7 eV. So that's not sufficient.

Wait, so which options are bigger than 3.3e-7 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV → way bigger. So the correct answer would be option C, because 1e-4 eV is much larger than 3.3e-7 eV.

Wait, but why did I calculate the uncertainty as the sqrt of the sum of the squares? Is that the correct approach? Because energy E1 has uncertainty ΔE1, and E2 has ΔE2. The energy difference is E2 - E1, so the uncertainty in the difference would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but sometimes people use the maximum uncertainty as the larger of the two. For example, if one state has a very small uncertainty and the other is much larger, then the overall uncertainty in the difference would be dominated by the
