Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have a bunch of identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the probability of finding a particle outside x<1 and x>3 is zero.

Hmm. I remember that the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. But wait, in this case, the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3. So the integration limits should be from 1 to 3.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/(sqrt(1+x))) - 0.5i. Wait, is that right? Because the wave functions are usually complex, but here it's given as a function with an imaginary component. Oh, but when you take the absolute square, the imaginary part might not affect the normalization if it's a real function. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wave function here is a complex number, so to find the probability density, we take the modulus squared, which means (psi)(psi*) where psi* is the complex conjugate.

So the given wave function is psi(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate would be [a / sqrt(1+x)] + 0.5i. So when we multiply them, the cross terms (the imaginary parts) will add in a certain way.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is actually a real function, but with an imaginary constant. No, that doesn't make sense because if the wave function is real, its complex conjugate is itself, and the imaginary part would be zero. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is supposed to be a real function. Because in the region where the particle exists (x between 1 and 3), the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That would imply it's a complex function. But that's confusing because usually, stationary states have real wave functions when the potential is symmetric, but maybe this is a more general case.

Wait, but the problem says that when you measure the position, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that means that the wave function is zero outside that region. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that might not be the case. Maybe it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) for the real part, and -0.5i is the imaginary part. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed with what's given.

But wait, if the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, then its complex conjugate is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply them, (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 + [the cross terms would be imaginary parts]. Hmm, no, wait, let me calculate it properly.

The absolute square is |psi|^2 = (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because when you expand (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), you get (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5i)^2* (-1), but wait, wait, no: (x - yi)(x + yi) = x² + y². So yes, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, but that's the probability density. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1, because the total probability is 1.

So the integral becomes:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me split this into two integrals.

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 plus integral [0.25 dx] from1 to3.

Compute each part.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx = a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to3.

So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So total is a² ln(2) + 0.5
