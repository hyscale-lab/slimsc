Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of dx and dy and there's no dz or anything else. So it's describing some kind of surface.

I remember that the area element in a metric like this can be found from the determinant of the metric tensor. The area element dA is sqrt(det(g)) dx dy, where g is the metric tensor. So let me write down the metric tensor components.

The metric tensor g in this case is diagonal because there are no cross terms like dx dy. So g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_{yy} is the same as g_{xx} because the metric is symmetric in x and y. The off-diagonal terms g_{xy} and g_{yx} are zero.

So the determinant of g, det(g), is the product of the diagonal elements since it's diagonal. That would be [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So sqrt(det(g)) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but wait a second. The metric is written as (32/(4-x²-y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the line element is scaled by this factor. So when computing the area, the area element would indeed involve the square root of the determinant, which I calculated as 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Now, the area would be the integral of this area element over the region where the metric is defined. So I need to find the limits of x and y. The denominator in the metric is (4 - x² - y²), which must be non-zero because the metric components can't be infinite (that would cause problems). So 4 - x² - y² > 0, which implies x² + y² < 4. So the region is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. That makes sense because the radius r is given as 2, so the domain is a disk of radius 2.

So the area A is the integral over x and y where x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Hmm, I think polar coordinates would be the way to go here. Because the region is a circle and the integrand is radially symmetric. So let me switch to polar coordinates. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, where r is from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π.

The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ. So putting it together, the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me factor out the constants. The 32 is a constant, as well as the outer integral over θ. So:

A = 32 * ∫ (0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

The integral over θ is straightforward; it's just 2π. So now:

A = 32 * 2π * ∫ (0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

So compute the integral ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r. So (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ] = ∫ [ (-1/2) du / u ].

The limits when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (-1/(2u)) du. Which is the same as ∫ from 4 to 0 of (-1/(2u)) du. Hmm, let's see. Alternatively, I can switch the limits and drop the negative sign.

So ∫ from 0 to 4 of (1/(2u)) du.

Wait, let me think again. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So substituting, the integral is from u=4 to u=0:

∫ (u=4 to 0) [ (-1/(2u )) ] du.

Which is same as (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to 4) (1/u) du.

Wait, because the negative sign flips the limits. So:

∫ from 4 to 0 of (-1/(2u)) du = ∫ from 0 to 4 of (1/(2u)) du.

So integrating (1/(2u)) du gives (1/2) ln|u| + C. Evaluated from 0 to4.

So at u=4, it's (1/2) ln(4). At u=0, it's (1/2) ln(0), which tends to negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to4 is (1/2)(ln4 - (-infty)) which is divergent. So the integral is infinite.

Wait, that's a problem because the area is going to infinity. So the area is infinite? That can't be right. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, the integral ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me recompute without substitution. Let me write it as ∫ [ r dr / (4 - r²) ].

Let me consider the denominator 4 - r². Let me factor it as (2 - r)(2 + r). But perhaps another substitution.

Alternatively, let me compute the indefinite integral:

∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let u = 4 - r². Then du = -2r dr. So rearranged, r dr = -du/2.

So ∫ [ r dr / u ] = ∫ (-du)/(2u) ) = (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So the integral becomes (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

So the definite integral from r=0 to r=2 is:

[ (-1/2) ln(4 - (2)^2) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4 - 0^2) ) ]

Which is [ (-1/2) ln(0) ] - [ (-1/2) ln(4) ) ]

Because ln(0) is negative infinity, so the first term is (-1/2)* (-infty) )= +infty. So the integral ∫0^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr = infinity.

So putting it all together, the area A is 32 * 2π * (infinite) = infinite.

Wait, but that can't be right. So the area is infinitely large? But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. I'm a bit confused about what a pseudosphere is in this context.

Wait, a pseudosphere, or tractricoid, is a surface of constant negative curvature. In Euclidean space, it's a surface that has a finite area, though. Wait, but is that so?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The metric given here is conformally flat, and perhaps it's representing a pseudosphere. But if the area of the surface is infinite, then the answer would be D) +infty.

But wait, let me think again. The metric is given in terms of x and y, and the domain is x² + y² <4. So it's a disk of radius 2. But the area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. Now, as (x,y) approach the boundary (r approaching 2), the denominator approaches zero, causing the area element to blow up. So the total area might indeed be infinite.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the metric represents a compact surface, but in the way it's presented, it's over a non-compact domain? Or maybe I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is actually that of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. But a pseudosphere is a finite area surface of constant negative curvature. Wait, but maybe in this case, the given metric is for an infinite hyperbolic plane, but with a cutoff at r=2, so the area up to r=2 would be finite or infinite?

Wait, no. The given metric is defined on the disk x² + y² <4, so it's a finite region. But because the area element diverges as you approach the boundary, the integral of the area element over the disk becomes infinite. So the area of the pseudosphere (which in this case is the entire surface) would be infinite. So the answer is D) +infty.

But wait, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, maybe I'm thinking of the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area, but a pseudosphere is a finite area surface. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the metric.

Wait another thought: perhaps the metric given is that of a sphere, but scaled in a way that gives a finite area. Alternatively, maybe it's a conformal metric that's a sphere but with a different scaling.

Wait, no. The metric is conformally flat, but the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), with r² = x² + y². So as r approaches 2, the factor becomes 32/(4-4)=infinite. So the geometry is such that as you approach the boundary, the circumference increases, leading to infinite area.

Wait, but the pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, has finite area. So perhaps I'm confusing the metric. Maybe the given metric doesn't correspond to a pseudosphere but to some other surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral indeed diverges, leading to an infinite area. So the correct answer would be option D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we use the area element derived from the metric. The area element in a metric is given by:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det(g)} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g \) is the metric tensor. The metric tensor \( g \) is diagonal with components \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), and the off-diagonal terms \( g_{xy} = g_{yx} = 0 \). Thus, the determinant of \( g \) is:

\[
\det(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2,
\]

and the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is determined by the condition \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to the disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \) in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over this disk. Switching to polar coordinates \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), where \( r \in [0, 2] \) and \( \theta \in [0, 2\pi] \), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants, the integral becomes:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Substituting back \( u = 4 - r^2 \), the integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \left[ -\frac{1}{2} \ln(4 - r^2) \right]_0^2.
\]

At \( r = 2 \), \( \ln(4 - 2^2) = \ln(0) \), which diverges to \(-\infty\). At \( r = 0 \), \( \ln(4 - 0^2) = \ln(4) \). Thus, the integral diverges to \( +\infty \), and the total area becomes infinite.

This divergence occurs because the area element \( \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \) blows up as \( r \to 2 \), leading to an infinite total area. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
