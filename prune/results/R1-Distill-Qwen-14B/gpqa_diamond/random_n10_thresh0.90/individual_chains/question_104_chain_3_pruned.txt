Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and we detect the shift in the spectral lines.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So, planet masses are same, star masses same. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method detects the Doppler shift. Planet 1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet 2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet 2 is compared to Planet 1.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for the RV method is something like the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M planet / M star) * (1 / sqrt(1 + (M planet/M star))) ) multiplied by (sin i), but since the orbits are circular, the inclination i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1. Also, since both stars have the same mass and the planet masses are similar, maybe the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M planet / M star) / sqrt(1 + M planet/M star).

But wait, since M planet is much less than M star (Neptune's mass is much less than Sun's), the denominator sqrt(1 + (M_p/M_s)) approximates to 1. So K is roughly proportional to M_p / M_s. But since in this case, both M_p and M_s are the same for both stars, then K should be the same. But wait, the question says the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstrom, which I think relates to the velocity.

Wait, the Doppler shift is given by delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So the measured shift in wavelength (delta_lambda) is proportional to the velocity (v) of the star. So if the RV semi-amplitude is K, then delta_lambda is proportional to K.

In the RV method, K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So K is given by (V) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) )) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) )

Wait, actually, the formula for K is more accurately given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) / [ (2π * P)^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, I might be getting the formula wrong. Alternatively, I remember that K is given by:

K = ( (2 π G ) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (2 π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( c^(1/3) * (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period P. Let's see, for a circular orbit (e=0), the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, then the ratio of their semi-amplitudes (K1 and K2) should be inversely proportional to the cube root of their orbital periods. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K ∝ P^{-1/3}.

Wait, because from Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4π² G M_star)^{-1} a^3. So a^3 = G M_star P²/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_star P²)^(1/3).

In the RV method, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula as:

K = (v) = [ (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) )^(1/3) ) / c

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 π G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) * (P)^(−1/3) )

Assuming e is zero (circular orbit), and M_p << M_star, so (M_star + M_p) ≈ M_star. Then,

K ≈ ( (27 π G )^(1/3) * M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * ( P )^(-1/3) )

So K ∝ ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * P^(-1/3)

But since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ P^(-1/3).

Given that, the ratio of K1 to K2 is equal to (P2 / P1)^(1/3). Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write this out. Let's say K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet 1, K2 for planet 2.

So K1 ∝ 1/(P1^(1/3)), K2 ∝ 1/(P2^(1/3)).

So K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 ).

But wait, the question says that the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstrom. I think the shift relates to the velocity, so higher shift means higher K. Because the Doppler shift is proportional to velocity. So planet 1 has a K of 5, planet 2 has K of 7. So K2 = (7/5) * K1.

Wait, no, actually, wait. The shift is given as 5 and 7 milliangstrom. But what matters is the velocity causing the shift. So larger shift implies larger velocity. So K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, but I thought K
