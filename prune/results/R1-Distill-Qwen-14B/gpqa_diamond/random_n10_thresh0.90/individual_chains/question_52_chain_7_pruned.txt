Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star that has some changes when spots cover part of its surface. So, when there are no spots, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find by what factor this ratio changesâ€”specifically, the ratio without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, right. So, the ratio N1/N2 (where N1 is the number in level 1 and N2 is in level 2) decreases when spots are present. So without spots, it's higher, and with spots, it's lower. We need the factor, which would be (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, but in the question, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, right? Because dark spots are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots cover a part, that part is cooler, but the rest is at the original temperature. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the total emission from the entire star is now that temperature. That's a bit confusing because the spots themselves are actually at a lower temperature, but the average Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, but maybe the way to think about this is that the star's photosphere as a whole, when 40% is covered, leads to an average Teff of 5500 K. So the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 when spots are present. So perhaps we can model this as the star's overall temperature being 5500 K when spots are present.

But the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So I think it's about the Boltzmann equation for populations. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(kT)), where E2 > E1. So the ratio is higher when the temperature is lower because the exponential factor becomes larger.

Wait, so when the temperature decreases (like from 6000 K to 5500 K), the exponential term increases. So the ratio N1/N2 would increase. But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. That's confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me think about the levels: level 1 and level 2. Let's say level 2 is higher in energy than level 1. So E2 > E1. Then the energy difference is delta E = E2 - E1.

The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Because in the Boltzmann factor, it's (E2 - E1) over kT. So when T is lower, the exponent becomes more negative, making the exponential smaller.

Wait, no: wait, I think I messed up. Let me write it correctly. The Boltzmann distribution is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ). So, if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller. So N2/N1 decreases. Which means N1/N2 increases.

Wait, but the question says that when spots are present, the ratio decreases. So without spots, N1/N2 is higher; with spots, it's lower. But according to this, when T decreases, N1/N2 increases. That's opposite to what the problem states. So perhaps I got the levels reversed.

Wait, perhaps I have the levels backwards. Maybe level 1 is higher in energy than level 2. Wait, that can't be right because, in that case, E2 - E1 would be negative, and the exponent would be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio N2/N1 when the temperature changes. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says: when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, the ratio (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots is greater than 1.

Wait, let me think again. The Boltzmann factor is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise.

The correct formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ). So N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). So when E2 > E1, the exponent is positive, so when T increases, the exponential increases.

So, for higher T, N1/N2 is larger. So, when spots are present, T is lower (5500 K), so N1/N2 should be lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (N1/N2) decreases. So yes, that makes sense. Because when T goes down, the N1/N2 ratio goes down.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the ratio decreases when the star has spots." So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So, that's correct because the temperature is lower.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. So perhaps each part of the photosphere (the non-spots and spots)
