Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and spring constant. But since this is relativistic, I need to consider how relativity affects the motion.

Wait, the problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. Oh right, relativistic effects come into play when speeds are significant compared to the speed of light. So the maximum speed won't be the same as the classical case.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), because the potential energy (½kA²) gets converted into kinetic energy (½mv²). But that's when speeds are much less than c.

But here, it's relativistic, so we can't use that formula. I think relativistic equations involve gamma factors. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But I'm a bit confused about how to connect this to the potential energy.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential: U = ½ k A².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So the total energy E is ½kA². But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just ½mv²; it's higher. 

So the total energy in relativity would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, the potential energy is considered as part of the system. Hmm, maybe I should set the total energy E equal to the potential energy at maximum amplitude, which is ½kA².

Wait, but in relativity, when the oscillator is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So:

At x = 0, kinetic energy = E_total. E_total is the same as the potential energy at x=A.

Wait, but in the classical case, E_total is ½kA². But in relativity, does that still hold? Or does the potential energy also get modified? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the potential energy. Or maybe the potential energy itself incorporates relativistic effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy U is still ½kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So when the oscillator is at x=A, the potential energy is ½kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. The total energy E is then ½kA². But the rest mass energy is mc², so the total energy is mc² plus the kinetic energy. Wait, that might not make sense because E_total would then be mc² plus something, but in the classical case, it's ½kA². So I'm confused.

Let me think again. If the system is a relativistic harmonic oscillator, perhaps the equations of motion and energies are modified. But maybe in this problem, the potential energy is treated classically, and the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So, at x=0, the kinetic energy is maximum. So E_total = K + U, where U is ½kA² and K is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no. At x=A, the system is at rest, so the kinetic energy is zero. The potential energy is ½kA². So E_total = ½kA².

But in relativity, when the oscillator is moving, the kinetic energy includes a gamma factor. So at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc², and the potential energy is zero. So E_total is equal to (gamma -1) mc².

But wait, E_total is the same in both cases. So at x=A, E = ½kA². At x=0, E = (gamma - 1) mc². So:

1/2 k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So gamma = 1 + (k A
