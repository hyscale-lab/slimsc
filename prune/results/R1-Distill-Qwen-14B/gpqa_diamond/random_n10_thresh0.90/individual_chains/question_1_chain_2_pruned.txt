Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, two quantum states with energies E1 and E2 have lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the lifetime of a state relates to the uncertainty in energy. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2, or something like that. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ℏ/2, but I think sometimes people approximate it as just ℏ because the constant factor is small.

So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state. The longer the lifetime (Δt), the smaller the uncertainty in energy. Wait, but wait, I think the lifetime here refers to the time over which the state is observed. Or is it the natural lifetime of the state? I think in this context, it refers to the natural lifetime, which is the mean lifetime of the state before it decays.

So each state has its own lifetime. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. I'm a bit confused because each state has its own uncertainty. But to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, I think. Because if the difference is too small, the uncertainties might overlap, making it hard to distinguish.

Wait, or maybe more accurately, for two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be larger than the combined uncertainty of both states. Because each state has its own uncertainty, so the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum. So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2. And the actual energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 should be greater than ΔE_total. 

But let me think again. Each state's energy has an uncertainty due to its lifetime. So for state 1, ΔE1 = ℏ/(2τ1), where τ1 is the lifetime. Similarly for state 2, ΔE2 = ℏ/(2τ2). So the total uncertainty is ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So to resolve the two states, we need ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Let me calculate each ΔE.

The lifetimes are τ1 = 1e-9 s and τ2 = 1e-8 s.

Compute ΔE1: ℏ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Wait, but often in these problems, they use units of eV·s. Let me remember the conversion: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So, ℏ in eV·s is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Because 1.05e-34 J·s * (1 eV / 1.6e-19 J) = 6.58e-16 eV·s.

So for ΔE1, it's ℏ/(2 τ1) = (6.582e-16) / (2 * 1e-9) ) eV.

Wait, let me compute that: 2e-9 is 2*1e-9, so denominator is 2e-9.

So 6.582e-16 / 2e
