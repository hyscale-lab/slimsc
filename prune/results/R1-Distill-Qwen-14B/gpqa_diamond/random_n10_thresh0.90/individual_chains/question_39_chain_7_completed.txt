Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that behaves under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis direction. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measured the particles' positions, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So, to find where the particles are, we need to compute |ψ(x)|² and integrate it over the region where the particles are found. Since the measurements didn't find any particles outside x=1 and x=3, that must mean the probability of finding the particle in regions x<1 and x>3 is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside of [1,3], right? Wait, no, because the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's not zero outside a certain region.

Wait, maybe the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is defined (non-zero) only in that interval. But the way the question is phrased, the wave function is given as that expression in a part of space where the particle can exist. So perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, and non-zero between 1 and 3.

But the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, that's a complex wave function. So the modulus squared would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2 because the imaginary part is 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. But wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. For a complex number, say ψ = A + Bi, then |ψ|² is A² + B². So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5 (since ψ = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i). So |ψ|² would be (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2, which is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, if the wave function is given as this expression in a part of space where the particle can exist, that suggests that outside this region, the wave function is zero. So the modulus squared is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. But wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The sqrt(1+x) suggests that 1+x must be positive, so x >= -1. But the measurements only found particles between x=1 and x=3, so probably, the wave function is zero outside this region. So this function must be non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. I'm a bit confused. If the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, then perhaps the expression is valid only in that region, and zero otherwise. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the wave function is such that the probability density outside 1 and 3 is zero. So the integral of |ψ|² from -infinity to 1 and from 3 to infinity must be zero.

Wait, but that's not possible because the wave function given has a non-zero imaginary component. Let me think again. Let me write the wave function as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Then, the probability density is |ψ|² = [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. Wait, no, because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is real, and the imaginary part is -0.5i. So when you compute |ψ|^2, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, right? Because the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5, so the square modulus is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|² over all x must be 1. But wait, the particles are only found between 1 and 3. So that implies that the wave function is zero outside that region. Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, the expression given for the wave function would have sqrt(1+x) defined for x >=-1, but the particle is only found between 1 and 3. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to 3. So the given wave function is only valid in that interval, and zero otherwise. So when we calculate the integral of |ψ|² from 1 to 3, it should equal 1 (normalization condition).

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. If that's the case, then the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x) + 0.25], right? Because (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 is a²/(1+x), and (-0.5)^2 is 0.25. So the probability density is a²/(1+x) +0.25.

Wait, but that can't be correct because if a is a real constant, then the integral of (a²/(1+x) +0.25) from x=1 to x=3 would be the sum of two integrals: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to3, plus 0.25 ∫ 1 dx from 1 to3.

Wait, but if the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3, then the integral of |ψ|² from -infty to infty would be the integral from 1 to3 of [a²/(1+x) +0.25] dx. And this must equal 1 for the wave function to be normalized.

So let's compute this integral. Let me write it as:

Integral (from 1 to 3) [ a²/(1+x) +0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3 + Integral [0.25] dx from 1 to3 = a² [ ln(1+x) ] from1 to3 + 0.25*(3-1).

Compute each part:

First term: a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), because ln(4)=2 ln(2), ln(2) is ln(2), so difference is ln(2).

Second term: 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the equation becomes:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.720.

Taking square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.720) ≈ 0.8485.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in calculating the integral? Let me double-check.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So from 1 to3: [ln(4) - ln(2)] = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So that's correct.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 /0.6931 ≈ 0.720 → a≈0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the given wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) and the fact that the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \). The probability density is given by \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \). 

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition requires that the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over this interval equals 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This can be split into two integrals:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first term, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \), the integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Thus:

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

2. For the second term, \( \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx \), the integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) is:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.720.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.720} \approx 0.8485.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
