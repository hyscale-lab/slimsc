Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator Ay is represented as a 2x2 matrix and satisfies the eigenvalue equation Ayφ = aφ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. 

They tell me that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So, I think S must be a spin matrix, probably related to the Pauli matrices. Wait, Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σx, σy, σz. Oh, right, σy is the Pauli matrix for y, which is exactly the matrix S given here. Because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S is σy.

So, Ay = c * σy, where c = h/(4π). Hmm, wait, angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are often expressed in terms of these Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh! Because the spin angular momentum S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, for instance, S_y = (ħ/2)σy. 

But here, Ay is given as c*S, and c is h/(4π). Let me compute c. Since h is Planck's constant, which is 2πħ. So h = 2πħ → h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. Therefore, Ay = (ħ/2) σy, which makes Ay = S_y, the y-component of the spin operator. Oh wait, because the spin operator S has components Sx, Sy, Sz, each being (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrix.

So, finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay is essentially finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Sy, the spin y-component operator for spin-½ particles.

Wait, what's the eigenvalue equation for Sy? It's Sy |ψ> = s_y |ψ>, where s_y can be ± ħ/2. Because for spin-½ particles, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues a of Ay should be ± ħ/2. Because Ay is Sy.

Wait, but the question says Ay = c * S, where c is h/(4π) and S is this matrix. Let me compute c*S. Since S is σy, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then:

c * S = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

But since h = 2πħ, substituting gives (2πħ/(4π)) = ħ/2. So c is ħ/2, so Ay = (ħ/2) σy = Sy. Yes, so the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. The options A and B talk about the eigenvalues. Let's see:

Option A: Imaginary part are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). That can't be right because eigenvalues of Ay should be real, since they are eigenvalues of an observable. Wait, no, wait: no, the eigenvalues of spin components are real because they're Hermitian operators.

Wait, wait, S is σy, which is a Hermitian matrix? No, wait. σy is actually Hermitian because σy† = σy. Because for σy, taking the conjugate transpose of [[0, -i],[i,0]] gives [[0,i],[-i, 0]], which is the same as σy, since i*(-i) is 1, etc. Wait, no, actually σy is Hermitian. So Ay = (ħ/2) σy is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues are real. So any option that says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong. Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues should be real. So the statement that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Imaginary parts are ±1/2, real parts ±1. Hmm, but again, eigenvalues should be real. So option B is also incorrect because it talks about the imaginary parts. So that leaves options C and D.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because sometimes, when people talk about the components of angular momentum, the eigenvalues are in units of ħ. So for spin ½,
