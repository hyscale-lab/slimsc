Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with high speeds close to the speed of light, I need to use special relativity, not classical mechanics. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

First, I think about the relative speed. In classical mechanics, I might just subtract the speeds, but since they're relativistic, that won't work. I remember that the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, the astronauts are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Use v_rel = (v2 - v1)/(1 - (v2 v1)/c²), but wait, wait, because relative velocity is tricky. Oh, wait, no. If the two are moving in the same direction, from the perspective of the one moving faster (A), the other (B) would appear to be moving slower. So maybe the formula should be (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). Let's compute that.

v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that: 0.6 *0.5 = 0.3, times c squared over c squared is 0.3. So denominator is 1 -0.3 =0.7. So v_rel is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c. So that's a start.

Now for the total energy of the system. I think each astronaut has their own relativistic energy, and the total is the sum. Remembering that the total energy E is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, moving at 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) =1/sqrt(0.64)=1/0.8=1.25.

E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 *2m c² =2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, 0.5c):

Gamma2 =1/sqrt(1 -0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)=approx 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c²=1.1547 *3 ≈3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 =2.5 +3.464=5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². That matches. Option D has E=5 mc², which is too low.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we use the principles of special relativity. The question involves finding the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Plugging in the values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).
- The total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\).

Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\).**
