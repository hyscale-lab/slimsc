Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect these two.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Right, because parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is the distance in parsecs. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The problem states that the number of stars N varies as 1 / plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). But since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that in. Let's do that: N ∝ 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Wait, because plx is 1/r, so 1/(plx^5) would be 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5? But wait, that can't be right. Because the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe I need to look at the rate of change of N with respect to r.

Hmm, maybe I should express N as a function of r. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, the number of stars as a function of distance. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the question is about the number of stars in that region of the sky as a function of distance. So if N ∝ r^5, then as r increases, N increases rapidly. But wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit volume or something like that. Wait, but the question says that the number varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since plx is 1/r, substituting gives N = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, that would mean that the number of stars increases as we go to larger distances, which seems counterintuitive because I thought that as you look
