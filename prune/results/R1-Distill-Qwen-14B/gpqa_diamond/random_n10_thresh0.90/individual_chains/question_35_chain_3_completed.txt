Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator, denoted as A_y, is given by c multiplied by a matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y, and then determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

Hmm. So, first, I think I should write out what the matrix A_y looks like. Let me compute that.

The matrix S is:
[  0   -i ]
[  i    0 ]

So, c is h/(4π). Therefore, A_y is c * S. Multiplying each element by c:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [ 0   -i ]
                [ i    0 ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, c is h/(4π), so each element of S is multiplied by this. So, computing each element:

Top left: 0 * c = 0
Top right: (-i) * c = -i * h/(4π)
Bottom left: i * c = i * h/(4π)
Bottom right: 0 * c = 0

So A_y matrix is:
[ 0           -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)    0         ]

So the matrix A_y is:

0         (-i h)/(4π)
(i h)/(4π)  0

To find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to solve the characteristic equation: det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

So, the matrix (A_y - a I) is:

[-a          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[(i h)/(4π)  -a         ]

The determinant is [(-a)(-a) ] - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(4π)^2 ) ]

Let me compute that term: (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (h²)/(4π)^2.

So the determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) ) = 0.

So, a² = h²/(16 π²)
=> a = ± h/(4 π)

So the eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Both are real. Wait, but all the options mention complex eigenvalues or real parts and imaginary parts. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalues are real in this case? Because the matrix A_y is a Hermitian matrix? Because S is a Hermitian matrix multiplied by a real scalar.

Wait, let me check: S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Is S Hermitian? Let me compute S† (the conjugate transpose). S† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S. So yes, S is Hermitian. Then c is a real scalar, so A_y is Hermitian. So A_y is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues should be real numbers.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That would imply the eigenvalues are complex, which can't be right because A_y is Hermitian. So option A can't be correct.

Option B says imaginary parts are ±1/2, and real parts ±1. But my calculation shows eigenvalues are purely real, so B is also not correct.

Options C and D: Let me think about them. Before that, perhaps I should compute eigenvectors as well.

But maybe the eigenvalues are real. So let's move on to the options.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component Az.

Well, since A is the angular momentum operator, which commutes with A². So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it should also be an eigenfunction of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0.

But what about Az? The Y and Z components don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So, φ being an eigenfunction of Ay may not be an eigenfunction of Az. So option C's statement is correct: φ can be eigenfunction of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what that means. Basis functions usually refer to the basis vectors in the Hilbert space. If Ay is a 2x2 matrix, then the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, but I'm not sure if D is making a correct statement. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator, but I'm not certain. So I need to think more about D.

But first, let's reevaluate the eigenvalues. Wait, earlier I thought the eigenvalues are real, so the options A and B, which have complex eigenvalues, are wrong. So the correct options must be either C or D.

Wait, let me double-check the eigenvalues. The matrix A_y is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real. So A and B are incorrect because their eigenvalues are complex. So options C and D remain.

So, moving on: Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is the square of the angular momentum operator, which commutes with Ay, any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². Because [Ay, A²] = 0.

But Az and Ay don't commute. So eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. The matrix operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it's acting on a two-dimensional space. The eigenvectors form a basis for this space, but the question is what the statement is saying. The statement says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I'm not entirely sure about this wording. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix's basis is the eigenvectors. So D might be correct, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, but the question is about which statement will be correct during the calculation. So perhaps we need to evaluate each option based on the properties.

So, for each option:

Option C: Correct, because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: Not sure. The statement is a bit unclear. If the basis functions are the eigenvectors, then yes, but the statement seems to suggest that the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator, which is true for any diagonalizable matrix. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues (±h/(4π)), it is diagonalizable. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but the options are presented as which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps D is correct in the sense that the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator's matrix representation.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The matrix Ay is 2x2, and it's diagonalizable because it has two distinct eigenvalues. So any vector in the space can be expressed in terms of its eigenvectors. So the statement in D says the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form the basis. That is correct because they are linearly independent and span the space.

So if both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one option is correct. Wait, but let's look at the options again.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But wait, the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps I made a mistake in reasoning.

Ah, perhaps I should look at the matrix S again. Wait, S is the same as the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by some factor. Let me think: the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So exactly the S matrix. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. Therefore, the operator A_y is c * Y, where Y is the Pauli matrix.

The eigenvalues of the Pauli Y matrix are ±1. So when multiplied by c, the eigenvalues become ±c, which is ±h/(4π). So eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), real, as we found earlier.

So, what about the eigenvectors. For the Pauli Y matrix, the eigenvectors are like |+y> and |-y> states, which are the eigenstates of Y. These are typically not eigenstates of sigma_z (the Pauli Z matrix) because Y and Z don't commute.

But what about A². A is the angular momentum operator, which in this case is a spin-½ particle (since muon has spin ½). So A^2 would be (ħ/2)(ħ/2 +1) * something? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the operator definitions.

Wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle has A² = (s(s+1)) ħ², where s=1/2.

Wait, A is the Y-component, but A² would be (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, A is the entire angular momentum vector, and A^2 would be the square of its magnitude.

But perhaps in the problem, the operator A is the Y-component, and the question is about whether the eigenfunctions of A_y are eigenfunctions of A².

But regardless, if A² commutes with A_y, then any eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A².

So for spin-½ particles, the square of the angular momentum is A^2 = (ħ/2)(ħ/2 +1) I, where I is the identity matrix. So A² is a multiple of the identity, so any vector is an eigenstate of A².

Wait, but if A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, then yes, any state is an eigenstate of A². So in that case, φ being an eigenstate of A_y would automatically be an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So, for option C, the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is the same for all states) but they are not eigenfunctions of Az, because A_y and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

What about option D? The statement says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

The matrix Ay is 2x2, so the space is two-dimensional. The eigenvectors form a basis for this space. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis for the matrix operator's representation. So option D is correct as well?

Wait, but wait. The statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the matrix operator is represented in a certain basis, and its eigenvectors are the basis functions. So the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are the basis for the operator's matrix.

But in quantum mechanics, operators are represented in a particular basis. If the operator is diagonal in that basis, then the basis vectors are the eigenvectors. So if Ay is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then those eigenvectors form the basis in which the matrix is diagonal.

In the given problem, the matrix S is given as the representation of the operator. But perhaps the eigenfunctions φ are the basis vectors for that matrix. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the basis functions refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which would be the eigenbasis. So the statement in D is correct.

Wait, but the options are to choose which is correct during the calculation. So, which of the options is correct?

Let me recap the options:

Option A: Eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But we know eigenvalues are real, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Same issue; eigenvalues are real, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct, because A² commutes with Ay, and Az does not.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

So both C and D seem correct. But looking back, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, the matrix given for S is a 2x2, but in quantum mechanics, the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a spin-1/2 particle would have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for each component. But in this problem, c is h/(4π), and S is the Pauli Y matrix (which has eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by i), but in our case, S is the Pauli Y matrix scaled by c.

Wait, earlier calculation: eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). So, for a spin-½ particle, the maximum eigenvalue for a component of angular momentum is ħ/2. Wait, ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So that aligns with our result. So the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, which is correct.

So, in that case, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay are the |+y> and |-y> states. These states are superpositions of the |+z> and |-z> states.

So, when considering option C, since A² is (A_x² + A_y² + A_z²) = (ħ²/4) (3) for a spin-½ particle, but wait, no—wait, for spin s, A² = s(s+1)ħ². For s=1/2, that's (3/4) ħ². So A² has a fixed value for all states, making any state an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the operator's matrix representation in its eigenbasis is diagonal, yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis. So D is correct as well. But the options are structured such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reevaluate the options.

Wait, option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. As we discussed, A²'s eigenfunctions are all possible states because A² is a multiple of identity. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: Whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator's matrix is in a certain basis, perhaps the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator's matrix. That is, the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So D is correct.

But in the options, only one can be correct. Perhaps I've made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, the question says, which statement is correct during the calculation.

Another approach: Let's compute the eigenvectors.

Given that the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Let's find the eigenvectors for a = h/(4π):

(Ay - a I) v = 0.

Matrix Ay - a I:

[ -a       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a ]

Substituting a = h/(4π):

[ -h/(4π)       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -h/(4π) ]

So the equations are:

- (h/(4π)) v1 + (-i h/(4π)) v2 = 0
(i h/(4π)) v1 - (h/(4π)) v2 = 0

Simplify the first equation by multiplying both sides by 4π/h:

- v1 - i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

Similarly, the second equation:

i v1 - v2 = 0 → i v1 = v2 → v1 = (1/i) v2 → since 1/i = -i, v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as [v1; v2] = [ -i v2; v2 ] = v2 [ -i; 1 ].

So the eigenvector is proportional to [ -i ; 1 ].

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the equations would lead to v1 = i v2, giving eigenvector [i; 1].

So the eigenvectors are [ -i ; 1 ] and [ i ; 1 ].

These vectors are in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are functions expressed in terms of the standard basis.

But the question is about the statements. So, for option D: the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

Wait, the matrix Ay is expressed in the standard basis. The eigenvectors are in that same basis. So when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, which is the same as the basis in which Ay is diagonal. So for the matrix operator Ay, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form the basis for the space in which the operator is represented. So D's statement is correct.

But earlier, I thought that both C and D are correct. But looking back, perhaps the problem is designed so that only one option is correct.

Wait, looking back at the options, let me read them again.

Option D says, "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, the matrix is given in the standard basis, but the eigenvectors are in that same basis. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for Ay's matrix, meaning they form the basis in which Ay is diagonal. So D's statement is correct.

But wait, the eigenvectors are the basis for the operator's matrix representation? Or are they just a basis for the space?

Wait, the matrix Ay is in the standard basis. The eigenvectors are in that same basis. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are basis functions for the operator's matrix. So D is correct.

Hmm, but earlier I thought that C is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should count on the correct answer being option C.

Wait, no. Let me think. The options are presented as a multiple choice, and only one is correct.

Wait, option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is an eigenfunction of A².

But what about the actual form of A²? A² is (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. Wait, but for a spin-½ particle, A² is a constant, as A² = (ħ/2)(ħ/2 +1) * I. So any state is an eigenstate of A² with eigenvalue (3/4) ħ².

So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², which makes option C correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator's matrix. Since the matrix is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, D is correct.

But in the options, only one can be correct. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the reasoning for D.

Wait, the statement in D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." I'm not entirely sure what this implies. The matrix operator's basis is the standard basis in which it's given. So the eigenvectors are in that same basis. So perhaps the eigenfunctions are the basis, but that's not necessarily what the statement is saying.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions are the basis for the operator's matrix representation. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

The eigenvalues are real and ±h/(4π). So none of the options A or B are correct because they involve complex eigenvalues.

So the correct options must be either C or D.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Also correct.

But the problem states "which statement will you consider to be correct," implying only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. The matrix is given in a particular basis (probably the computational basis, with basis vectors |0> and |1>). The eigenvectors are in that same basis, hence the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the basis functions are the basis vectors in the Hilbert space. So if the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis, then D is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct statements. But looking back, the options are:

A) ... [incorrect]

B) ... [incorrect]

C) ... [correct]

D) ... [correct?]

But the options might not have both correct. So perhaps I should re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says "the operator Ay has the form Ay = c·S; where c = h/(4π) and S is a 2×2 matrix."

Wait, the matrix S is given, so Ay is formed by that. The eigenvectors are what we found.

So, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions for the operator's matrix. So D's statement is correct.

Hmm, but in that case, both C and D are correct statements. But since the options are A to D, and the question expects only one correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps option D's statement is incorrect because the basis functions of the matrix operator are the standard basis vectors, not the eigenvectors.

Wait, the matrix operator is given in a certain basis. The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors in that basis. So the statement in D is correct.

But I'm getting stuck between C and D.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is not correct because the basis functions are the basis vectors in which the matrix is diagonal, but the given matrix is in the standard basis, not necessarily the diagonal basis.

Wait, the given matrix for Ay is in the standard basis, perhaps. The eigenvectors are in that basis, but the matrix in the eigenbasis would be diagonal.

So the statement D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. So in the eigenbasis, the operator is diagonal, and the basis is the eigenfunctions. So D's statement is correct.

Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but given the options, I think option C is correct.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the dimensionality.

The operator A_y is a 2x2 matrix, so it's acting on a two-dimensional space. The eigenvectors form a basis for this space. So the statement in D is correct because the eigenfunctions are indeed a basis for the operator's matrix.

So, perhaps the correct options are C and D. But the options are presented as either/or, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question says "which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation." So perhaps both C and D are correct, but only one is an option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: "The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az."

Option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

But according to our analysis, both C and D are correct. But in reality, only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in reasoning about option D. The matrix operator's basis functions refer to the basis in which the operator is represented, which is the standard basis. The eigenvectors are in that same basis, so they can form a basis for the operator's matrix.

So perhaps D is correct.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps it's better to proceed to the conclusion.


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component angular momentum operator \( A_y \), which is represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix. The operator is given by \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix with the first row \( (0, -i) \) and the second row \( (i, 0) \). The task is to determine which of the provided statements (A to D) is correct during the calculation.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is identical to the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). When scaled by \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) become \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. This rules out options A and B, as they describe complex eigenvalues.

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \) are calculated to be proportional to \( [-i, 1] \) and \( [i, 1] \), respectively. These eigenvectors form a basis for the two-dimensional space.

3. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), as \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), since \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute. This makes option C correct.

4. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of \( A_y \) are indeed a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) space in which the operator is defined. This makes option D correct as well.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are factually correct. However, the question implies that only one statement is correct. Since option C directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), it is more relevant to the problem's focus.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

Answer: C
