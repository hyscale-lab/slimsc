Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions, right? Because it's got dx and dy, so maybe it's a 2D surface. But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface in hyperbolic geometry. Pseudosphere usually has a metric that's similar to the Poincaré disk model, I think.

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)]² (dx² + dy²), but wait, that's for the Beltrami-Klein model. Or was it the Poincaré model? Oh right, the Poincaré disk model has ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)]² (dx² + dy²). Oh wait, but our given metric is different. Let me write it out: 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is 4 minus (x² + y²). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should compare it to the standard pseudosphere metric. The standard pseudosphere (like the tractricoid) has a metric that's proportional to 1/(1 + (x² + y²))², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in the Poincaré disk model, the conformal factor is 2/(1 - r²) where r is the radius in the disk. Wait, the given metric's denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So that's like 4(1 - (r²)/4), where r² = x² + y².

So maybe this metric is similar to a scaled version of the Poincaré disk. Let me see: the given metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²). Let's factor out 4 from the denominator: 32/(4(1 - r²/4)) ) = 8/(1 - r²/4). So the conformal factor is 8/(1 - (r²)/4). Hmm, that's different from the standard Poincaré, which is 2/(1 - r²). But perhaps it's just scaled differently.

In any case, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? The area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is 4π r², similar to a sphere. Because for a sphere of radius r, the area is 4π r². But wait, for a pseudosphere, does it have finite area? Or is it infinite? Hmm, no, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. I think the tractricoid, which is the pseudosphere, has finite area.

Wait, but what's the metric? Let me think in terms of surface area. The area element in 2D is given by the determinant of the metric. For a 2D metric ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2 g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the area element is sqrt(g_{xx} g_{yy} - (g_{xy})²) dx dy. In our case, the metric is diagonal because there's no cross term, right? So g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))² times (dx dy). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - r²)]² dx dy.

Wait, no. Wait, the area element for 2D is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is (32/(4 - r²))^2, so the area element is (32/(4 - r²))^2 dx dy. Hmm, but wait, that's in terms of the coordinates. So to find the total area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined.

Wait, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), so the region where this is defined is when 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2, since 4 is 2². So the integration is over the disk of radius 2.

So the area A would be the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - r²)]² dx dy, where r² = x² + y². Let's switch to polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So substituting, A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)]² * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. Let's factor out the constants. Let me compute [32]² = 1024. So A = 1024 ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫(r=0 to 2) [1/(4 - r²)]^2 * r dr.

The integral over θ is 2π. So A = 1024 * 2π ∫(r=0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²)^2 ] dr.

Now, compute the integral ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r²)^2. Let me make substitution u =4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr. When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [ (-du/2) / u^2 ].

Which is (-1/2) ∫ from 4 to 0 u^{-2} du.

But reversing the limits, it's (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 u^{-2} du.

The integral of u^{-2} is -u^{-1}, so:

(1/2) [ -1/u ] from 0 to4. Wait, but plugging in u=4 gives -1/4, and u approaching 0 is -infinity. Hmm, that's a problem. So the integral becomes (1/2) [ (-1/4) - (-∞) ].

Wait no, wait. Let me re-examine the substitution. When r approaches 2, u approaches 0.

Wait, when r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 =0. So the limits are from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2). So the substitution gives:

∫ from u=4 to u=0 [ (-du/2) / u² ] = (1/2) ∫ from u=0 to u=4 (1/u²) du.

Wait, because when you switch the limits, the negative sign flips them. So the integral becomes (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) u^{-2} du.

But ∫ u^{-2} du = -u^{-1} + C.

So evaluating from 0 to4: [ -1/u ] from 0 to4.

At u=4: -1/4.

At u=0: approaching from positive side, 1/u approaches +infinity, so -1/u approaches -infinity.

So the integral becomes (1/2) [ (-1/4) - (-∞) ) ] → (1/2)(∞ ), which is infinity. So the integral diverges. So the area A is 1024 * 2π * ∞ → infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the pseudosphere should have finite area. Or does it? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the entire hyperbolic plane has infinite area. But a pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the models.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Because the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), which is similar to the standard Poincaré disk model's conformal factor.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk model is ds² = [4/(1 - r²)]^2 (dx² + dy²), where r is the radius in the model. So if we compare, the given metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me factor that as 32/(4 (1 - (r²)/4 )) → 8/(1 - (r²)/4 ). So 8/(1 - (r²)/4 )^2? Wait, no. Wait, the original is 32/(4 - r²) = 8/(1 - r²/4 ). So maybe it's scaled.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric represents a space with a certain curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = λ² (dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(2λ)) d²λ/dr², where r is the radial coordinate.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, for a metric ds² = f(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = -(1/(2 f²)) [ (f')' / f ]' ?

Hmm, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the area element again.

Wait, the area element we found was (32/(4 - r²))^2 r dr dθ. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫∫ [ (32)^2 r ] / (4 - r²)^4 dr dθ.

But when I did the substitution, the integral from 0 to2 of r/(4 - r²)^2 dr turned into an integral that diverges. So the area would be infinite. But that's conflicting with what I thought about the pseudosphere.

Wait, but perhaps the given metric isn't actually representing a closed surface. Or perhaps it's a different model. Let me think again. The given metric is defined on a disk of radius 2. The area element calculation suggests that the area is infinite, but that can't be right for a pseudosphere.

Wait, but is the given metric correct for a pseudosphere? Let's compare.

A pseudosphere has Gaussian curvature K = -1 in the tractricoid model. The metric for the tractricoid, I think, is ds² = (a²/(a² + r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where a is a constant related to the curvature.

Alternatively, another form is ds² = (r² / (a² + r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is ds² = [4/(1 - r²)]^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), which has Gaussian curvature K = -1. So in the given metric, the conformal factor is 32/(4 - r²), which can be written as 8/(1 - (r²)/4 ). So it's similar to the Poincaré disk but scaled differently.

If the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, then the area would indeed be infinite, but the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a finite area surface. Wait, but maybe the question is about the entire hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area.

But the question says, "What is the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2?" So perhaps I'm miscalculating the area.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given metric is not the standard one for the pseudosphere. Maybe it's a different parameterization. Let's think about the area element again.

Wait, the area element in the metric is [32/(4 - r²)]² r dr dθ. So integrating from r=0 to r=2 (since 4 - r² =0 at r=2). So the area is ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫(r=0 to 2) [ (32)^2 r ] / (4 - r²)^4 dr.

Wait, no, [32/(4 - r²)]^2 is 1024 / (4 - r²)^2. So the area element is 1024 r / (4 - r²)^2 dr dθ.

So the integral becomes: 1024 * 2π ∫(0 to2) [ r / (4 - r²)^2 ] dr.

Let me compute ∫ r/(4 - r²)^2 dr from 0 to2.

Let me make substitution u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr. So r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So ∫ [r/(u^2)] dr = ∫ [ (r dr) / u² ] = ∫ [ (-du/2) / u² ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ u^(-2) du from 4 to0.

= (-1/2) [ (-1/u) ] from 4 to0.

= (-1/2) [ (-1/0) + (1/4) ) ].

Wait, 1/0 is infinity. So this becomes (-1/2)(-infty + 1/4) → (-1/2)(-infty) → positive infinity. So the integral diverges, which means the area is infinite. But that can't be right for a pseudosphere. So perhaps the answer is D) +infty.

Wait, but I thought the pseudosphere has finite area. Hmm. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the given metric is for the entire hyperbolic plane. Because the Poincaré disk model covers the entire hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the given metric is for a hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. So the area would be infinite, meaning the answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This is a 2D metric defined on a disk of radius 2, where \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\). The metric resembles a conformally flat metric, with the conformal factor \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we compute the area element:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \(\det g\) is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal (\(g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\) and \(g_{xy} = 0\)), the determinant is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area element is:

\[
dA = \frac{1024}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{1024 \, r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The integral over \(\theta\) gives \(2\pi\), so:

\[
A = 1024 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\). When \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\), and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{(4 - r^2)^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{-du}{u^2} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u^2}.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{du}{u^2}\) evaluates to \(-\frac{1}{u}\). Substituting the limits:

\[
\int_0^4 \frac{du}{u^2} = \left[-\frac{1}{u}\right]_0^4 = -\frac{1}{4} - (-\infty) = \infty.
\]

Thus, the radial integral diverges, leading to:

\[
A = 1024 \cdot 2\pi \cdot \infty = \infty.
\]

This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite. This result aligns with the fact that the given metric represents the hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
