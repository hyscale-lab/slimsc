Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The question is about a star that's the same size as the Sun. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

The setup is that when this star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. This causes changes in the star's brightness as observed through photometry. The problem says that this situation can look a lot like an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing dips in brightness. But the question is, if the star didn't have these spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same change in brightness (the same amplitude in the light curve)?

So, the task is to find the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star, Rpl/Rstar. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the change in brightness (the dip) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because it's the area blocked that causes the dip, and area scales with the square of the radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness doesn't dip as much as it would if a planet were covering a part of the star's disk. Because the spots are darker, but when they're on the side facing us, they contribute less light. So the observed brightness variation is due to the spots' contribution changing as the star rotates.

Wait, no. Let me think. When the star rotates, the spots come into view. The spots are cooler, so the total light from the star would decrease when spots are visible. But the way the question is phrased, the photometric observations will show periodic variations because of the rotation modulation. But the problem is that without the spots, what planet would cause the same signal. So we need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to what a planet would cause.

Wait, but without spots, brightness variations from the star would be due to the planet blocking part of the star. So the problem is asking, when the star has spots, the brightness variation is similar to what a planet would cause. So we need to calculate the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same brightness change as the spots do.

Alternatively, perhaps the star's brightness variation due to the spots is the same as a planet blocking part of the star. So the brightness dip from the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and the brightness variation from the spots is some function based on their size and temperature difference.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the change in flux. The total flux from the star is normally F0. When the spots are visible, the flux is lower. The change in flux (delta F) is the difference between F0 and the flux when spots are visible.

But let's think in terms of the star's surface. The star has spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the spots cover 20% of that, which is 10% of the entire star's surface. Because 20% of half is 10% of the whole.

Wait, maybe not. The filling factor is 20% per hemisphere. So if one hemisphere is spotty, and each spot covers 20% of that hemisphere, then the total area covered by spots is 20% of (π R^2 / 2) ), because each hemisphere is half the surface area of the sphere. So, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R^2/2) = 0.1 π R^2. So the total spot area is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but the spots are cooler. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and the flux we receive is the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The star's total flux is F = σ Teff^4 * 4π R^2 / (4π D^2) ), but I think in terms of relative brightness, we can model it as F0 = σ Teff^4 * (4π R^2) / (4π D^2) ) = σ Teff^4 (R^2 / D^2). So the flux is proportional to R^2 Teff^4.

When spots are present, the flux from the spots is lower. Let me model this.

The star's surface without spots has flux F0 per unit area. The spots have a lower temperature, so their flux per unit area is F_spot = σ (Teff - ΔT)^4. So ΔT is 1000 K, so T_spot is 5000 K.

The total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be:

F_spotted = (F0 * (1 - filling factor) ) + (F_spot * filling factor )

Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots, which is 20% or 0.2. So for the hemisphere, the unspotted part is 80%, and the spotted is 20%.

So the flux from the hemisphere is:

F_hemi = F0 * (1 - 0.2) + F_spot * 0.2

Because the hemisphere is half the star, the other hemisphere is unspotted. So the total flux is:

F_total = (F_hemi) + (F0 * (π R^2 / 2 )) + ... wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the star's total area is 4π R^2. The hemisphere not covered by spots is the other half, which is 2π R^2. But wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the hemisphere with spots contributes F0*(0.8) * (area of hemisphere) + F_spot*(0.2) * (area of hemisphere). The other hemisphere is normal, so F0 * (area of hemisphere).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The entire star has an area of 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R². One hemisphere (half the star) is covered 20% in spots. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The rest of that hemisphere is unspotted, 0.8 * 2π R² = 1.6 π R². The other hemisphere is entirely unspotted, contributing 2π R² * F0.

So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us is the sum of:

- The unspotted part of the spotted hemisphere: 1.6 π R² * F0
- The spotted part of the spotted hemisphere: 0.4 π R² * F_spot
- The other hemisphere: 2 π R² * F0

So total flux, F = (1.6 + 2) π R² F0 + 0.4 π R² (F_spot - F0) )

Which simplifies to F = (3.6 π R² F0) + 0.4 π R² (F_spot - F0)

= 3.6 F0 + 0.4 (F_spot - F0) ) * π R²

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to
