Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me try to think through this. 

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's index of refraction. Oh right, the formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

Oh, right! This is probably a case where we need to consider the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to the observer, their speeds don't just add up linearly. I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but I'm not entirely sure how that applies here.

Wait, but in this case, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed in the glass is u = c/n, but we need to find what the observer measures.

Wait no, actually, the light is already in the glass, so its speed relative to the glass is c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame (the glass's frame), and u' is the velocity as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but wait a second. The light's speed relative to the glass is u = c/n. Because the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, which is the lab frame.

Wait, to clarify: In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = c/n. So in the lab frame, where the glass is moving at velocity v, we need to find the speed of the light.

Wait, no, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. The glass is moving towards the observer, so in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v in the direction of the light beam. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement.

Wait, but the light's speed in the glass frame is v_light = c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at speed v relative to the glass, the light's speed would be higher. But how?

I think the formula is (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)). So u is the speed of light in the glass frame, which is c/n. And v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab, which is v.

Wait, but wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, so the observer is in the lab. So the glass's velocity is v in the lab frame. The light's velocity in the glass frame is c/n, which is in the direction of v. So in the lab frame, the light's velocity u' would be ( (c/n) + v ) divided by (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² ) )

Simplify that denominator: (1 + (v/(n c)) )

So putting it together, u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + (v/(n c)) )

Hmm, let's factor out c from numerator and denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by c: [ (c/n + v) * c ] / [ ( (1) + v/(n c) ) * c ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's easier to just manipulate the expression. Let me write it as:

u' = [ ( (c/n) + v ) ] / (1 + (v (c/n) ) / c² ) )

Simplify the denominator:

1 + (v c)/(n c² ) = 1 + v/(n c )

So u' = (c/(n) + v ) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Hmm. Let me factor out 1/(n) from the numerator.

Wait, numerator is (c + n v)/n. So,

u' = (c + n v)/n divided by (1 + v/(n c) )

Which is (c + n v)/(n) * 1/(1 + v/(n c))

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c to eliminate denominators.

Denominator becomes (n c + v )

So,

u' = (c + n v ) / (n) * (n c) / (n c + v )

Hmm, wait let me compute this step by step. Let me compute numerator and denominator:

After factoring, the numerator is (c + n v) * n c, and the denominator is n (n c + v)

Wait,
