Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The problem states that I need to calculate the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh right, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are like the special vectors that only change by a scalar when the operator is applied. So, the operator here is P, which has components Px, Py, and Pz.

Wait, the operator P is along a direction n in the x-z plane. So, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. That probably means it's a direction given by some angle theta, maybe. Oh, right, in spherical coordinates, if it's in the x-z plane, then the angle phi (azimuthal) would be 0 because it's along x, but wait no, in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or 180, depending on direction. But in general, any direction in x-z would have phi=0 or pi. But perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, for example, Px is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], Py is (ħ/2)*[[0,-i],[i,0]], and Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]].

Wait, but for any arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, the operator P can be expressed as a combination of these components. Oh, right! Since the direction is in the x-z plane, the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no, the x-z plane would have φ=0 or π, because y-component is zero. So, n would be along the x-z plane, meaning direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Wait, more accurately, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, so n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so sinθ sinφ =0. That would happen when φ=0 or
