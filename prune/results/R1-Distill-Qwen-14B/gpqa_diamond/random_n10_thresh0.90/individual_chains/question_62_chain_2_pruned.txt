Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me try to break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me draw its structure. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the cyclohexane. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group, so a formyl group somewhere.

Wait, the name is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The 1-position (which is adjacent to the aldehyde) has a substituent: cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

So, the structure is cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO) at one carbon, and at the adjacent carbon (carbon 1), there's a CH group attached to a cyclohexyl, a hydroxyl, and another CH2 maybe? Wait, no. Let me think. The substituent on carbon 1 is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl. So, the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent at position 1: (CH2-cyclohexyl-OH)CH2-CHO? Or maybe it's more like the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Wait, the substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So it's a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the main ring is cyclohexane. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same carbon as the aldehyde. So the aldehyde is on carbon 1, which is also connected to the CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a formyl group on C1, and on C1, there's also a CH group that's attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. Wait, maybe it's more
