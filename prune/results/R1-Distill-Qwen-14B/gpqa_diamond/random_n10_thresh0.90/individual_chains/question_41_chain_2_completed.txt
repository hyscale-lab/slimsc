Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a light beam propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction. So the light is moving through the glass which itself is moving. I remember that when dealing with velocities in different frames, we might need to use some sort of velocity addition, like from special relativity.

In a medium like glass, the speed of light isn't c, right? It's c divided by the refractive index, n. So normally, the speed would be c/n. But here, the medium itself is moving.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, the velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + u*v/c²), but wait, that's when you're transforming between frames moving relative to each other at velocity v. But the medium here is moving through the lab frame, and the light is in the medium. So perhaps the speed of the light in the medium is u = c/n in the rest frame of the glass. Then, from the lab frame, which is moving with the glass, how does that translate?

Wait, no, the lab frame is the one where the glass is moving. So the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer in the lab. So the lab is our stationary frame, and the glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab, in the same direction as the light beam.

Wait, but the light is inside the glass, which is moving. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. In the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, the light's speed would be... Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the lab frame. The glass is moving at speed v towards the observer, and the light is coming through the glass in the same direction. So from the lab's perspective, the speed of the light should be affected by both the glass's motion and the medium's properties.

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But from the lab frame, moving at v relative to the glass, the speed would be... Oh, right, the velocity addition formula applies here. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be (u + v)/(1 + u*v/c²), where u is c/n.

But wait, v is the speed of the medium relative to the lab. So if the medium is moving towards the lab, and the light is moving in the same direction as the medium, then in the lab frame, the light's speed might be higher than c/n? Or is it lower?

Wait, let me clarify the directions. The glass is moving towards the observer (so if the observer is in the lab, the glass is moving towards them). The light beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement, towards the observer. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. But the glass itself is moving towards the observer at v. So how does that combine?

In the lab frame, the light's velocity would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass, but relativistically. So using the velocity addition formula: u_lab = (u_glass + v) / (1 + (u_glass * v)/c²).

But wait, u_glass is the velocity of the light in the glass's frame. So u_glass = c/n. And v is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab. So substituting, u_lab = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n)*v / c² ). Simplify denominator: 1 + v/(n c).

So u_lab = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ 1 + v/(n c) ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator again. The denominator is 1 + (u_glass * v)/c². So u_glass is c/n, so (c/n)*v / c² = v/(n c).

So the denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c). So denominator is (n c + v)/(n c).

Putting it all together, u_lab = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ].

Dividing these fractions: multiply numerator by reciprocal of denominator.

So [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ].

The n in the numerator and denominator cancels out. So [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but the numerator is (c + n v) * c? Let me see:

Wait, [ (c + n v) ] * [ c ] = c^2 + n v c.

Denominator is (n c + v) = c (n) + v. Hmm, is there a way to factor this? Let me write denominator as (n c + v) = c (n) + v. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:

Wait, numerator c^2 + n v c = c (c + n v) = c (n v + c) = same as denominator's (n c + v) but wait, denominator is (n c + v) = (c n + v) = same as (n v + c) if v is same as n v? No, not quite. Wait, wait, no, denominator is n c + v. So it's not the same as the numerator's (c +n v) multiplied by anything.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the expression.

Wait, the numerator after substituting is (c + n v) multiplied by c, and the denominator is (n c + v). So:

u_lab = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v)

Wait, but that's c (c + n v) over (n c + v). Hmm. Let me see if I can factor that. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out c from denominator.

Denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v. Hmm, maybe I can factor out c: c (n + v/c).

Wait, that would be c*(n + v/(c)).

So denominator: c (n + v/c).

Numerator: c (c + n v) = c² + c n v.

Wait, perhaps I can write the entire expression as:

u_lab = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ c (n + v/c) ) ]

The c in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving:

(c + n v) / (n + v/c )

Wait, but v/c is a small term, but perhaps I can write this as (c + n v ) / ( (n c + v)/c )

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in the denominator earlier. Let me re-express the denominator.

Wait, denominator was n c + v. So I can factor out c: c (n + v/(c)).

So, denominator = c (n + v/(c)).

So, u_lab becomes [ (c + n v) * c ] / [ c (n + v/(c)) ) ].

Wait, no, because the numerator is:

[ (c + n v) * c ] comes from [ (c + n v) /n ] multiplied by [n c / (n c + v) ].

Wait, perhaps I should take a step back.

Alternative approach: The speed of light in the glass is c/n, but when the glass is moving towards the observer, we have to consider relativistic velocity addition.

So, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed u = c/n towards the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer at speed v in the lab frame. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, yes, that's the formula. So substituting u = c/n:

u' = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ]

Because the denominator is (1 + v/(n c)) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So putting it all together:

u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in numerator and denominator cancels:

u' = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Now, let's see if we can factor anything here. Let me factor out c in the denominator:

Denominator: n c + v = c (n) + v. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 1/c to see if it helps.

Wait, numerator is (c + n v) * c = c² + c n v.

Denominator is c (n) + v = c n + v.

Wait, perhaps factor the denominator as (c n + v) and numerator as c (c + n v).

Wait, so u' = [ c (c + n v) ] / (c n + v )

Hmm, can we factor (c + n v) with (c n + v)? Let's see.

(c + n v) = c + n v. Multiply by n: n c + n² v.

But the denominator is n c + v. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as v + n c, and the numerator as c^2 + n v c.

Wait, another approach: Let's factor the denominator as (v + n c) = v (1 + n c/v). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can factor numerator and denominator terms:

c^2 + n v c = c (c + n v)

Denominator: n c + v.

So, u' = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out a 'c' in the denominator:

Denominator: c (n) + v = c (n) + v.

So, u' = [c (c + n v)] / [ c n + v ]

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as [c (c + n v)] / [ c n + v ] = [ c (c + n v) ] / (c n + v )

Wait, let me think about it. Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator: c n + v = c n + v.

Hmm, I don't see an obvious way to simplify this further. So perhaps it's better to just leave it as is. Wait, but looking at the options, the options are in terms of n and v. Let me see the options:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v) → but that's dimensionless, but speed should be in terms of c, which is 1 here.

Wait, c is taken as 1 in the problem. So the speed should be a fraction of c. So in our expression, u' is [c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v ), but with c=1, that becomes [ (1 + n v) ] / (n + v) ) * (1) / (1) ?

Wait no, wait. Wait, with c=1, let's substitute.

So u' when c=1 is [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / (n * 1 + v ) → (1 + n v)/(n + v) → which is option A.

Wait, but wait, what? So when I substitute c=1, my expression becomes:

u' = [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / (n + v )

Which is (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Looking at the options, that's option A.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck.

Wait, when c=1, the expression becomes:

u' = [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / (n*1 + v ) → numerator is 1 + n v, denominator is n + v.

So u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So that's option A.

Wait, but I thought the speed in the medium is c/n, so if the medium is moving towards you, the light should be approaching you faster. So when the medium is moving in the same direction as the light, the speed should be higher than c/n.

Wait, for example, if v is positive (moving towards observer in same direction as light), then when v is positive, (1 +n v)/(n +v) → Let's plug in some numbers. Suppose n=1, v=0. So speed would be 1/1 =1, which is correct.

If n=1 and v=0.5, then (1+1*0.5)/(1 +0.5) = 1.5/1.5=1 → speed is 1, which is c. But that's when the medium is moving at v=0.5c. Hmm, but in reality, according to relativity, the speed shouldn't exceed c. Oh, but the problem says to take c=1, so it's correct.

Wait, but according to our calculation, when the medium is moving towards you at v, the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 +n v)/(n +v). So when n=1 and v=0.5, the speed is (1 + 0.5)/(1.5) = 1.5/1.5=1, which is c. So that's correct.

Another test case: v=0. Then u' = (1 +0)/(n +0) =1/n, which is correct, the speed in the medium.

Another test case: n approaches infinity (like a medium where light stops), but that might not be a useful case.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through a glass medium with refractive index \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer.

In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum. To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = \frac{c}{n} \) into the formula, we get:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{\frac{c}{n} v}{c^2} = 1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression for \( u' \) becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n c}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n c \) to simplify:

\[
u' = \frac{c + n v}{n + v}
\]

Since the problem specifies \( c = 1 \), the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer becomes:

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option **A**. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or fail to simplify correctly.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A)** \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \): Correct, as derived above.
- **B)** \( 1 \): Incorrect, as this would imply the speed of light is always \( c \), regardless of the medium or motion.
- **C)** \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \): Incorrect, as the denominator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.
- **D)** \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \): Incorrect, as the numerator does not match the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
