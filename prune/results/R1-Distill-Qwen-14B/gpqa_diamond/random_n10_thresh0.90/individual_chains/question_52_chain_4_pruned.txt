Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. So, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. They're looking at the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the ratio N1/N2 (number of atoms in level 1 over level 2) is being considered. They observe that this ratio decreases when spots are present. So, normally, without spots, N1/N2 is higher, and when the star has spots, it's lower. The question is about the factor by which it changes—so (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

The transition between these levels is at approximately 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. Wait, but wait. The star's photosphere is in LTE, so we can use the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is:

N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the two levels.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

So the ratio N1/N2 would be the inverse: (N1/N2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the ratio when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. But wait, the spots are dark, which means they are cooler regions on the star's surface. So when spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall effective temperature drops to 5500K. But wait, wait. The effective temperature is an average, but the star's photosphere is in LTE, which I think implies that the temperature is uniform? Or does each region (spot and non-spot) have its own temperature?

Wait a minute, the problem says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But wait, does that mean that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present? Or do the spots have a lower temperature, and the rest of the surface is still at 6000 K?

Oh, the question says that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So that's an average. But when considering the photosphere, each part (spot and non-spot) would have their own contributions to the overall spectrum.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region is in thermal equilibrium. But when spots are present, the star's overall Teff is lower, but the photosphere's temperature varies across the surface.

Wait, but how does that affect the observed ratio of Ti atoms? The line formation is in the photosphere. So the presence of spots would change the overall average temperature of the photosphere as observed. Or perhaps, the star's photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. But for the purpose of this problem, maybe we can model it as a single temperature, the effective temperature. Because the question says that the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered.

Wait, but no. Because the effective temperature is an average based on the total luminosity
