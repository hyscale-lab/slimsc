Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal gives v_max² = (kA²)/m, leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case.

But the question here is about a relativistic scenario. So I need to consider how relativity affects things. In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I guess I can't just equate the potential energy to the non-relativistic kinetic energy anymore.

So the total energy in this system must include both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Wait, but the potential energy in the harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, all its energy should be potential. As it moves towards equilibrium, that potential energy converts into kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the total energy might be higher than just mc² plus the rest.

Wait, no, the oscillator's total energy should be the sum of its rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. So the total energy E_total is mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA², so the total energy would be (1/2)kA² + (1/2)mv_max². So in the relativistic case, E_total is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, which would be mc² + (gamma - 1)mc². Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation.

Let me try to model this. At maximum displacement A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero because the oscillator is at rest at that point, right? So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, that's only if the oscillator doesn't have any rest mass energy to account for. No, wait, the rest mass energy is mc², so the total energy would be mc² plus the potential energy (1/2)kA². Oh, no, wait, that doesn't make sense because at maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero, but the potential is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA² + mc².

Wait, that can't be right, because in non-relativistic cases, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and the total energy would be (1/2)kA². So where does mc² fit in? Oh, perhaps in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the total energy is E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all that potential energy has been converted into kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy at that point would be (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So maybe setting (gamma - 1)mc² = (1/2)kA².

So let's write that equation:

(gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A².

Hmm, but let me think again. At maximum displacement, the oscillator has zero velocity, so its total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and potential energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, so E = mc² + K.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the potential energy is (1/2)kA² when x=A, but when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the kinetic energy would be (1/2)kA². But no, that's the non-relativistic thinking. Wait, in a relativistic scenario, the potential energy might be different, but the problem states that it follows Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², I think. So the setup is similar, but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So when the oscillator is at x=A, its velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, so E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

When it's at x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic: E = mc² + K.

Wait, but if E is the same in both situations, then:

At x=A: E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At x=0: E = mc² + K.

So K = (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1)mc².

So:

(gamma - 1)mc² = (1/2)k A².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but let me write that as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that can't be correct because when (k A²)/(2 m c²) is large, gamma becomes much larger than 1, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by considering the total energy in terms of gamma. So the total energy E is gamma mc². Because gamma includes the rest energy and the kinetic energy.

So when the oscillator is at x=A, E is (1/2)k A² + mc². So,

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)k A².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, but gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the speed we're trying to find. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for v.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it B. So,

gamma = 1 + B.

Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B.

Taking reciprocal on both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + B).

Square both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

v²/c² = [ (1 + B)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + B)^2.

Expanding (1 + B)^2:

= 1 + 2B + B².

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + 2B + B²) - 1 ] / (1 + B)^2
= (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2.

Factor numerator:

= B(2 + B) / (1 + B)^2.

But let me check if this is correct.

Wait, I think another approach could be to write the equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A²
