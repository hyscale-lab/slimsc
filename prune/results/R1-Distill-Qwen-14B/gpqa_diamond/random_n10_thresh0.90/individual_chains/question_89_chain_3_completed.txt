Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product formed is a light yellow solid, product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

Wait, I'll need to break this down into each step. Let's think about each reaction.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, and since there are bromines on carbons 1 and 3, when treated with a strong base like KOH, it's likely to undergo an elimination reaction. Elimination would form a double bond. With two bromines, maybe two eliminations happen? Or perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH. Each Br is on a different carbon, so dehydrohalogenation could form a double bond between C1 and C3? But wait, the structure of adamantane is a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds, leading to ring opening, but that doesn't seem right because the product is a light yellow solid. Alternatively, it's probably elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, let's think about the structure of adamantane. It's a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The positions 1 and 3 might be on adjacent carbons, so eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between those carbons. So, the product after KOH would be 1,3-didehydroadamantane, which I think is called dehydroadamantane. But wait, isn't adamantane already a polycyclic structure, so forming a double bond within it might lead to a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening elimination. But I'm not sure. Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let's look at the data.

The 1H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone.

Hmm, wait. So the first product has a carbonyl. So perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Let's think: KOH is a strong base, but maybe under certain conditions, it could do an elimination with two HBr molecules, forming a ketone.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane upon treatment with KOH... Could it be a case of a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl group? Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. For example, in vicinal dihalides, treatment with a base can lead to elimination of two molecules of HX to form a double bond. But in this case, maybe it's a dihalide that's not vicinal. Or wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on carbons that are two apart but in a ring structure. Maybe elimination leads to a ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, but the product has a carbonyl. Another possibility is that the KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution. But substitution would require a good leaving group, and Br- is a leaving group. Wait, but the product is a ketone, so maybe the bromides are in positions where elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a case where each Br leaves, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to formation of a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-elimination, where two HBr molecules are eliminated, forming a carbonyl. Let me think: in a vicinal dihalide, two eliminations can form a double bond. But in this case, if the dihalide is 1,3, perhaps it's a bit more spaced out. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading each Br to leave, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a ketone (C=O stretch). So product 1 is a ketone. So, the reaction must have introduced a carbonyl group.

How can 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons, and elimination of HBr twice would form a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the base causes a cleavage. Wait, KOH in a substitution reaction would require a good leaving group, but I'm more familiar with elimination leading to alkenes. However, the product isn't an alkene; it's a ketone.

Wait a minute, maybe the molecule is such that elimination of HBr twice leads to a ring contraction, forming a ketone. For example, if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in a bridge, eliminating HBr from each might cause the bridge to shrink, creating a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination or something else, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a case where the base abstracts a proton, and each Br leaves, forming a double bond, but that doesn't result in a ketone.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the KOH is causing a cleavage of the C-Br bonds. For example, in a dihalide, treatment with a base can lead to cleavage, breaking the carbon-carbon bond and forming two carbonyl groups. Wait, but that would require the two Brs to be on adjacent carbons. If the molecule is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps after cleavage, each carbon would form a carbonyl group. Let me visualize: if the two Brs are on C1 and C3, and the structure is such that the bridge could break between them.

Wait, imagine a structure where C1 and C3 are connected via a bridge. If KOH breaks the C-Br bonds, perhaps the bridge breaks, and each end forms a carbonyl group. So, product 1 would be a diketone? But the IR shows a single peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, but perhaps it's a single ketone group. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a single ketone. Let me think about the structure. If we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, the two Brs are eliminated with two Hs, forming a double bond. But wait, that would form an alkene, not a ketone.

Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, and the two halogens are on adjacent carbons, elimination can occur to form a double bond. But that doesn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal dihalide, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't geminal.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation leading to formation of an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. Hmm, unsure.

Alternatively, perhaps the heating with KOH is causing a cleavage of the adamantane structure, leading to a smaller molecule with a ketone. For example, if the two Brs are on carbons that, when broken, form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is adamantanone, a ketone with the same adamantane structure but with a carbonyl group. So, the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, the Brs are replaced by O- groups, leading to a diketone? Or perhaps one Br is replaced by O- and the other leaves.

Wait, the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The 4.79 ppm is a singlet integrating for 2H. Maybe those are OCH2 groups? Or perhaps they're part of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit with the IR data since an epoxide's carbonyl would be different. Alternatively, the 4.79 could be an -OCH2- group.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 is a strong peak, so likely a ketone. Maybe the product is a ketone where two of the bridgehead Hs are replaced by -O- groups, but that seems a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but that wouldn't have the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl via a base-induced elimination. Let's think: if each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination occurs, perhaps the bridge breaks, and a carbonyl forms. So, the product would be a ketone.

Wait, let's try to imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so if you have two bromines on 1 and 3, perhaps elimination across those leads to a smaller structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination, where two adjacent diols lose water to form a ketone, but that's not the case here because we have dihalide, not diol.

Wait, another approach: think about the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 (2H) could be a singlet, perhaps from a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests several equivalent protons in a certain environment, perhaps in a ring structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone where some of the structure is similar to adamantane but with a CH2O group. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone, but that would require two carbonyl groups, which would show two IR peaks or a different pattern. But the IR shows a single peak at 1720, so perhaps only one ketone group.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me summarize what I know:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane â KOH (excess), 240Â°C â product 1 (light yellow solid, IR 1720 cm-1, NMR as given)
2. Product 1 â heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide â product 2
3. Product 2 â ozonolysis at -78Â°C, workup with dimethylsulfide â product 3
4. What is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3?

Wait, the second step: product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a ketone (from IR), so perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's being used in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But to do Friedel-Crafts, you need an aromatic ring. Does product 1 have an aromatic ring? Probably not, because 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a diamondoid, which is more of a polycyclic structure but not aromatic.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone, and the aluminum isopropoxide is causing some rearrangement. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a diketone. Wait, the IR at 1720 suggests a ketone, maybe a single one. So, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-diketone. Or wait, perhaps it's a gem-diol, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, maybe KOH is causing a nucleophilic substitution, but that would require a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe the base is deprotonating and leading to elimination of two HBr, forming a carbonyl group. So, perhaps each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another, so when both are eliminated, a carbonyl is formed.

Wait, let me think of the structure. If you have two bromines on adjacent carbons in a cyclohexane ring, treating with KOH would eliminate two HBr, forming a double bond. But in this case, the IR shows a carbonyl, not a C=C. So elimination would not form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Or perhaps it's a case of a base-induced cleavage of a dihalide to form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: let me think about the NMR data of product 1.

The NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's upfield for a CH2 group. Maybe it's adjacent to an oxygen. For example, an OCH2 group, but that would typically be around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 that's part of a carbonyl group, like a ketone's CH2. Wait, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is adjacent to CH2 groups.

Wait, product 1's NMR:

- 4.79 (2H): maybe a CH2 next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen.
- 2.41-2.23 (10H): perhaps these are all the equivalent protons in a ring structure, maybe a cyclohexane ring with substituents.
- 1.94 (2H): maybe another CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to the carbonyl.

Putting this together, maybe product 1 is a structure where two CH2 groups are adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a structure like (CH2)2CO, but in a larger ring.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexanone derivative. But then the NMR might show a peak around 2.1 ppm for the ketone-adjacent CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a bridged ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone via a cleavage of the adamantane structure. For example, if KOH causes the two Brs to leave, and the resulting structure forms a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic ketone, like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Well, maybe I'm getting stuck on the first step. Let me consider the entire problem again, perhaps focusing on the last step.

The last step is ozonolysis of product 2, which gives product 3. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond. Because ozonolysis is done at -78Â°C, which is a common condition for reductive workup or to prevent side reactions.

Wait, but product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide. So, product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is perhaps an alkene.

Hmm, if product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an alkene, how does that happen? Maybe product 1 undergoes a reduction to form an alcohol, which then eliminates to form an alkene. But wait, aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, not a reducing agent. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but I don't see the aromatic ring.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps product 1 is a ketone that undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. But that would require the presence of a leaving group or some acidic hydrogen. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ketone, which upon heating can open to form a diene.

Wait, not sure. Let me think again: product 1 has a carbonyl, and product 2 is formed by heating with Al(i-Pr)3. Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone that, upon treatment with a Lewis acid, undergoes a ring-opening or rearrangement to form an alkene.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a bicyclic ketone. Heating with a Lewis acid could cause it to open into a more strained structure, leading to an alkene. For example, a norbornene-like structure which upon ring-opening forms a diene or an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic compound, and upon treatment with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a rearrangement to form an exocyclic double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone that, when heated with a Lewis acid, undergoes an elimination to form an alkene. So, product 2 would be an alkene.

But for elimination, we need a Î²-hydrogen. So, product 1 (the ketone) must have a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl group. But ketones typically don't have adjacent hydrogens unless it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, say, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one. Then, heating with a Lewis acid could cause a ring-opening elimination, forming an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a bridgehead ketone, and the Lewis acid catalyzes a bridgehead elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, bridgehead elimination is possible in certain bicyclic structures. For example, norbornene derivatives can undergo elimination to form alkenes. So, perhaps product 1 is a bridged bicyclic ketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed via elimination.

If product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups. So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Ozonolysis of an alkene usually cleaves it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if the alkene was between carbons A and B, then ozonolysis would break into A=O and B=O, assuming the structure allows.

Wait, but the exact structure of product 2's alkene will determine the structure of product 3.

Let me try to reconstruct the possible structures.

Assuming that product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis of product 2 gives product 3.

So, perhaps product 3 is a diketone or a dialdehyde, depending on the structure of the alkene.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded proton is typically one that's in an environment with the least electron density, such as being adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, in product 3 after ozonolysis, the structure would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So, if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, the ozonolysis would form two carbonyls, perhaps ketones or aldehydes.

But I'm trying to imagine the structure of product 2's alkene. Let's say product 2 is a simple alkene, like CH2=CH-. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups, but that's a simple case.

But in a more complex structure, let's say product 2 is a bridged bicyclic alkene. For example, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to carbonyl groups.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a simple alkene, like 2-pentene, but that's only a guess.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone that upon treatment with Al(i-Pr)3 forms a new structure, perhaps an enol ether or something else.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded hydrogen would have the highest ppm value. In the NMR, the coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens.

Assuming product 3 is a diketone, the hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. Let's say the structure has a CH2 group next to two carbonyls. Then, each proton on CH2 would couple with the neighboring protons.

Wait, for example, if the structure is (CH2)2(C=O), then the CH2 protons would each be adjacent to two others. But if it's a geminal coupling, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the hydrogen is next to two different sets of hydrogens.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 has a structure where a CH is adjacent to two different CH groups, leading to a triplet of triplets or another coupling pattern.

Wait, let's think of the possible splitting. The most deshielded hydrogen is probably in a position where it's next to two different sets of neighboring hydrogens. For example, if it's a CH group adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each of which has two protons, then the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is adjacent to two other sets of protons, each with a different coupling constant, the splitting could result in a triplet of triplets or another pattern.

Wait, the question gives options: triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, pentet.

So, the possible coupling patterns are various, but I need to figure out the structure to determine which one it is.

Wait, let me try to outline the entire reaction pathway again.

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH â product 1 (carbonyl group, so likely a ketone)
   - Structure of product 1: perhaps a bridged bicyclic ketone, like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one.

2. Product 1 + Al(i-Pr)3 â product 2 (an alkene)
   - Mechanism: perhaps elimination of the ketone to form an alkene via a ring-opening or rearrangement.

3. Product 2 (alkene) undergoes ozonolysis â product 3 (carbonyl compounds)
   - The structure of product 3 would depend on where the double bond was. Let's assume product 2 has a bridgehead double bond.

Wait, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, then ozonolysis would cleave the bridge, leading to a diketone or dialdehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a norbornene derivative, and ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

For example, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) upon ozonolysis would give two ketones. Because norbornene's double bond is within a bridge, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. The resulting structure would have two ketone groups.

Wait, but let me think about the ozonolysis of norbornene. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with a bridgehead double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond and form two carbonyl groups, resulting in a structure with two ketones.

So, product 3 would be a diketone, perhaps bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dione.

Wait, in that structure, the two ketone groups are adjacent. The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one next to both ketones, perhaps in a CH group.

So, the structure would have a CH group between two carbonyls. Let me draw this:

O=C-CH2-CO-O (but that's not right). Wait, more accurately, the structure would be:

O=C-(bridge)-C(=O)-

Wait, perhaps it's a five-membered ring with two adjacent ketones. The protons adjacent to the two ketone groups would be in a particular environment.

Wait, no, norbornene has two rings. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups, leading to a structure with two ketones in a bridge.

But perhaps the structure is such that the two carbonyls are on adjacent carbons, and the remaining structure is a bridge.

In this case, the hydrogen(s) adjacent to both carbonyls would be highly deshielded. Let's consider a CH group between two ketones.

The CH would have two neighboring groups, each with their own set of protons. For instance, the CH group might be adjacent to two different CH2 groups.

Wait, but if the structure is such that the CH is next to two different sets of protons, each with a different splitting, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is adjacent to two sets of two protons each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, if the CH is next to two CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each H on the CH would split into a triplet from each adjacent CH2. So, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it could be a pentet.

Wait, but wait. Let's model this.

Suppose the structure is:

O=C-R-CH2-CH2-C=O

No, that's not right. Let me think again. Ozonolysis of a bridged bicyclic alkene would form two carbonyl groups in a bridge.

Wait, the actual product might be something like:

O=C-(bridge)-CH2-C(=O)-

No, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO?

But that doesn't make sense in a bridged system.

Alternatively, the product could be a cyclopropane ring with two ketone groups attached. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a tricyclic compound with two ketones.

Wait, perhaps the ozonolysis of product 2 (alkene) leads to a structure where a CH is flanked by two carbonyl groups, each of which has two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure, but perhaps I can proceed with general knowledge.

In the ozonolysis product, the most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to two carbonyl groups. If that hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to two carbonyls, each of its protons would couple with neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is in a CH group adjacent to two other CH groups, each with two protons, then each H on the CH would couple with two sets of two Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, for example, if a CH group is adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each H on the CH would split into a triplet from each adjacent CH2. So, the splitting would be triplet of triplet, making a total of 3Ã3=9 peaks, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, the coupling constants might be similar, making it a pentet (n+1, where n=4, but that seems unlikely).

Wait, perhaps the hydrogen is adjacent to three different sets of protons. For example, if the CH group is next to two CH2 groups and another CH, then the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two different CH groups. Then, each H on CH2 would split into a triplet from each adjacent CH, possibly leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure, but looking at the options:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

If the most deshielded H is adjacent to two different sets of two protons each, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets (option B). Alternatively, if it's adjacent to two different J values, it could be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: in a CH group adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two protons, each H on the CH would see two neighboring sets of two Hs. So, each H would split into a triplet from each CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But that's a possible scenario. Alternatively, if the CH is adjacent to two CH groups, each with two Hs, then each H would split into a triplet, leading again to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, the coupling is determined by the number of neighboring Hs. So, if a hydrogen has two adjacent Hs on one side and two on the other, but the coupling constants are different, it would result in a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the coupling constants are the same, it could be a pentet (n=4, so 5 peaks).

But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: in product 3, the most deshielded H is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Let's say it's a CH2 group between two carbonyls. Each CH2 H would couple with the adjacent Hs.

Wait, for example:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO

In this case, the central CH2 group would have two adjacent CH2 groups. Each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would split into a quartet (n=3 from one side, n=3 from the other?), no, wait.

Wait, no, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on the neighboring CH2.

Wait, but the coupling is only with neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons. So, for the central CH2, each H is next to the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 groups.

So, each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other. So, each H would have (2+1) Ã (2+1) = 9 peaks, but that's a triplet of triplets. But that doesn't seem right because each H on CH2 is only coupled with the adjacent CH2's Hs.

Wait, perhaps the coupling is only between adjacent CH2 groups. So, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups. Each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs from each adjacent CH2. So, each H would have 2+1 = 3 splits from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is in a position where it's adjacent to two different CH groups, each with two Hs.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the most deshielded H is part of a CH group next to two other CH groups, each with two Hs. So, each H on the central CH would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of triplets if the coupling constants are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between a CH2 group and a CH group, leading to a different pattern.

Hmm, it's a bit challenging, but perhaps the correct answer is a triplet of triplets, option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with excess KOH at 240Â°C, forming product 1.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, specifically a ketone.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41â2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a ketone group and specific proton environments, likely a bicyclic ketone such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one.

2. **Reaction with Al(i-Pr)â**:  
   - Product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, forming product 2.  
   - This step likely involves a rearrangement or elimination, resulting in an alkene. A plausible structure for product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, a bridged bicyclic alkene.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   - Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78Â°C, followed by workup with dimethylsulfide, forming product 3.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, breaking it into two carbonyl groups. A likely structure for product 3 is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dione, a diketone with two adjacent ketone groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen in Product 3**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to both ketone groups. This hydrogen is part of a CH group flanked by two carbonyls.  
   - This hydrogen couples with neighboring hydrogens from adjacent groups. Specifically, it is adjacent to two CHâ groups, each with two protons.  
   - Each hydrogen on the CH group splits into a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on one CHâ group. Since there are two such CHâ groups, the splitting pattern becomes a **triplet of triplets**.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet of triplets**.
