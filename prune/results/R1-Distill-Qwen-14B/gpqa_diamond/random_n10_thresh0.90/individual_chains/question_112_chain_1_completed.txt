Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's asking.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I probably need to normalize this state because it's only given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. 

Then, the question is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. This operator has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, wait, so if i≠j, Aij = ħ/2, else zero. That would mean the matrix is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0  ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if it's a 2x2 matrix, then for i and j each being 1 and 2 (assuming up and down are the basis), then A11=0, A12=ħ/2, A21=ħ/2, A22=0. So it's a 2x2 matrix with off-diagonal elements ħ/2 and diagonal zero.

Wait, but what operator has this matrix? That looks familiar. Oh, wait, the Pauli X operator is [[0 1],[1 0]], but here the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So maybe this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices usually have 1s in the off-diagonal, but here it's scaled by ħ/2. So, this operator is probably (ħ/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x, right? Because the scaling doesn't affect the eigenvectors, just the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so for this operator A, the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. So, the measurement outcomes correspond to the eigenvalues, but the probabilities are based on the projection of |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

So, first step: normalize |alpha>. Then, express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Then, the probabilities are the squares of the amplitudes.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as σ_x's. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2, right? Because σ_x flips the spin states.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/√2 and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/√2. So, any state can be written as a combination of these, and the coefficients will give the probabilities.

But perhaps I should proceed methodically.

First, normalize |alpha>. Let me write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So, compute the inner product:

(1-i) (1+i) + (2+i)(2 - i) = ?

Wait, wait. Let me compute each part. The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) for the |up> component, and (2-i)(2+i) for the |down> component, because when you take the inner product, you take the conjugate of the first component and multiply.

So, for |up><up|: (1+i) * (1-i) = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2? Wait, no, wait: (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b². So, (1+i)(1-i)= 1^2 +1^2 = 2.

For |down><down|: (2 - i)(2 + i) = (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because |alpha> is proportional to the given vector, so |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->.

So, |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+> + c_- |->.

Substituting |+> and |->:

c_+ = < + | alpha >, and c_- = < - | alpha >.

So, compute c_+:

c_+ = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Multiply it out:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i +2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [3 ] / sqrt(7)
= 3 / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7))
= 3 / sqrt(14)

Similarly, compute c_-:

c_- = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - <down| ) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Multiply:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [1 + i -2 + i ] / sqrt(7)
= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(7)
= ( (-1 + 2i) ) / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

Wait, but we can compute the amplitudes squared to get probabilities. The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

(3^2) / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Which is approximately 0.64, which matches option A's first value.

Wait, let me compute |c_-|^2:

Numerator is (-1 + 2i)(-1 - 2i) = (1) + (2i)(-2i) → 1 + 4 =5.

So denominator is 14, so 5/14 ≈ 0.357. Wait, but wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36, which is the second number in option A.

Wait, but wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, yes, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

But wait, 9 +5 is 14, so that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14 ≈ 0.36.

Now, the average value of the operator A.

The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, because A is Hermitian (since it's a matrix with real entries, actually, wait, the matrix elements are hbar/2 for i≠j, and zero otherwise. So A is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Which is symmetric, so Hermitian. So, its eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute <A> using the expansion in the eigenstates of A.

Because if |alpha> is expressed as c_+ |+> + c_- |->, then <A> is c_+ c_+^* λ_+ + c_- c_-^* λ_-, where λ_+ and λ_- are the eigenvalues.

Wait, no, because |+> and |-> are the eigenstates, so when you measure A, you get λ_+ with probability |c_+|² and λ_- with |c_-|².

But the average value <A> is sum (prob * eigenvalue) ) = |c_+|² λ_+ + |c_-|² λ_-.

Wait, because |alpha> is a sum of |+> and |->, each multiplied by their coefficients.

So, what are λ_+ and λ_-? Earlier, I thought A is (ħ/2) σ_x, so the eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but let me make sure.

The operator A is given by the matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λ I) = 0.

So,

| -λ    ħ/2     |
| ħ/2   -λ     |  = 0

Which is λ² - ( (ħ/2)^2 ) = 0 → λ² = (ħ²/4) → λ = ± ħ/2.

So yes, the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So, the average value is (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9 -5) * ħ ] / (2*14) ) = (4 ħ) / (28) ) = ħ/7.

Which is hbar /7, matching option A's third value.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is ħ/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron state |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The goal is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of an operator with matrix representation A, where Aij = ħ/2 for i ≠ j and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |alpha>
The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, compute the inner product:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of A are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\text{up}\rangle + |\text{down}\rangle), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\text{up}\rangle - |\text{down}\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |-> 
To find the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \), compute the projections:

\[
c_+ = \langle + | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle - | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates |+> and |-> are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+): |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-): |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The average value of A is given by:

\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+)\lambda_+ + P(-)\lambda_-,
\]

where \( \lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( \lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \). Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4\hbar}{28} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
