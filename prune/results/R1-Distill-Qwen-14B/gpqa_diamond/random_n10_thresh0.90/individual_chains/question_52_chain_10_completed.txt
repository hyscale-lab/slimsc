Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, their overall temperature changes, which affects the ionization states of elements in their photosphere.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the presence of spots lowers the star's effective temperature.

The question focuses on the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They've observed this ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, so when there are spots, the ratio is lower. But the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So I think we're looking for (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots), which is the factor by which it increases.

In the stellar photosphere, under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) is proportional to exp(-h c / λ k T), where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is wavelength, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two levels decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the Teff is higher (6000 K), and when spots are present, Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2, or n2/n1? Because the ratio depends on which level is higher in energy. Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when the spots are present, perhaps it's the ratio of lower energy level to higher. Because when T decreases, the ratio would decrease if the higher energy level is less populated. Wait, let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2, n1/n2. In the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 decreases as T decreases. Because the exponential term is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so lower T makes the exponential smaller, so n2/n1 decreases. So if the ratio n1/n2 is 1/(n2/n1), then when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that would suggest that the ratio being discussed is n2/n1. Because when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases, which matches the observation.

Wait, the problem says when the spots are present, the ratio decreases. So let's model this.

Let me define R = n1/n2. Without spots, R0. With spots, R1. The question asks for R0/R1.

From Boltzmann: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Because E2 > E1, the exponent is positive. So, when T increases, exp term increases, making R = n1/n2 larger. But wait, when T increases, the ratio R goes up because the denominator (n2) is lower. Hmm, not sure. Let me write it more carefully.

The Boltzmann distribution says:

n2 = n1 * (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So, R = n1/n2 = [1 / (g2/g1)] * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, R is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) multiplied by (g1/g2).

Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are constants in this scenario (same for all Ti atoms), then R is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So, if the temperature decreases, ΔE/(k T) becomes larger (since T is smaller), so the exponent becomes larger, so R increases.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So R would increase when spots are present. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the ratio being considered is n2/n1 instead. Let's see: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. So if the observed ratio (n2/n1) is decreasing when T decreases, then that's what's happening. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, in this case, the observed ratio is n2/n1, and it's getting lower when spots are present.

But the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So that's (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_with_spots.

So R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So, the factor is [exp( -ΔE/(k T0))]/[exp( -ΔE/(k T1)) ] where T0 is 6000 K (no spots) and T1 is 5500 K (with spots).

Wait, but wait. Because when there are spots, the effective temperature is lower, but the photosphere (the unspotted regions) is at a higher temperature. Oh wait, no. Wait, the problem says when spots are present, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the entire photosphere isn't at 5500 K; the spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. Oh, wait, no: the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K.

Wait, but actually, the effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation. The presence of cooler spots would make the overall effective temperature lower. So the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

But when considering the ionization and excitation in the photosphere, each region (spotted or not) has its own temperature. Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Or perhaps the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest is at 6000 K.

Wait, the problem says when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the star has a mix of regions: 60% at 6000 K and 40% at a lower temperature (spots). But the problem gives the photospheric effective temperature as 5500 K when spots are present, so that's the average.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, in LTE, each region of the photosphere (unspotted and spotted) has its own temperature. The overall ratio would be a mix of the two regions.

But the problem says to assume the stellar photosphere is in LTE. Hmm, maybe the entire photosphere is at the same temperature? Or perhaps the effective temperature is a global measure, but the actual temperature structure is different. Wait, the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, its Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K.

So I think when spots are present, the average flux is lower, so the effective temperature is lower, but the photospheric temperature is not uniform. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the photosphere is at an average temperature of 5500 K when spots are present, and 6000 K when not.

Wait, but the problem says, the photospheric effective temperature. So it's the effective temperature of the photosphere as a whole. So when spots are present, the photosphere's overall Teff is 5500 K.

So, in this case, when calculating the ratio of the population of Ti atoms, which is in LTE, each point in the photosphere is at a certain temperature. But the observed spectrum is an average over all regions.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the photosphere's average is 5500 K, but the individual regions (unspotted and spotted) are at different temperatures.

Alternatively, maybe the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. But perhaps in the problem, when the star has spots, the photosphere is at 5500 K, and when it doesn't, it's at 6000 K. So for the purposes of this problem, the effective temperature is the temperature that determines the excitation and ionization.

Wait, but the problem says that "the stellar photosphere is in LTE." Hmm. So perhaps the photosphere is at a uniform temperature, regardless of spots? But that doesn't make sense because spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things, treating the photosphere as being at the effective temperature. So when the star has spots, the Teff is 5500 K, so the photosphere is at 5500 K. When it doesn't, it's at 6000 K. So each scenario has a uniform temperature.

But that might not be entirely accurate, because the presence of spots would affect the overall emission, but the individual regions would have their own temperatures. However, for this problem, maybe we're to take the effective temperature as the photospheric temperature.

So, assuming that, when the star has no spots, the photosphere is at 6000 K, and when it has spots, it's at 5500 K.

So the ratio R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, the factor is R0/R1 = [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T0) ) ] / [ exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T0 - 1/T1) ) ]

Wait, no: because R0 is for T0=6000, R1 for T1=5500.

So factor = R0/R1 = [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T0) ) ] / [exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) ) ]

Which is exp[ (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T0) - 1/(T1)) ) ]

Wait, that's correct because when you divide exponents with same base, you subtract exponents.

So, E2-E1 = h c / λ, because the transition corresponds to a wavelength λ. Wait, the transition is between the two levels, and the energy difference is given by hc/λ. So E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

So, substituting E2-E1 = hc/(λ), then the exponent becomes (hc/λ) * (1/(k T0) - 1/(k T1) )

Which is (hc)/(λ k) [ (1/T0 - 1/T1) ]

Wait, the hc/(λk) term can be written as (h c)/(λ k) = (h c) / (λ k )

But let's compute this:

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So compute hc/(λ k):

Compute numerator: h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J m

Denominator: λ k = (1.448e-7 m) * (1.38e-23 J/K) = 1.448e-7 *1.38e-23 = approx 2.00e-30 J m/K

So hc/(λ k) = (1.9878e-25) / (2.00e-30) ) = approx (1.9878 / 2) * 1e5 = ~0.9939e5 ≈ 9.94e4 K

Wait, because 1e-25 / 1e-30 is 1e5. So approximately 9.94e4 K.

Wait, but wait: Let me compute this more accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J s (exact value, since it's defined)
c=2.99792458e8 m/s (exact)
λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = approximately 1.98644586e-25 J m.

λ k = (1.448e-7 m) * (1.380649e-23 J/K) = 1.448 * 1.380649e-30 = approx 2.000e-30 J m/K.

So hc/(λ k) = 1.98644586e-25 / 2.000e-30 = (1.98644586 / 2) * 1e5 = 0.99322293e5 ≈ 99322.293 K.

So approximately 99,322 K.

So the exponent is (99322 K) * (1/(6000) - 1/(5500)).

Compute 1/6000 = 0.0001666667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818182.

Difference: 0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182 = -0.0000151515.

Multiply by 99322 K: 99322 * (-0.0000151515) ≈ let's compute:

99322 * 0.000015 = approx 1.48983.

But since it's 0.0000151515, about 1.51515e-5.

So 99322 * 1.51515e-5 = 99322 * 0.0000151515 ≈ approximately 1.506.

Wait, perhaps a better way:

Compute (1/(6000) - 1/(5500)) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 *5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -500 / 33e6 = -1/66,000 ≈ -1.51515e-5.

So (hc/λk) * (1/T0 - 1/T1) = 99322 * ( -1.51515e-5 ) = approx -1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506.

So the factor is exp( -1.506 ) ≈ e^(-1.506) ≈ approx 0.221.

Wait, but wait, the factor is R0/R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) [1/T0 -1/T1] )

Which is exp( (hc/(λ k)) [1/(T0) -1/(T1)] )

Wait, I think I might have messed up the sign. Let me recheck.

Because the exponent in R is (E2-E1)/(k T), so R0/R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T0) - (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T0 - 1/T1) )

Which is positive because E2-E1 is positive, and 1/T0 < 1/T1 (since T0=6000 > T1=5500). So (1/T0 -1/T1) is negative, so the exponent is negative.

So exp( -1.506 ) is about 0.221.

Wait, but that would mean R0/R1 = 0.221. So the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. But the question states that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So R0 is less than R1? Or wait, wait, no. R = n1/n2.

If the ratio decreases when spots are present, R1 < R0. So R0/R1 is greater than 1. But in our calculation, we got 0.221, which would imply R0 is less than R1, which contradicts the observation.

Hm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in defining R.

Wait, let's re-express the ratio.

R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, R increases because (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponential term increases.

So when T is higher (6000 K), R is higher. When T decreases (5500 K), R decreases.

In this problem, when the star has spots, R decreases. So R0 is higher than R1. So R0/R1 is greater than 1.

But according to our calculation, the factor is exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.221, which is less than 1. That suggests R0 is less than R1, which contradicts the scenario.

Hmm, perhaps I mixed up the levels. Because if level 2 is the higher energy level, and we're considering n1/n2, then when temperature increases, the ratio increases. So without spots, R0 is higher than R1 with spots.

But according to our calculation, R0/R1 is 0.221, which is about 1/4.5. So that's a factor of about 4.5 if we take R1/R0.

Wait, so if R0 is n1/n2 at 6000 K, and R1 is n1/n2 at 5500 K, then R0 is larger than R1 because T is higher. So R0/R1 is greater than 1. But our calculation gave 0.221, which is less than 1. So I must have mixed up the terms.

Wait, let's re-express the calculation.

The exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T0 - 1/T1 )

Which is (hc/λk) (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

But 1/6000 is less than 1/5500, so 1/T0 -1/T1 is negative. So the exponent is negative.

So R0/R1 = exp( negative ), which is less than 1. So R0 < R1. But the problem says that R decreases when spots are present, which would mean R1 < R0. So this is a contradiction.

So perhaps the ratio being considered is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2.

Because if R is n2/n1, then R = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

In this case, with higher T, R is higher.

Wait, when T increases, -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative, so exp becomes smaller. So R = n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( ... )

Wait, no. For R = n2/n1, when T increases, the denominator (k T) in the exponent increases, so the exponent -(E2-E1)/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp increases.

So when T increases, R increases.

So, when there are no spots, T is higher (6000 K), so R0 = n2/n1 at 6000 K is higher than R1 = n2/n1 at 5500 K.

So R0/R1 would be greater than 1.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So R0 > R1, so R0/R1 is (say) 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but in our calculation, for R = n1/n2, R0/R1 is 0.221. So if the ratio being considered is n2/n1, then the factor R0/R1 would be 1/0.221 ≈4.529, which rounds to ~4.5. That's option C.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

So the answer is C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the statistical weights, \(E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Without spots**: \(T_0 = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **With spots**: \(T_1 = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The energy difference between the levels corresponds to the wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), so \(E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(c\) is the speed of light.

### Calculation:
The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_0}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_1} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \(E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), we get:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp\left(\frac{hc}{\lambda k} \left(\frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

#### Step 1: Compute \(\frac{hc}{\lambda k}\)
Using constants:
- \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s}\),
- \(c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\),
- \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\),
- \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\),

\[
\frac{hc}{\lambda k} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{(1.448 \times 10^{-7})(1.38 \times 10^{-23})}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:
\[
hc = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J m}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
\lambda k = (1.448 \times 10^{-7})(1.38 \times 10^{-23}) = 2.00 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{J m/K}.
\]

Now divide:
\[
\frac{hc}{\lambda k} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{2.00 \times 10^{-30}} = 9.94 \times 10^4 \, \text{K}.
\]

#### Step 2: Compute \(\frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{1}{T_1}\)
\[
\frac{1}{T_0} = \frac{1}{6000} = 0.00016667, \quad \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.00018182.
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{1}{T_1} = 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515.
\]

#### Step 3: Compute the exponent
\[
\text{Exponent} = \frac{hc}{\lambda k} \left(\frac{1}{T_0} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = (9.94 \times 10^4)(-0.00001515) \approx -1.506.
\]

#### Step 4: Compute the factor
\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.506) \approx 0.221.
\]

### Interpretation:
The factor \(0.221\) implies that the ratio \(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\) is smaller when the star has spots compared to when it does not. However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present, which aligns with this result. To find the factor by which the ratio changes, we take the reciprocal:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_0}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_1} = \frac{1}{0.221} \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio increases by a factor of approximately **4.5** when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

### Final Answer:
**C) ~4.5**
