Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is about 277 K, which is close to 277-273=4°C, so that's just above freezing. Hmm, melting point around 4°C... I think that's similar to ice, but wait, ice's melting point is 273 K (0°C). Maybe B is something else... Let me think.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is a solid at room temperature but melts just above 273 K. Or perhaps it's a different substance. Let me keep that in mind.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So, what's a common reagent in organic reactions that's involved in such reactions?

Thinking about common reagents, maybe something like a strong base or oxidizing agent. Wait, sodium metal reacts violently with water, releasing hydrogen gas. That rings a bell because sodium is a metal that reacts exothermically with water, producing H2 gas, NaOH, and sodium hydroxide as the precipitate. But wait, sodium hydroxide is soluble, so maybe it's another product. Alternatively, perhaps it's a metal reacting with an acid.

Wait, but the precipitate G when heated releases B. If G is something like a hydroxide that, when heated, loses water and forms an oxide? For example, maybe G is a metal hydroxide, and upon heating, it becomes a metal oxide (B) and water. But then, B's melting point is around 277 K. Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking back, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For instance, hydrogen gas (H2) has 1 proton each, but no neutrons. So that won't fit. Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's He-4), so He has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So, W could be He, but that's a noble gas, so maybe not reacting in such a way.

Wait, another possibility: NH3? No, because its molecular formula is different. Wait, let me think of isotopes. If the gas is something like D2O? No, because that's heavy water. Wait, maybe the gas is H2O? But H2O has 2 protons and (depending on the isotope) varying neutrons. Wait, for H2O, each H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons. O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope. So the molecule would have 2 protons from H and 8 from O, total 10. Neutrons would be 0 (from H) +8 (from O) =8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons—doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. How about C? No, carbon as a gas would be CO2 or something else. Wait, maybe carbon monoxide (CO)? No, that has 6 protons and 6+8=14 neutrons? Not matching.

Wait, another approach: the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule must be equal. Let's think of a molecule where the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons.

Wait, water is H2O: sum of protons is 2*1 +8=10. Sum of neutrons is 0 (from H) +8 (from O)=8. Not equal.

What about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) +4 (H) =10. Neutrons: C is 6 neutrons, H 0: sum is 6. Not equal.

Ammonia (NH3): 14 protons (1 for N, 3 for H?) Wait, N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So NH3 has 7 + 3 =10 protons. Neutrons: N-14 has 7 neutrons, H has 0. Sum is 7. Protons 10, neutrons 7. Not equal.

Wait, maybe it's something else. What about CO2? Protons: C=6, O=8 *2=16. Total 22. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So sum is 6 + 16 =22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Wait, that's equal. So the gas W could be CO2? But wait, when a metal reacts with water, the gas is H2, right? So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the gas is CH4? No, because the sum of protons would be 10, neutrons 6 (if C is 12). Doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the gas is something like O2. Let's see: O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons (assuming O-16). So each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. Two atoms: 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the sum is 32. Oh, that's equal. So W could be O2.

Wait, but when a metal like Na reacts with water, the gas is H2, not O2. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe W is another gas. Wait, another possibility: maybe the gas is a noble gas. For example, Xe has atomic number 54, so each atom has 54 protons and 54-54=0 (if it's stable, but wait, Xe's atomic number is 54. So a molecule of Xe would have 54 protons and 54-54=0? No, that's not right. Wait, the number of neutrons is mass number minus protons. So, if Xe is in a certain isotope, say Xe-132: protons 54, neutrons 132-54=78. So the sum of protons is 54, sum of neutrons is 78—so not equal.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about what the reaction could be.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y. Liquid Y could be water, maybe. So X is a metal, perhaps sodium, which reacts vigorously with water to produce hydrogen gas. Wait, but earlier I thought the gas would be H2. Let's think: if X is sodium, Y is water (H2O), then the reaction would be 2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑. So the gas W is H2.

But H2 has 2 atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So the molecule (H2) has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So protons (2) vs. neutrons (0) – not equal. So that doesn't match the condition for gas W.

Wait, but the question says the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So H2 doesn't fit. Hmm. So maybe Y isn't water. Or maybe X isn't sodium.

Another possibility: Y is maybe an acid, like H2SO4. Then X could be a metal, but the reaction would produce a different gas. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else.

Wait, what if Y is a liquid like bromine (Br2). Then maybe X is an alkali metal, like K, which reacts violently with Br2 to produce KBr and a lot of heat. But then the gas would be perhaps Br vapor, but Br2 is a liquid itself. Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another thought: what if Y is something else, like ethanol or another organic liquid? But I'm not sure about the reaction products in that case.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, Mg reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat. So the gas W would be H2 again, which as before doesn't fit. So that doesn't satisfy the condition that W has equal protons and neutrons in its molecule.

Wait, another angle: maybe the gas is something like NH3, but I don't know the reaction that would produce that. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a heavier isotope, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? Because earlier that fit the condition. So when would a reaction produce CO2 as a gas? Typically when a carbonate reacts with an acid, or when a hydrocarbon is burned. But the reaction in the question is with a liquid Y. Hmm.

Wait, let's try to think of the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, G is formed. When G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4°C. So B is a solid at room temperature, but melts just above 0°C. Wait, that's almost like water's melting point, but a bit higher. So what solid melts around 4°C? Maybe something like a hydrate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: maybe B is a metal oxide. For example, if X is sodium, and Y is water, then the precipitate is sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is actually soluble, so that's not a precipitate. Hmm, so maybe Y isn't water.

Wait, perhaps X is a heavy metal, and Y is something that forms a precipitate. Let me think about other metals. For example, if X is lead, and Y is nitric acid, then maybe the reaction produces a lead nitrate solution, but I'm not sure about the precipitate part.

Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid. For example, if X is FeS, and Y is HCl, then the reaction would produce FeCl2, H2S gas, and maybe a precipitate. But I'm not sure. Let's think through.

Wait, another approach: the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group, like something like acetoacetic acid. When it reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent, or a base.

Wait, for example, if X is a strong base like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid. The reaction would be neutralization: acetic acid + NaOH → sodium acetate + water. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COONa, which has oxygen in the acetate group, but I'm not sure about the product's oxygen count. The product would have acetate (COO-) which has two oxygens from the acid, but I'm not sure if that's what the question is referring to.

Alternatively, maybe when the keto acid reacts with X, it forms something with two oxygen atoms, like maybe a diethyl ether or something else, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a metal, and the reaction with the keto acid forms a salt. For example, if the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (O=C(OH)-OH?), and X is a metal like Mg, the reaction would form a magnesium salt, perhaps with oxygen in the structure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the keto acid reacts with X to form a metal carboxylate, which would have oxygen in the structure. For example, if the keto acid is propanoic acid (CH3CH2COOH), and X is Na, the product would be Na+ and CH3CH2COO^- Na^+.

But the product's molecule has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is something like a carbonate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ester, but that's not formed by a simple reaction between a metal and a keto acid.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to summarize the information again.

1. X reacts with Y (liquid) violently, releasing gas W (equal protons and neutrons in molecule) and precipitate G.

2. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point around 277 K (~4°C).

3. Product of X with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms.

4. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry; its analog is a close substance.

Hmm, perhaps X is a metal like lithium, sodium, potassium, etc., but let's think about their reactions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the precipitate G is a hydroxide, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and water. For example, if G is Mg(OH)2, heating it would give MgO and H2O. MgO has a melting point of about 2800°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate. If X is a metal, and Y is a carbonate acid, then the reaction could produce a metal carbonate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe G is a sulfide. When heated, it might decompose. For example, CuS might decompose into Cu and S, but I'm not certain about the melting points.

Wait, another angle: the melting point of B is close to 277 K (4°C). What solid has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate, but I'm not sure. Wait, ammonium nitrate's melting point is around 169°C. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: what about ice? Ice melts at 273 K (0°C). So 277 K is 4°C, which is just above that. So maybe B is a solid that's just starting to melt, but that's not ice. Alternatively, maybe B is a different form of water, like ice, but that's just a guess.

Wait, another approach: maybe B is a metal that has a low melting point. Let's think of metals with low melting points. For example, mercury melts around -39°C, which is way below 277 K. Lead melts at 327°C, which is way higher. Maybe tin? Tin's melting point is around 232°C. Hmm, no.

Wait, maybe B is something else. Let's think of a solid that's solid at room temperature and melts just above 0°C. One possibility is a hydrate. For example, maybe G is a hydrate that, when heated, releases water and leaves B. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe B is something like a carbonate that decomposes upon heating.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a carbonate. For example, Mg reacting with CO2 to form MgO and C. But I'm not sure about the details.

Wait, maybe the precipitate G is a hydroxide that, upon heating, loses water to form an oxide. For example, if G is Fe(OH)3, heating it would give Fe2O3 and water. But Fe2O3 has a high melting point, so that might not fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on the B part. Let's try to think of another angle.

The product of the reaction with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a metal that, when reacting with the keto acid, forms a di-oxygenated product. For example, maybe the keto acid is something like formic acid (HCOOH), and X is sodium. The reaction would form sodium formate (HCOO^- Na^+), which has two oxygen atoms in the formate ion. So the product has 2 oxygen atoms. That could fit.

So, if X is Na, which is a common reagent in organic chemistry, especially in the Birch reduction or other reactions. So maybe X is sodium.

Wait, if X is sodium, then when it reacts with Y (maybe an acid), the reaction would produce H2 gas, but earlier I thought that doesn't fit because H2's protons and neutrons don't match. Oh, but wait, maybe Y is a heavy isotope of an acid, like H18O2 or something. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a heavy water, like D2O. Then the reaction between Na and D2O would produce D2 gas. Let's see: D2 has 2 deuterium atoms. Each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So molecule D2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the sum of protons is 2, sum of neutrons is 2. That makes them equal. Oh! So that fits the condition that W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons.

So W would be D2, a heavy hydrogen gas.

So, putting this together:

X is sodium (Na), Y is D2O (heavy water), the reaction is:

2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + H2 (or D2? Wait, in reality, Na reacts with D2O to produce NaOD and H2 gas? Or maybe D2?) Hmm, wait, when sodium reacts with heavy water, it typically produces D2 gas. Because the reaction is:

2 Na + 2 H2O → 2 NaOH + H2↑

But with D2O, it would be:

2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + D2↑

So, the gas W is D2, which has 2 protons (each D is 1 proton) and 2 neutrons (each D is 1 neutron). So sum of protons is 2, sum of neutrons is 2. So they are equal. That fits the condition.

So, the precipitate G would be NaOD. Wait, but sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is soluble, but sodium deuterium oxide (NaOD) is also soluble. So why is G a precipitate? Hmm, perhaps Y isn't D2O but another liquid. Maybe Y is something else. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is something else, like a metal hydroxide that's insoluble.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is not D2O but another liquid, like a solution of a salt. For example, if Y is a nitrate solution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the reaction I described earlier, the product would be NaOD and D2 gas. If NaOD is soluble, then G wouldn't precipitate. So perhaps Y is a solution that forms an insoluble hydroxide. Alternatively, perhaps X is a different metal, like lead or something else that forms an insoluble hydroxide.

Wait, let's think again. If X is lead (Pb), and Y is an acid like H2SO4, the reaction could produce PbSO4, which is a precipitate. But then the gas would be SO2 or something else, which doesn't fit the W condition.

Hmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Let's go back to the product of the reaction with the keto acid. If X is sodium, and the product has 2 oxygen atoms, perhaps it's a formate or another salt with two oxygen atoms in the molecule.

So, sodium formate (HCOONa) has formate ion (HCOO^-), which has two oxygen atoms. So the product would have two oxygens. That fits.

So, putting it all together:

- X is sodium (Na)
- Y is D2O (heavy water)
- Reaction: 2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + D2↑
- Gas W is D2, with 2 protons and 2 neutrons.
- The precipitate G is NaOD, but wait, sodium deuterium hydroxide is soluble in water. So that doesn't make sense as a precipitate. Hmm, maybe Y isn't D2O. Maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a metal nitrate, and the reaction produces a precipitate. For example, Na reacting with Cu(NO3)2 solution would produce NaNO3 (soluble) and Cu metal as a precipitate. But then the gas wouldn't be W. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, X (say, another metal) reacting with it might produce a precipitate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe X is a different metal. Let's think: perhaps X is potassium.

If X is potassium, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce K+ and acid anion. But again, not sure about the precipitate.

Wait, another idea: perhaps X is a metal that reacts with a solution of a salt to produce a precipitate. For example, if X is Ba, and Y is a solution of Na2SO4, the reaction would produce BaSO4 as a precipitate. But then the gas W would be H2 if Y is an acid, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to think about the elements in X.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present in X, considering isotopes. So, X contains a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Wait, X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope. So, perhaps X is a molecule or a compound containing isotopes. For example, if X is H2O with a heavy isotope, like D2O. Or perhaps X is a metal with an isotope, like a heavier isotope of chlorine.

Wait, but the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has at least two isotopic forms. For example, if X is a molecule containing both H and D, but that's more about the isotopes in the same element.

Wait, X could be something like NaCl, where Cl has heavier isotopes, like Cl-35 and Cl-37. So, in X, perhaps one of the Cl atoms is a heavier isotope.

But the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, the lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1) and the heaviest could be Cl (atomic mass ~35.5). So, sum would be around 36.5, but that's not one of the options. Options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the options.

If X is Na, which has isotopes, the lightest is Na-23 (atomic mass ~23), and heavier isotopes like Na-24, Na-25. So, the lightest is Na-23 (mass ~23) and heaviest, say Na-25 (mass ~25). The sum would be 23+25=48, which isn't an option.

Wait, but the question says to consider all heavier and lighter isotopes present. Oh, wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, no, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, regardless of isotopes. Or maybe it's considering the isotopes for each element present.

Wait, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule with two different elements. For example, if X is NaCl, which is a compound with Na and Cl. Na's atomic mass is about 23, Cl's is about 35.5. So sum would be 23 + 35.5 = 58.5, which is not an option
