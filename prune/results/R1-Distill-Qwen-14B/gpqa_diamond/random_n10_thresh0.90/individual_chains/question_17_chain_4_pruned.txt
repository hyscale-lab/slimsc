Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let's see what it's asking. The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, and it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. I think the formula for the complex is CaEDTA^2- because EDTA is usually in the form of H4EDTA, and when it complexes with Ca^2+, it loses four protons, so the charge is 2-.

But wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. That probably means that the concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- are in a 1:1 ratio, right? Because each Ca^2+ binds one EDTA^4-.

So, the initial concentrations: when the complex dissociates, it would release Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-. But in solution, the complex is present, and the concentration is 0.02 M. So, the total concentration [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M.

I think the dissociation is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + EDTA^4-.

The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-].

Wait, but because the solution is stoichiometric, the complex is at 0.02 M, and assuming it dissociates a little, but perhaps the approximation can be made that [Ca^2+] = [EDTA^4-] = x, and the complex is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into K:

K = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02.

We know K is 5e10. So,

x² = K * 0.02 = 5e10 * 0.02.

Calculating that: 5e10 is 5 x 10^10. Multiply by 0.02, which is 2e-2.

So 5e10 * 2e-2 = (5*2) x 10^(10-2) = 10 x 10^8 = 1e9.

So x² = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4 M? Wait, that can't be right because 3e4 is way larger than the initial concentration of 0.02 M. That doesn't make sense because if x is 3e4, the complex concentration would be 0.02 - 3e4, which is negative. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm confused about the formation constant. Or maybe the way I set up the equation is incorrect. Let me think again.

Formation constant K is for the formation of the complex from the ions. So K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait no, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:

Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-; K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

So when the problem says the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, that's the concentration of the complex. But in solution, some of it dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4-.

So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let the change be dissociation by x. So:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (if x is small)
[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x.

Then K = (0.02) / (x^2) = 5e10.

So rearranging:

x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, wait, let me compute 0.02 = 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

Wait, no: 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e
