Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how the flux changes when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So that probably means the change in the neutrino flux would be detected here now. Because neutrinos usually take about that same time to reach us, right? Oh wait, neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so if the reaction stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos would have left the Sun and arrived here around now. So any changes in the flux would be noticeable immediately after the neutrinos arrive.

But the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, and I need to find which ratio is correct.

First, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. The pp chain is the proton-proton chain, which is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, I think. The pp-I branch is the initial step where two protons fuse to form deuterium. Then, in the pp-II branch, the deuterium fuses with another proton to form tritium, and then in the pp-III branch, the tritium fuses with a proton to form helium-4 and releases a helium-3 nucleus. Alternatively, maybe I have that wrong. Wait, another thought: maybe the pp-III branch is a different part of the chain. Or perhaps the pp-III branch refers to the part where a helium-3 nucleus captures two protons to form a helium-4, but maybe that's part of a different chain, like the CNO cycle? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think the pp chain mainly produces neutrinos through the beta decay of boron-8, which is from the pp-III branch. So if the pp-III branch stops, that would stop the production of those neutrinos.

So, the flux of neutrinos from the Sun is mainly due to the pp chain. Specifically, the dominant neutrinos are from the decay of boron-8, which happens in the pp-III branch. So if the pp-III branch stops, then the number of boron-8 decays would stop, which would drastically reduce the flux of the neutrinos we receive.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of two specific bands. So I need to figure out how the neutrino flux in each band is affected when the pp-III branch stops.

Let me think about the neutrinos produced. The pp chain primarily produces electron neutrinos (ν_e) via the decay of boron-8. So when the pp-III branch stops, the production of these ν_e would stop.

But the Sun also has other sources of neutrinos. Wait, no, I think most of the solar neutrinos come from the pp chain. So if pp-III stops, the main source of neutrinos would be gone.

Wait, but what about other branches? Oh, I think the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain. So stopping it would mean that the main neutrino production stops. So the neutrino flux would drop, but perhaps not immediately because the neutrinos take time to reach us.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, and the neutrinos are arriving now. So any neutrinos that were already on their way would still reach us, but no new ones would be produced. So the flux would drop, but the question is about the ratio between two bands.

Wait a second, the flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. So if the source is suddenly stopped, the flux would drop to zero, but since the neutrinos take time to arrive, the existing neutrinos are still in transit. But I think the question is assuming that the stopping has already happened, and the effect is observed now.

But perhaps more accurately, neutrinos are emitted from the point of production. So if the pp-III process stops, the neutrinos from that process would stop. So any neutrinos that were produced before the stop would still arrive, but new ones wouldn't be produced.

Wait, but the question is about the flux now. So the neutrinos that are in transit would still contribute to the flux, but the flux from the pp-III process would stop. So the flux would drop, but how does that affect the ratio between the two bands?

Wait, but the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in a certain energy range. So if that production stops, the flux in that energy band would decrease, but perhaps other processes contribute to other bands.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos. The main neutrinos from the pp chain have energies around a few hundred keV. The boron-8 decay emits neutrinos with energies up to about 15-16 MeV, but most are around 8 MeV. So the neutrinos from boron-8 are in higher energy ranges. But wait, the question is about bands 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Those are in the MeV range. Wait, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, 800 keV is 0.8 MeV, etc. So that's in the lower MeV range.

Wait, if the pp-III branch is responsible for most of the neutrinos, and if it stops, then the flux in those bands would drop. But what other processes contribute to those bands?

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in higher energy bands, and the lower energy neutrinos come from other sources. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

But let's think again. The pp chain's main neutrino source is the decay of boron-8, which emits ν_e with energies up to about 14 MeV, with an average around 6-7 MeV. So the neutrinos from boron-8 are in higher energy bands compared to the 700-800 keV (0.7 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.9 MeV) ranges. So perhaps the 700-800 keV band is lower energy than the main neutrino flux.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the neutrinos from other processes, like the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch of the pp chain, produce lower energy neutrinos. The pep reaction produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the boron-8 decay.

The pep reaction is part of the proton-proton chain and occurs at a lower rate than the pp-III branch. It produces neutrinos with energies around 1-2 MeV. So, the 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV) bands are in the range of the pep neutrinos. If the pp-III branch stops, the main source of higher-energy neutrinos (from boron-8) would stop, but the pep neutrinos would still be present, albeit in much lower numbers since the total pp chain would be affected.

Wait, no. The proton-proton chain has two main branches: the main one (pp-I and pp-III) and the pep branch. The main pp chain produces boron-8, which decays into alpha particles and emits neutrinos. The pep reaction is another branch where two protons and an electron combine to form deuterium, which then captures another proton to form helium-3. This process emits neutrinos. The neutrinos from the pep branch have lower energies than those from boron-8 decay.

So, the flux in the lower energy bands (like 0.7-0.9 MeV) is dominated by the pep branch, while the higher energy bands (like 1-10 MeV) are dominated by the main pp-III branch (boron-8 decay).

If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos (like those in 1-10 MeV) would stop. However, the production of low-energy neutrinos from the pep branch would continue, albeit at a lower rate if the overall pp chain is affected.

Wait, no. The question says that only the pp-III branch stops. So the other reactions, including the pep branch, remain as they were. So the production of neutrinos in the lower energy bands would continue unchanged, while the higher energy bands (from the pp-III) would stop.

So, the neutrino flux in band 1 (700-800 keV, which is 0.7-0.8 MeV) is mainly from the pep branch. The flux in band 2 (800-900 keV, 0.8-0.9 MeV) is perhaps the start of the higher energy range, which would be from the pp-III branch. But wait, the main pp-III neutrinos are higher than 1 MeV. So maybe in this case, band 2 is the lower edge of where the pp-III neutrinos start.

Alternatively, perhaps the bands are in a region where the main pp-III neutrinos are dominant. So when the pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop to zero, while the flux in band 1 remains the same as before.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of the flux in band 1 to band 2. If the pp-III is stopped, the flux in band 2 would be much lower than in band 1.

Wait, but the flux in band 1 is from the pep branch, which isn't affected. So if the pp-
