Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution when it's in a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions. 

The problem gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. That's the initial concentration of the complex. And the K for the complex is given as 5x10^10, which I think is the formation constant, Kf. Oh wait, right, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

So, the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, and Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be really low, I guess.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So, I need to find [Ca²+]. 

At stoichiometric conditions, the concentration of the complex is equal to the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, assuming they're both 0.02 M before reaction. But wait, no, wait. The complex is formed from the reaction of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the initial concentrations are 0.02 M each, perhaps? Or maybe one of them is in excess. Wait, the problem says it's stoichiometric, which I think means that the amounts are exactly in a 1:1 ratio, so no excess of either.

Wait, when they form the complex, each mole of Ca²+ reacts with one mole of EDTA^4-. So, if I start with 0.02 M of each, the concentration of the complex at equilibrium would be 0.02 M, assuming complete reaction, but wait, I can't assume it's completely reacted because Kf is large but finite. But wait, Kf is 5e10, which is a huge number, so the reaction goes almost to completion. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are very small.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, I think the complex is already formed, and we need to find the free [Ca²+] in solution.

So the initial setup is: the complex is at 0.02 M, and it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The dissociation reaction is CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this reaction would be 1/Kf, because Kf is for the formation. So Kdissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So the expression for Kdissociation is [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-] = 2e-11.

But wait, in solution, the [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] should be equal at equilibrium, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So, let me denote [Ca²+] = x. Then, [EDTA^4-] is also x. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but wait, wait, no. Because if the complex dissociates, the concentration of the complex would be 0.02 minus x. But wait, wait, wait. Let me think about this again.

Wait, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and it dissociates into x moles of Ca²+ and x moles of EDTA^4-, then the concentration of the complex at equilibrium is 0.02 - x. But wait, if K is so small, x will be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, I can approximate [CaEDTA^2-] as 0.02 M.

So, substituting into the K expression:

x * x / 0.02 = 2e-11.

So, x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

So, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7? Wait, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is 2 * 3.16e-7, which is about 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me check. So the calculation is x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = (2e-11) * 2e-2 = 4e-13. So x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈ 6.32e-7, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_{\text{dissociation}} \) is related to the formation constant \( K_f \) by:

\[
K_{\text{dissociation}} = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of free calcium ions \([Ca^{2+}]\) and free EDTA^4- ions \([EDTA^{4-}]\) are equal, denoted as \(x\). The concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately 0.02 M, as \(x\) is expected to be very small due to the large \(K_f\). Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{dissociation}} = \frac{[Ca^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = K_{\text{dissociation}} \cdot 0.02 = (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot 0.02 = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
