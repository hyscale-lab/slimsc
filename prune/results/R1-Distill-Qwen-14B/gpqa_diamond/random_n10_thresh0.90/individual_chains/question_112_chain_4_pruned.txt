Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these concepts yet. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state. Because the coefficients might not sum to 1 in terms of probabilities.

Wait, wait, proportionality. So it's given as proportional, which means I probably have to find the normalization constant. The state is |alpha> = A*(1+i)|up> + A*(2 -i)|down>, right? Because it's proportional by a factor A. So A is the normalization constant.

To find A, I need to compute the norm squared of |alpha>, which is the sum of the absolute squares of the coefficients. So the first coefficient is (1+i), its modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. The second coefficient is (2 -i), modulus squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So |A|^2 *7 =1 (since normalized). Therefore, A = 1/sqrt(7).

So the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix is given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that's an interesting matrix. Let me think about what this operator looks like.

Wait, the operator is 2x2 because we have up and down states. So in the standard basis, the matrix would be:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Because when i≠j, it's ħ/2, else zero. So the diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

Wait, what's the operator with this matrix? Oh, that's a spin operator in the x-direction, but scaled. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (ħ/2) * X. Because Pauli matrices are scaled with ħ/2 for spin-1/2 systems.

Wait, the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So this operator's eigenstates are these |+x> and |-x> states.

So the question is: what's the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates? So we need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then the coefficients' moduli squared will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator is (ħ/2) X, the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, and their corresponding eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively. So measuring the operator will give either ħ/2 or -ħ/2, and the probabilities are |<+x|alpha>|^2 and |<-x|alpha>|^2.

Wait, but the operator in question is (ħ/2) X. So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1), so ± ħ/2.

But the problem says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate. So perhaps I need to expand |alpha> in the eigenbasis of this operator.

So I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. Let me recall what the |+x> and |-x> states are.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions. Let me get the exact expressions.

Yes, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = c1 |+x> + c2 |-x>

So substitute the expressions for |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = c1 (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c2 (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Group |up> and |down> terms:

= [ (c1 + c2)/sqrt(2) ] |up> + [ (c1 - c2)/sqrt(2) ] |down>

But we know |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

So equate the coefficients:

( c1 + c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (1 +i)/sqrt(7)
( c1 - c2 ) / sqrt(2) = (2 -i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these equations as:

(1) c1 + c2 = (1 +i)/sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) = sqrt(7/2) (1+i)
(2) c1 - c2 = (2 -i)/sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) = sqrt(7/2) (2 -i)

Wait, wait. Let me solve for c1 and c2. Let me add and subtract the equations.

Adding (1) and (2):

2 c1 = sqrt(7/2) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ) ] 
= sqrt(7/2) [ 3 + 0i ] 
So c1 = (3 sqrt(7/2)) / 2 = (3/2) sqrt(7/(2)) ) = (3) / sqrt(8) ) * sqrt(7) ?

Wait, let me compute sqrt(7/2) multiplied by 3, divided by 2:

c1 = [ sqrt(7/2) * (3) ) ] / 2 = [3 sqrt(7/2) ] / 2.

Wait, alternatively, sqrt(7/2) is sqrt(14)/2. So 3 * sqrt(14)/2 divided by 2 is 3 sqrt(14) /4.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write:

Equation (1): c1 + c2 = A, where A = (1 +i) sqrt(7/2)
Equation (2): c1 - c2 = B, where B = (2 -i) sqrt(7/2)

Adding (1) and (2): 2 c1 = A + B → c1 = (A + B)/2.
Subtracting (2) from (1): 2 c2 = A - B → c2 = (A - B)/2.

So A = (1 +i) sqrt(7/2)
B = (2 -i) sqrt(7/2)

Compute A + B:

(1+i + 2 -i) * sqrt(7/2) = (3) sqrt(7/2)
So c1 = (3 sqrt(7/2) ) / 2.

Similarly, A - B = (1+i -2 +i) * sqrt(7/2) = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(7/2)
So c2 = (-1 + 2i) sqrt(7/2) / 2.

But wait, maybe I should compute |c1|^2 and |c2|^2 to get the probabilities.

So |c1|^2 is [ (3 sqrt(7/2)/2 ) ]² = 9*(7/2)/4 = (63/8) → 63/8 is 7.875. But wait, probabilities can't be more than 1. That suggests a miscalculation. Wait, that can't be right. Because probabilities can't be greater than 1.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, let me recompute c1 and c2.

Wait, equation (1) and (2) are:

(1) c1 + c2 = (1 +i)/sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) = sqrt(7) (1 +i)/sqrt(2)
Similarly, (2) c1 - c2 = sqrt(7) (2 -i)/sqrt(2)

So let me factor out sqrt(7)/sqrt(2):

c1 + c2 = sqrt(7/2) (1 +i)
c1 - c2 = sqrt(7/2) (2 -i)

Now, adding these two equations: 2 c1 = sqrt(7/2) [ (1 +i) + (2 -i) ) ] = sqrt(7/2) * 3.

So c1 = [3 sqrt(7/2)] / 2.

Similarly, subtracting equation (2) from (1):

2 c2 = sqrt(7/2) [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ) ] = sqrt(7/2) [ (-1 + 2i) ]

So c2 = [ sqrt(7/2) (-1 + 2i) ] / 2.

Now, compute |c1|² and |c2|².

c1 = (3 sqrt(7/2) ) / 2.

|c1|² = (9 * (7/2) ) / 4 = (63/2) /4 = 63/8 = 7.875. Wait, that's more than 1. That can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should have approached this differently. Maybe I should find the eigenstates of the operator and then compute the inner product with |alpha> to find the probabilities.

Let me think again. The operator is A_ij = ħ/2 for i≠j, zero otherwise. So the matrix is:

[ 0,   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

In the standard basis (|up>, |down>). So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as I thought earlier.

So the eigenstates are |+x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> ), and |-x> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down> ).

So to find the probability of measuring the system in |+x>, I compute |< +x
