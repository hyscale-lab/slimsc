Okay, so I have this question about crystallography and interplanar distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question says it's a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal too. So in this case, the angles α, β, and γ are each 30 degrees. Oh wait, rhombohedral is sometimes called the trigonal system, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance—so that's the edge length of the unit cell, right? Because in a crystal, the atoms are arranged periodically, so the edge length 'a' would be the distance between adjacent atoms along one direction. So a=10 Ang.

The question is about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + l^2 + m^2) + other terms involving the angles... wait, no, in a cubic system, it's a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but for non-cubic systems, like rhombohedral, the formula is different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Right, the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is:

1/d² = (h²/a²)(1/(sin² α)) + (k²/(b sin α)^2) (1/sin² β) + ... Wait, maybe I should think of it as the reciprocal of the square of the interplanar distance being the sum involving the structure factors. Alternatively, I think the formula for a rhombohedral system is a bit simpler since all edges are equal (a=b=c) and all angles are equal too.

Wait, the Miller indices here are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1. Since it's a rhombohedral system, the formula for d_hkl is given by:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Oh
