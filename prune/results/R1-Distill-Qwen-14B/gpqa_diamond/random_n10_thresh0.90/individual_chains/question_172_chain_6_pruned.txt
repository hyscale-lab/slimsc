Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think I need to use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor relates the population of different energy states in a thermal distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations between two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (kT), right? So the ratio of excited to ground state or something like that.

So if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2, then the ratio n1/n2 is 2 for the same energy level. Wait, no, wait. Wait a minute, the question says the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So maybe the ratio of their excitation is 2. So if star_1 has a higher excitation, maybe it's hotter?

Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if T is higher, this factor is larger because the exponent becomes a smaller negative number. So for the same energy difference, higher T would mean more population in the upper state.

Wait, in the question, the excitation is higher in star_1. So for the same level, star_1 has more atoms excited, so n1 is higher. So the ratio (n1_upper / n1_lower) would be higher than (n2_upper / n2_lower). Or wait, maybe the question is comparing the same level, but I'm not sure exactly. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps that means the ratio of excited atoms to total atoms in that level is twice as high in star_1. So n1_upper / (n1_upper + n1_lower) is twice n2_upper / (n2_upper + n2_lower).

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the populations of the excited state to the lower state. So if star_1 has a higher ratio than star_2, that would imply higher temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the energy difference is known, so we can relate the temperatures. Let me think. The ratio of the populations (n_upper / n_lower) is equal to (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE
