Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

"Astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, but wait, I think it's actually d in parsecs, so plx in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

The number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But I need to find how N changes with distance r. So I should express N in terms of r, not plx.

Since d is the distance, I'll let r be the distance, maybe in parsecs as well. So r = 1/plx. Therefore, plx = 1/r.

Substituting that into the expression for N: N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/( (1/r)^5 ) is equal to r^5. Because (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so the reciprocal is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait, but the question asks, how does the number change with distance, per unit range? So we're looking for the rate of change of N with r. That would be dN/dr.

Wait, but in the question, it's phrased as "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Oh, maybe it's just asking for the dependence, like N as a function of r, not the derivative.

Wait the question says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Maybe it's asking for the functional form of N as a function of r.

So from earlier, N ∝ r^5. So looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5. So the answer would be B.

Wait, but let me think again. How about the actual relationship between number of stars and distance. Oh, wait, I think in reality, the number of
