Okay, so I've got this problem here about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Let me try to remember what I know about this.

Alright, first, I think a rhombohedral crystal has all sides equal, but the angles between them are all the same. So, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance, which I think is the lattice constant, is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the length of the unit cell edge. So a rhombohedral crystal has a cubic-like structure but with all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a three-dimensional figure with six faces, each being a rhombus.

The interplanar distance is the distance between two parallel planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (h·k + k·l + l·h) * (cosθ) / a² ), but wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, the correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) cosθ )

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Oh right, the interplanar distance formula in a crystal depends on the crystal system. For a cubic system, it's simple, but for rhombohedral, it's a bit more complex. I think the general formula for rhombohedral is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα )

Since all angles are the same (alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees), this simplifies the calculation.

So, in this case, the plane is (111), which means h=1, k=1, l=1. The interatomic distance a is 10 Angstroms, and the angle alpha is 30 degrees.

Putting these into the formula:

First, calculate the denominator. Let's compute the terms:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 +1 = 3.

Then, 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα. Let's compute hk + hl + kl. Each is 1*1, so 1+1+1=3. Multiply by 2: 6. Now multiply by cos(30 degrees). Cos(30) is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

Now add this to the sum of squares: 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So the denominator is the square root of 8.196. Let me compute that. The square root of 8 is about 2.828, and 8.196 is a bit more. Let me calculate:

sqrt(8.196) = approximately 2.863 (because 2.863^2 ≈ 8.196).

So d = a / (sqrt(8.196)) = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstroms? Wait, wait wait, that can't be right because the options are 8-10 Angstroms. Hmm, so I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, I think I confused the formula. Oh, wait, no. Because in a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance is a bit different. Let me double-check the correct formula.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, no, because when the angles are 90 degrees, cosθ is zero, and then it becomes the standard cubic formula. So maybe I had the wrong sign before. Let me think again. Oh, right! The correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosα )

Wait, because for a cubic system, cosα is zero, so it reduces to 1/sqrt( h² +k² + l² ), which is correct.

So let's recalculate with this correct formula.

Given h=k=l=1, alpha=30 degrees, a=10.

Compute the denominator:

h² +k² + l² = 3.

Then, 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha. Since hk + hl + kl = 3, so 2*3*cos(30) = 6*(√3/2) ≈ 6*0.8660 ≈ 5.196.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 5.196). Wait, 3 -5.196 is negative, which is impossible because the square root of a negative number isn't real. That can't be right. So something's wrong here.

Wait, that can't happen because interplanar distances can't be imaginary. So I must have used the wrong formula.

Hmm, maybe I have the formula backwards. Maybe it's plus instead of minus. Let me check. Oh, wait, perhaps I should have:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Because in some sources, the formula is expressed as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + lk) cos α )

Wait, because for a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, cos α = 0, so it becomes the standard 1/sqrt(h^2 +k^2 +l^2) which is correct. So for this problem, I should use this formula.

Let me compute again with the plus sign.

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Sum of squares: 3.

Sum of 2*(hk + hl + kl)*cos α: 2*(3)*(cos 30).

cos30 is about 0.8660, so 2*3*0.8660 = 5.196.

So denominator is sqrt(3 +5.196) = sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863.

So d = 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.493 Angstroms again. But the options are around 9, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm missing a factor. Oh, wait a second. Oh no, wait, in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is not cubic. The interplanar distance formula might be different, perhaps involving the volume of the unit cell or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the reciprocal lattice. The formula for interplanar distance is 1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl)/(a^2) cos α.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. Hmm. Or perhaps I should have used a different approach. Another way to approach this is to calculate the reciprocal of d squared.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look it up mentally. In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ (a^2)/( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, but that's the same as d = a / sqrt( h^2 +k^2 +l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

So, same as before. So with a=10, and the denominator as sqrt(8.196) ≈ 2.863, d is about 3.493 Angstroms.

But the options are all about 9 Angstroms. So something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the interplanar distance, but something else. Wait, no, the question says interplanar distance of the (111) plane.

Wait, perhaps the unit cell is not rhombohedral with a=10, but in a rhombohedral system, a is the lattice parameter. So a=10 Angstrom.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. Another way to compute d is via the Miller indices and the structure of the crystal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of d squared.

Wait, another approach: The formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral crystal can also be expressed as:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α )

But perhaps I should consider that the angles in the formula are the angles between the lattice vectors. So if the angles are 30 degrees, but maybe the formula uses a different convention, such as the angles between the vectors in the lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is 60 degrees instead of 30? Wait, no, the question says alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/a^2 + 2(hk + hl + lk) cos(alpha)/(a^2) [but actually, wait, no, the formula is 1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) (1/a^2) [1 + 2 cos(alpha)/(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) )? No, that can't be.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for the correct formula. I'm a bit stuck, so I'll try to recall. In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = [ a^2 ] / [ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ) ]^(1/2)

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's [a^2/(h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]^(1/2) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should think about the general case. For a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c, and angles alpha, beta, gamma, the formula for interplanar distance is:

1/d^2 = (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2 hk cos gamma/(a b) - 2 kl cos beta/(b c) - 2 lh cos alpha/(a c )

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and alpha=beta=gamma. So substituting:

1/d^2 = (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2(hk cos gamma + kl cos beta + lh cos alpha) / a^2

Since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, and a=b=c.

So:

1/d^2 = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - 2[ hk cos30 + kl cos30 + lh cos30 ] / a²

Factor out cos30 and 2/(a²):

= [ (h² +k² + l² ) - 2 cos30 (hk + kl + lh) ] / a²

So, substituting h=k=l=1:

Numerator: 3 - 2*(√3/2)*3 = 3 - 3√3 ≈ 3 -5.196 ≈ -2.196.

Wait, that's negative. But 1/d² can't be negative. That can't be right. So that suggests that either the formula is wrong, or perhaps the Miller indices are not all 1. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the crystal system.

Wait, perhaps in a rhombohedral system, the angles are 60 degrees instead of 30? Because if I plug in 60 degrees, cos60=0.5, let's see:

For alpha=60 degrees, the numerator becomes 3 - 2*(0.5)*3 = 3 -3=0. So 1/d²=0 → d is infinite, which doesn't make sense either.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Maybe the problem is that the given angles are 30 degrees, which makes the crystal structure different.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for d in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But that led to (3 +5.196) =8.196, sqrt(8.196)=2.863, so d=10/2.863≈3.493 Angstrom. But the options are all in the 8-10 range.

Wait, that's a big discrepancy. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given interatomic distance isn't the lattice parameter a, but the nearest neighbor distance. Hmm, but in a rhombohedral structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a, right? Because each atom is at the corners of the rhombohedron. So a is the edge length.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the cos(30 degrees) part. Let me double-check: cos(30) is about 0.8660. Yes.

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance in the question is not a, but something else. Hmm, the question says "interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom". For a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a√1, but in a rhombohedral, perhaps it's different.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners. So the nearest neighbor distance would be a, because each corner is connected to adjacent ones. So a=10 Angstrom is correct.

Hmm, but the interplanar distance is about 3.49 Angstrom, which is not in the options. So perhaps I messed up the formula entirely.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

But that gives the same result as before. So perhaps the given problem isn't for a rhombohedral but for a hexagonal or another system. No, the question says rhombohedral.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should calculate the volume of the unit cell and then proceed via the volume formula.

The volume V of a rhombohedral unit cell is a^3 * sqrt(1 - 3 cos^2 α + 2 cos^3 α )

But I'm not sure how that helps. Maybe to find the reciprocal vectors?

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal lattice vectors are needed. The formula for the reciprocal lattice vector is 1/d² = (h^2 +k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) + 2(hk cos gamma + kl cos beta + lh cos alpha)/(a^2)

Wait, but in this case, since alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees, and a=b=c.

So 1/d² = (h² +k² +l² + 2hk cos30 + 2kl cos30 + 2lh cos30 ) / a².

Which is the same as the formula I used before. So that brings me back to the same point.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal system? No, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system when angles are 90, but when angles are not, it's a separate system.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of 1/d².

Wait, let me compute the denominator again:

h² +k² +l² =3.

2hk cos30 = 2*1*1*(√3/2) = √3 ≈1.732.

Similarly for the other terms: 2kl cos30 is 1.732, and 2lh cos30 is 1.732.

So the total would be 3 + 1.732 + 1.732 + 1.732 = 3 + 5.196 = 8.196.

So 1/d² = 8.196/(10)^2 → 8.196/100 → 0.08196.

So d²= 1/0.08196 ≈12.2, so d≈3.49 Angstrom. Again, same result.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos alpha/(a²).

So let's try that.

So substituting:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Numerator: 3 - 2*(3) * cos30.

So 3 - 6*(0.866) ≈3 -5.196≈-2.196.

Again, negative, which can't be. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the angles in the formula are the angles between the vectors in the reciprocal space. No, that's probably more complicated.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the given angles alpha, beta, gamma are the angles between the planes, not the angles between the lattice vectors. Hmm, I don't think that's the case.

Wait, maybe I should think of the interplanar distance in terms of the unit vectors. In a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice vectors are a, b, c, each of length a, and the angles between them are alpha, beta, gamma. So the vectors can be represented as:

a = a * (1, 0, 0)

b = a * (cos α, sin α, 0)

c = a * (cos β, (cos γ cos α - sin gamma sin alpha)/(sin alpha), sin gamma / sin alpha )

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the metric tensor for the rhombohedral system.

The metric tensor g is given by:

g = [ [ a², a² cos γ, a² cos β ],
      [ a² cos γ, a², a² cos α ],
      [ a² cos β, a² cos α, a² ] ]

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c, and alpha=beta=gamma=30 degrees.

So the metric tensor becomes:

g = a² * [ [1, cos30, cos30],
            [cos30, 1, cos30],
            [cos30, cos30, 1] ]

Now, the (111) plane corresponds to h=1, k=1, l=1. The interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

d² = (1/(h² +k² +l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2kl cos beta - 2 lh cos alpha )) * (1/(g_11 g_22 g_33)^(1/3) )

Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, the formula for d is:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) * (1/a²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) (cos alpha) / a² )

Which is the same as my initial approach. So I'm back to the same problem.

But in this case, the denominator becomes sqrt( (3) - 2*(3)*(0.866) ) = sqrt(3 -5.196) which is sqrt(-2.196), impossible. So perhaps the (111) planes are not allowed in a rhombohedral system with alpha=30 degrees? But that can't be right because any Miller indices are allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses cos(alpha') where alpha' is 180-30=150 degrees, because sometimes angles in formula are taken as the angles between the vectors as seen from the origin. No, that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should use the absolute value, but that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the given angles are the angles between the crystallographic axes as seen from the origin. So, in a rhombohedral system, the vectors a, b, c form a rhombus. So the angle between a and b is alpha, between a and c is gamma, and between b and c is beta.

Wait, with alpha=30 degrees, the angle between a and b is 30 degrees. So when computing the interplanar distance, the formula would use cos(alpha) as the angle between a and b.

So, perhaps the formula is correct, but the result is negative, which can't be. So that suggests that such a crystal structure isn't possible? Or perhaps I'm missing something about the Miller indices.

Wait, wait, another thought: in some sources, the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is written as:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which gives us a positive denominator.

Wait, in that case, with a=10, and denominator sqrt(8.196) ≈2.863, d=10/2.863≈3.49 Angstroms. But the options are 8-10.

Wait, that's way off. So maybe the problem is that the formula is actually the reciprocal.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reciprocal of d, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and it should be:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which for alpha=30, would require that (h² +k² + l²) > 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha.

For h=k=l=1, 3 - 2*3*(0.866) =3-5.196= -2.196, which is negative. So again, impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the angles given are the angles between the planes, not the lattice vectors. No, that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given angles are 30 degrees but the formula requires the supplementary angle, 150 degrees. Let me try that.

So cos(150 degrees)= -√3/2 ≈-0.866.

So in the formula:

d = a / sqrt(3 + 2*3*(-0.866) )

Which is 3 + 2*3*(-0.866) =3 -5.196= -2.196. Again negative.

No, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the formula should have a minus in front of the cosine term. So:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which in this case, with alpha=30, gives 3 -5.196= -2.196. Which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha )

Which, with alpha=30, gives sqrt(8.196)≈2.863, so d=3.493 Angstrom.

But again, the options are way higher.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually a cubic system, but the angles are 30 degrees. No, the question says rhombohedral.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / [ sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ]

Wait, same as before.

So, I think I'm stuck. The calculation gives me about 3.49 Angstrom, but the options are all higher. Perhaps the question is incorrectly formulated, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the (110) plane instead of (111). Let me try that.

For (110), h=1, k=1, l=0.

Compute denominator:

h² +k² +l²=2.

2(hk + hl + kl)= 2*(1*1 + 1*0 + 1*0 )= 2*1=2.

So 2*(1) * cos30=2*(0.866)=1.732.

So denominator is sqrt(2 +1.732 )=sqrt(3.732)≈1.931.

So d=10/1.931≈5.175 Angstrom.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the plane is (220):

h=2, k=2, l=0.

h² +k² +l²=8.

2(hk + hl + kl)=2*(4 +0 +0 )=8.

So 8 * cos30= 8*0.866≈6.928.

Denominator sqrt(8 +6.928)=sqrt(14.928)≈3.864.

d=10/3.864≈2.585.

No, not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps in the rhombohedral system, the formula is:

d = a / [ sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) ) * sqrt( 1 - 3 cos^2 alpha ) ]

Wait, not sure. Let's try that:

cos30 = 0.866.

So 1 -3*(0.866)^2 =1 -3*(0.75)=1-2.25= -1.25.

So sqrt(-1.25) is not real. Again, impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think about the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral lattice again.

The general formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Which with a=10 and alpha=30, gives 3 +5.196=8.196 → sqrt is 2.863 → d=3.493.

But the options are all much larger. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the choices. But the options don't reflect that.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the reciprocal of the denominator. Like d = a * sqrt(...). No, that would make it even larger.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of the denominator.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is actually about the interatomic distance in the (111) plane, not the interplanar distance. But that's different.

Wait, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes. The interatomic distance in a plane would be the distance between atoms within that plane.

But the question is about interplanar distance. So I think I'm on the right track, but the answer isn't matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should try using the angle as 60 degrees. Let me try.

cos60=0.5.

So denominator is 3 + 2*3*0.5=3+3=6 → sqrt(6)=2.449. So d=10/2.449≈4.082 Angstrom. Still not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 1/d² = (h² +k² +l²)/(a²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha / a².

Then, for h=1, k=1, l=1, alpha=30.

1/d² = (3 - 2*3*0.866)/10².

= (3 -5.196)/100 = (-2.196)/100 → negative, which is impossible.

So perhaps the formula is 1/d² = [ (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos alpha ] / a².

Which gives 8.196 /100 → d^2=100/8.196 ≈12.2 → d≈3.493.

Again, same result.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance. Oh! Maybe I incorrectly assumed that a is 10. But in a crystal, the interatomic distance could refer to the nearest neighbor distance, which in a rhombohedral system would be along the edges, so a. So a=10.

Wait, but perhaps the unit cell is not a cube, so the nearest neighbor distance is a, but the interplanar distance may be different.

Hmm. Another angle: the reciprocal of the interplanar distance is the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. So perhaps the reciprocal lattice vector's magnitude is |G|= 2π/d. But I don't think that helps
