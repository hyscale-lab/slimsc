Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, alright, the setup is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star's radius is the same as the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is about photometric variations due to rotation, which mimics an exoplanet transit. We need to find what radius an exoplanet would have to produce the same brightness variation as the spots.

Wait, so the scenario is that the star has these spots, but if it weren't for the spots, how big would a planet need to be to cause the same dip in brightness. Because when a planet transits a star, it blocks some light, causing a dip, and that dip's depth depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

But in this case, the spots are causing the dip. So we need to model the dip due to the spots and see what planet would give the same dip.

First, let me think about the star without spots. If a planet transits, the drop in brightness is (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet over the area of the star. So the light curve dip is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2.

Now, with the spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into and out of view, the total brightness changes. But since the spots cover one hemisphere, and the star is rotating, as it spins, more or less of the spotted hemisphere comes into view. Wait, but the problem says that the star's hemisphere is covered with spots. So when the star rotates, the spots move into and out of our line of sight.

Wait, the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So 20% of the star's surface is spots. But the spots are cooler. How does that affect the brightness variation?

Wait, the star's Teff is 6000 K. The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spots are 5000 K? Because 6000 - 1000 is 5000. Wait, or is it 6000 minus 1000? Yeah, that's correct.

So the star's luminosity is based on its surface area and temperature. The spots have lower temperature, so when they're on the visible side, the star's total brightness is lower. When the star rotates, the spotted side comes into view and out of view.

But wait, the star is being observed in photometric time series. So as it rotates, the brightness changes. The amplitude of this change would be the difference between when the spots are facing us and when they're not.

But the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet transit, so the variation would be similar to a planet blocking part of the star's light. We need to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve.

So the approach is to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

Let me think about the brightness variation. The star's total brightness without spots would be its normal luminosity. When the spots are visible, the brightness decreases because the spots are cooler. The variation in brightness is the difference between the maximum (no spots visible) and the minimum (max spots visible) divided by the maximum.

Wait, but how do the spots modulate the brightness as the star rotates? Since it's a hemisphere covered, perhaps the maximum effect is when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the other hemisphere is visible. Alternatively, maybe the star's rotation period leads to the spots being seen as a varying amount in the photometric data.

Alternatively, perhaps the variation is due to the spots rotating into and out of view, causing a periodic dip. But the exact model depends on the configuration.

Wait, maybe I should model it as the area of the star that's covered by spots as seen from Earth. The filling factor is 20% of the star's surface. So if the star is a sphere, the surface area is 4πR², and 20% of that is 0.2 *4πR² = 0.8π R². But when the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible can vary. Hmm.

Wait, but the filling factor is the fraction of the entire star's surface covered by spots. So when the star is viewed from Earth, the maximum amount of spots we could see is half of the star's surface (since we see a hemisphere at any time). So if the spots cover 20% of the entire surface, then when the spots are on the near side, the fraction of the visible hemisphere covered by spots is (0.2) / (0.5) )= 0.4, or 40% of the visible hemisphere is spots.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The filling factor is the total spots divided by the total surface. So if the star's radius is R, the surface area is 4πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 *4π R² = 0.8π R². Now, when the star is rotating, any hemisphere we see could have some of the spots. The maximum number of spots we can see is when the entire spotted area is in the same hemisphere we are viewing.

But wait, the spots cover a hemisphere of the star. The question says "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, wait, no. Let me read again: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the entire hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere.

Wait, no, filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the total surface area covered by spots. So if the entire hemisphere is covered, the filling factor would be 0.5, because a hemisphere is half the star's surface. But in this case, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star. So perhaps the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface, and they are located on one hemisphere. Hmm, that seems a bit conflicting.

Wait, maybe the problem says one hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the spots
