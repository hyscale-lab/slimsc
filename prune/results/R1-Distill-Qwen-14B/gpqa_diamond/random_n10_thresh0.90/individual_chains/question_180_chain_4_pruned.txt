Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, the charge is 2e, so each is twice the elementary charge. The particles are in an isolated system, which probably means we're considering all the interactions between them. But wait, 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is that 12 charges are all at the same distance from this point where the 13th is located.

Hmm, the question is about finding the minimum energy of this system. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges can be calculated by summing the potential energies of each pair. Because energy is involved, I think we'll have to calculate the potential energy each charge contributes and then sum them all up.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. Is that affecting anything here? Maybe not directly, because the energy would just be the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So, each charge is 2e. Let me recall Coulomb's law for potential energy between two point charges. The potential energy U between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, all the 12 charges are at 2 meters from the 13th charge. So the 13th is fixed at P, and each of the 12 is 2 meters away from it. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because they are all at the same distance from P, but I don't know their arrangement. Wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, which probably means they are all on the surface of a sphere of radius 2 meters centered at P. But their exact positions relative to each other aren't specified. However, the problem asks for the minimum energy, so maybe all the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the potential energy between them is minimized. Wait, but how?
