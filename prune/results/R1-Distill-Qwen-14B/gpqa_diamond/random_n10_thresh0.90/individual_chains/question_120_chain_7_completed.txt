Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to work through it.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So, uniform distribution means that the number of stars doesn't depend on where you look, right? Now, the main point is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with a different power of 1/plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d). The formula is p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and a parallax of 0.5 pc would be 2 parsecs away. So as parallax decreases, the distance increases.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's think in terms of volume. Because stars are distributed uniformly, the number of stars should depend on the volume of space within a certain distance.

Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if we consider a shell between distance d and d + dd, the volume is the surface area (4πd²) multiplied by dd. But wait, in this case, we're dealing with a range of parallax, not distance. So parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let me express everything in terms of p.

So, the volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/p, that becomes 4π(1/p²) dd. But wait, how does dd relate to the change in parallax? Let's see. If p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. Oh, because d = 1/p, so dd = - (1/p²) dp. So, substituting that into the volume expression.

Volume = 4π(1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, but the negative sign just indicates that as p increases, d decreases, so we can take the absolute value here. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p^4) * dp. Hmm, wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, let me correct that substitution. So, the shell volume is 4 π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of p, since d =1/p, dd is derivative of d with respect to p. So, dd = (-1/p²) dp.

So substituting into the volume:

4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp → 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp.

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but the volume should be positive. So we can write volume as 4π (1/p²)(1/p²) dp? No, that would be 4π (1/p^4) dp. Wait, wait, let me re-express it.

Wait, if d = 1/p, then dd = -d² dp → because derivative of 1/p is -1/p². So dd = -(1/p²) dp.

So plugging into the volume expression: 4π d² dd = 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp.

But since the volume is a positive quantity, we take the absolute value. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp → 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but that would mean the number of stars in a shell with thickness dp (unit of parallax) is proportional to 1/p^4. Because the number of stars is (number density) multiplied by volume. But wait, if the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So the number of stars per unit parallax (dN) is proportional to the volume element, which is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but wait a second. The number of stars per unit range (dp) is dN = n * volume, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

So if the volume per dp is 4π (1/p^4) dp, then dN is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) decreases as 1/plx^4.

So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

Wait but wait, another approach. Let's think about how many stars are within a certain range of parallax. Suppose we have a parallax range from p to p+dp. The corresponding distance ranges from 1/p to 1/(p+dp). The volume between these is the shell volume as we calculated.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp is the number density multiplied by the volume of that shell. Since stars are uniformly distributed, n (number per volume) is constant.

Earlier, we found the volume element dV = 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

So dN = n * dV = n * 4 π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit dp (which is the number per unit range of parallax) is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars depends on the volume of space within a given distance range.

The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by \( 4 \pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), we find \( dd = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). The volume of the shell in terms of \( p \) becomes:

\[
dV = 4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2}\right) dp = 4 \pi \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the volume, as the number density of stars is constant. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( dp \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~1/plx^4**
