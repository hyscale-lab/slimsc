Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so all the particles have the same charge, which is 2e. Since e is the elementary charge, that's about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.204 x 10^-19 C? Wait, no, wait. 2e would be 2 * 1.602e-19, so yes, 3.204e-19 C each.

Wait, but wait a second. The 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So all the other charges are 2 meters away from P, and the 13th is fixed there.

Wait, but the problem is about the electric potential energy of the system. Because in an isolated system, the potential energy would be due to the arrangement of these charges.

So the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Or wait, no. Wait, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work needed to assemble them from infinity, right? So each pair contributes to the potential energy.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So when calculating the potential energy, perhaps we can treat it as a fixed charge and calculate the work done in bringing the other charges into place.

Wait, the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But since all the 12 charges are identical, and each is at a distance r = 2 m from the fixed charge, perhaps the potential energy of the system is the sum of the energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th, plus the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. Because when you have multiple charges, the potential energy includes all possible pairs. So, for example, the energy from the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the energy between each pair of the 12.

But in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So I'm assuming they form a spherical shell of radius 2 m around point P, each at the same distance. So each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, and the 13th is at P.

Wait, but the problem says the 13th is fixed at P, so maybe the 12 others are all at a distance of 2 m from P, which is the location of the 13th charge.

So the potential energy comes from two sources: 

1. The energy due to the 13th charge and each of the 12 charges (12 pairs).
2. The energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges themselves (each pair among
