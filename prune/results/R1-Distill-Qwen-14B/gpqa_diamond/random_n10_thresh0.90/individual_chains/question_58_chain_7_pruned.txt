Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I need to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a process used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right?

Let me think about each option. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Regularization is usually needed when theories have loop divergences. These are problematic because they lead to infinities in calculations. So, when a theory doesn't have such divergences, maybe it doesn't need regularization?

Wait, Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED does have divergences, so it requires regularization. But what about when you calculate certain things, like the electron self-energy? Oh right, you need to regularize those integrals to get meaningful results. So C) QED definitely requires regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It also deals with things like quarks and gluons. I think QCD has similar issues with divergences, especially with things like the running coupling and confinement. So B) QCD probably requires regularization too.

How about Superstring Theory? Oh wait, superstring theory is a type of string theory, which is a candidate for a theory of everything. String theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that QED and QCD have. Because in string theory, particles are extended objects, and interactions are between strings, which might lead to better behaved calculations. So A) Superstring Theory might not need regularization.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Do string theories avoid all divergences? I think they do, at least perturbatively. Or maybe they don't require the same kind of regularization because the underlying structure is different. So if that's right, then Superstring Theory doesn't need regularization.

Then, option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, Maxwell's equations. In classical theory, there are no infinities like point charges having infinite self-energy. Or wait, in classical E&M, you can have issues like the infinite charge density of a point charge. So do you need regularization there? Hmm, in regularization, it's often a quantum field theory tool. So maybe classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have loop diagrams and the same divergences. So D) Classical Electrodynamics doesn't require regularization either.

Wait, but the question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So if D is a classical theory, perhaps it doesn't have these divergences because it's not a quantum theory. But the question is about "physical theories"â€”so both quantum and classical are in the options.

Let me think again. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So perhaps it's either A or D.

Wait, regularizations are techniques used in handling divergences that arise in quantum theories. So classical theories don't really need regularization because they don't have the same divergent integrals. So D) Classical Electrodynamics doesn't need regularization because it's a classical theory and doesn't have the same issues as quantum theories. But then, what about the other options?

So the question is a bit tricky. Let's break it down:

The theories which are quantum (QED, QCD, Superstring) might require regularization. But wait, superstring theory is also a quantum theory, but perhaps it doesn't have the same divergences because it's a theory of strings. So maybe it doesn't need regularization.

So, the options are:

A) Superstring Theory: probably doesn't need regularization because it's finite.

B) QCD: needs regularization.

C) QED: needs regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: doesn't need regularization because it's classical.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. So both A and D, perhaps.

Wait, but let's think about which theories are known for not requiring regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical theories don't need it. So option D wouldn't require regularization because it's classical. So the answer could be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

But wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if a theory is always finite, even when quantized, then it doesn't require regularization.

But wait, Quantum Electrodynamics, when treated with renormalization, requires dealing with divergences, which is done through regularization. So QED definitely requires it.

But what about string theory? I remember that string theory is supposed to be finite, meaning no divergences. So in superstring theory, you don't get the same types of divergent loop integrals as in QED or QCD. So perhaps it doesn't require
