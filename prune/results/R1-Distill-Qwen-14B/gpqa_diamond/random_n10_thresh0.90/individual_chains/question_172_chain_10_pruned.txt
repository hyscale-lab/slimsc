Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, and if it's in LTE, that means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, the atoms are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding plasma.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the excitation levels relate to the temperature somehow. I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution, which describes how particles distribute among energy states at a certain temperature.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so the energy difference ΔE is k * something. Maybe ΔE = k * T * ln(N_upper/N_lower)?

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Here, E_i is higher than E_j because it's an excited state. So, the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E_upper - E_lower.

In the question, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level. Let's denote N_1 as the population in star_1 and N_2 in star_2. So, N_1 = 2 * N_2.

The ratio N_1 / N_2 = 2 = (g_1/g_2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Assuming that the ground states are similar, the g factors (statistical weights) might be the same for both stars, so g_1/g_2 = 1. So, the equation simplifies to:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k T_2) - ΔE/(k T_1) )

Because when you divide the exponentials, it's ΔE/(k T_2) - ΔE/(k T_1) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

So, 2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, wait. Because when you take ln of exp(x), it's x. So:

ln(2) = (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

But wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J, and k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So, ΔE = k * something. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Ah, right, so ΔE/(k) is 1 K. Therefore:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which simplifies to:

ln(2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Hmm, but let's rearrange that:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, no. Let me double-check the algebra. Let me denote 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So, putting that into the equation:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) ] / (T1 T2 )

Which is the same as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So that matches.
