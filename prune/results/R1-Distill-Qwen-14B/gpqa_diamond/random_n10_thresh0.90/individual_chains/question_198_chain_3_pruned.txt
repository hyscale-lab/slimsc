Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, wait. I remember that the stability constants are for the formation of complexes. So the higher the β, the more stable the complex is. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

I think the complexes form in a stepwise manner. So the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]^+, the second [Co(SCN)₂]^(3-), the third [Co(SCN)₃]^(?), and the fourth [Co(SCN)₄]^4-? Or maybe I should think about the charges. Let me think: Co²+ with SCN^-.

Each SCN adds a negative charge. So for the first complex, Co²+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+, which has a +1 charge. Wait, no: wait, the initial ion is Co²+. Adding one SCN^- would give [Co(SCN)]^+ because 2+ - 1- = +1. Hmm, maybe. So the series would be Co²+ (free ion), then [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1), then [Co(SCN)₂]^(3-)? No, because each SCN is -1. Wait, no: if the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^(3-n), because Co²+ is +2, and each SCN is -1. So for n=1: +1, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the charge isn't crucial for this problem, but more about the stability constants.

The stability constant β is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So β1 is for the first step: Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for the second step: [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)₂]^, and so on.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm not entirely sure which complex that is, but I think blue is associated with the [Co(SCN)₂]^(something) complex. Wait, I've read before that the [Co(SCN)₂]^(n) complexes are blue, but I might be mixing up the colors. Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)₃]^− is another color. Wait, I'm not entirely certain, but the question refers to the dithiocyanato complex, which would be with two SCN ligands, so [Co(SCN)₂]^0? Or perhaps [Co(SCN)₂]^(something else). Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "blue dithiocyanato." So dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]^(n). What's the charge?

Co²+ plus 2 SCN^- gives [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (charge neutral). So that's the complex with two SCN ligands.

So we're looking for the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 among all the Co species.

The solution contains various species: free Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^−, and [Co(SCN)₄]^2−. The sum of all these should equal the total cobalt concentration, which is 0.01 M.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex relative to each other, using the stability constants, and then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato complex.

Stability constants are cumulative, meaning each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth step. So the overall β for each complex is the product of the previous βs. Wait, no. Wait, I think the overall formation constant K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn. So for [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1), K = β1 =9. For [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (n=2), K = β1 * β2 =9*40=360. For [Co(SCN)₃]^− (n=3), K=9*40*63=9*40 is 360, 360*63=22680. And for [Co(SCN)₄]^2− (n=4), K=9*40*63*16. Let me compute that: 9×40=360, ×63=22680, ×16=362880.

But wait, the problem gives each β as the stepwise constant, so the overall K for each complex is the product up to that step.

So the fraction of each species can be determined by these K's and the concentrations of SCN^- and Co²+.

But wait, the solution has a fixed [SCN^-] of 0.1 M. So the approach is to use the formation constants and the concentrations to calculate the distribution of Co species.

Alternatively, since the problem is about finding the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is the dithiocyanato complex, perhaps the way to proceed is to model the distribution of the different complexes.

Each species can be represented as:

Co²+ → free ion.

[Co(SCN)]^+ → complex with 1 SCN.

[Co(SCN)₂]^0 → complex with 2 SCN.

[Co(SCN)₃]^− → 3 SCN.

[Co(SCN)₄]^2− → 4 SCN.

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, so the fraction of each species depends on the product of the β's up to that point, and the concentration of SCN.

Hmm, the formula for the fraction of each species can be found using the cumulative βs and the [SCN^-] concentration.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution can be calculated using the stability constants and the concentrations.

The fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN^-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1 β2 ... β4 [SCN^-]^4)

Wait, but wait, each step's β is multiplied by the previous ones, so the overall K for [Co(SCN)_n] is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the denominator is the sum over all possible species (n=0 to n=4) of K_n [SCN^-]^n, but wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN^-]^m)

where K_0 = 1 (since it's the free ion, Co²+), and K_1 = β1, K_2 = β1 β2, etc.

Wait, let's clarify: each species [Co(SCN)_n] has an overall formation constant K_n which is the product of the β's up to step n. So for n=0, K_0=1 (no complexes formed). For n=1, K_1=β1=9. For n=2, K_2=β1 * β2=9*40=360. For n=3, K_3=9*40*63=22680. For n=4, K_4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So each species contributes K_n [SCN^-]^n to the numerator, and the denominator is the sum over all n from 0 to 4 of K_n [SCN^-]^n.

But wait, the free ion is n=0, so [Co²+] is K_0 [SCN^-]^0 = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1. So the denominator is 1 + K_1 [SCN] + K_2 [SCN]^2 + K_3 [SCN]^3 + K_4 [SCN]^4.

Now, let's compute each term:

K_0 [SCN^0] = 1 * (0.1)^0 = 1.

K_1 [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

K_2 [SCN]^2 = 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01= 3.6.

K_3 [SCN]^3 = 22680 * (0.1)^3 =22680 * 0.001 =22.68.

K_4 [SCN]^4 =362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Now sum all these terms:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9.

1.9 +3.6=5.5.

5.5 +22.68=28.18.

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction f_n for each n is (K_n [SCN]^n) / 64.468.

We need f_2, which is K_2 [SCN]^2 / 64.468.

K_2 [SCN]^2 is 3.6.

So f_2 = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is approximately 5.557%.

Wait, that can't be right because none of the options are that low. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, the denominator was sum from n=0 to 4:

n=0:1,

n=1:9*0.1=0.9,

n=2: 360 * 0.01=3.6,

n=3: 22680 *0.001=22.68,

n=4:362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So adding these:

1 + 0.9 =1.9,

1.9 +3.6=5.5,

5.5 +22.68=28.18,

28.18 +36.288=64.468. That seems correct.

Then f_2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is about 5.557%. But none of the options are near 5.5%. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So I must have made a mistake in the approach. Hmm. Maybe I messed up the formation constants or the way the complexes are considered.

Wait, maybe the stability constants I'm using are the overall constants, not stepwise. Or perhaps I have the wrong species.

Wait, let me re-examine the stability constants. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants can sometimes refer to the log of the formation constant. But in the problem statement, it's written as β1=9, which I assume is the actual formation constant, not the logarithm. Because if they were log β, then we'd have to take the antilog, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the order of the complexes. Maybe the β values are for the stepwise addition, so each β is the equilibrium constant for adding one more SCN^- ion.

Wait, perhaps the way to model the distribution is different. Maybe each complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^m, and the fraction is determined by the product of the β's up to that n.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion.

The general expression for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did earlier. So why am I getting a fraction around 5.5%, which isn't in the options?

Hmm. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the K values.

Wait, let me re-calculate each K_n:

K_1 = β1 =9.

K_2 = β1 * β2 =9 *40=360.

K_3=β1 * β2 * β3=9 *40 *63 = 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

K_4=9*40*63*16=22680 *16=362880.

Wait, 16 times 22680: let's compute that.

22680 *16: 22680 *10 =226800; 22680*6=136080. Sum: 226800 +136080=362880. Correct.

So K_4 is 362880.

Now, [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is 0.1.

So each term is K_n * (0.1)^n.

n=0:1 *1=1.

n=1:9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:360 * 0.01=3.6.

n=3:22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4:362880 *0.0001
