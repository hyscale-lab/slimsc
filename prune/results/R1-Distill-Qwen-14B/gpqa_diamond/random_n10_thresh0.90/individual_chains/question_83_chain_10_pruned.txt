Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titration. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water, and then titrating it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will produce acetate ions and water. The reaction should be something like CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So, that makes sense.

But wait, before anything, let's figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Oh right, when you mix two solutions, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula. So the initial step is to calculate the concentration of acetic acid after mixing with water.

So, the initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³, and concentration is 0.05 M. Then we add 20.00 cm³ water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. The number of moles of acetic acid remains the same because we're just adding water. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles / total volume. So that's 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh wait, wait! Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, right. So yeah, 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with NaOH, the first part is the 25% titration point. So what does that mean? I think it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, we need to find the pH at that point.

Wait, but let's think about the equivalence point first, maybe. Because sometimes knowing that can help. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, how many moles of NaOH are needed for equivalence?

The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 (from 0.05 M * 0.02 L). So moles of NaOH needed would be the same, 0.001 moles, because the reaction is 1:1. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume required would be (moles)/(concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So, the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, the question is about 25% titration. That means 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So up to that point, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

So, let's find the moles of NaOH added. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, this would convert 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH to CH3COO^-.

So the initial moles of CH3COOH were 0.001, so after adding NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of CH3COO^- produced would be 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume now is the original solution (40 cm³) plus the NaOH added (2.5 cm³). So total volume is 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since the solution is a buffer (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

Wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/1.85e-5) ≈ let me calculate that. Log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, no, wait. Because pKa = -log(Ka). So 1.85e-5, so log(1.85) is approx 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So, back to the Henderson equation. [A^-] is 0.005882 and [HA] is 0.017647. So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. So log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. Hmm, so around 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. But let me see if I did the calculations correctly.

Wait, let me double-check the moles. Initial moles: 0.001. 25% of that is 0.00025. So CH3COOH left is 0.00075, correct. Then the volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. So 0.0425 L. So [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M. [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. The ratio is 1/3. So log(1/3) is -0.477. So 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So pH is approximately 4.26. So the first pH is 4.26.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

At equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.1 M), so moles of NaOH = 0.001 (as calculated earlier). So moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) would be 0.001 moles. The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The acetate ion will hydrolyze in water: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.
