Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P.

But wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh right, that's important. So the operator P must be along that direction. So the operator P is probably the sum of its components multiplied by the direction cosines. Because in quantum mechanics, the operator for angular momentum along a direction n is given by n · P, which would be nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z.

Wait, but n is in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So n lies in x-z plane, so n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

So the operator P is along direction n, so P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). But actually, wait, the operator for the component along n is n·P, right? So P would be n·P. But wait, the question says: calculate the eigenvector of the operator P_vec along n. So operator P is n·P, where each P component is given.

Wait, maybe I should represent P as a vector operator whose components are given by P_x, P_y, P_z. Then, the operator along n is P·n = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. Since n is in x-z plane, ny=0. So P = nx P_x + nz P_z.

So first, I need to compute the matrix for the operator P as nx P_x + nz P_z.

Let me write down each component's matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P = nx * P_x + nz * P_z. But since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² =1.

So the matrix for P is:

(ħ/2) [ (nz) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] + nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] ]

So P = (ħ/2) [ [nz, nx], [nx, -nz] ]

Because when you add the matrices, the (1,1) element is nz * 1, (1,2) is nx *1, (2,1) is nx *1, and (2,2) is -nz.

So the matrix form is:

[ nz   nx ]
[ nx  -nz ]

multiplied by ħ/2.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2) to get:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

nz a + nx b = a
nx a - nz b = b

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: nz a + nx b = a → (nz -1) a + nx b = 0
Equation 2: nx a - nz b = b → nx a - (nz +1) b = 0

Hmm, so we have a system of two equations.

Let me write them as:

(nz -1) a + nx b = 0 → (1 - nz) a = nx b → a = (nx/(1 - nz)) b

Similarly, nx a = (nz + 1) b → a = [(nz + 1)/nx ] b

Wait, that doesn't seem right because if I have a = (nx/(1 - nz)) b from the first equation, and a = [(nz + 1)/nx ] b from the second equation, then these two expressions for a must be equal.

So,

(nx/(1 - nz)) b = [(nz + 1)/nx ] b

Assuming b ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by b:

nx/(1 - nz) = (nz +1)/nx → nx² = (nz +1)(1 - nz) → nx² = (1 - nz²) + nz - nz.

Wait, (nz +1)(1 - nz) = (1)(1 - nz) + nz (1 - nz) = 1 - nz + nz - nz² = 1 - nz².

So, nx² = 1 - nz².

But since nx² + nz² = 1 (because it's a unit vector), substituting, 1 - nz² = nx² → which holds. So that's consistent.

So the two conditions are the same, and we can proceed with one of them.

So, from equation 1:

a = [nx / (1 - nz)] b

We can write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [ nx/(1 - nz) b; b ] = b [ nx/(1 - nz), 1 ]^T

But since we can choose b as a scaling factor (eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple), let's set b=1 for simplicity. Then a = nx/(1 - nz).

Wait, but eigenvectors must be normalized. So the eigenvector is [ a, 1 ]^T, and its norm is sqrt(|a|^2 + |1|^2) = sqrt( |a|^2 + 1 ). So to normalize, we divide by this value.

But wait, let me compute a. a = nx/(1 - nz). Let me think about the denominator, 1 - nz.

Alternatively, since we have a parameterization, maybe it's easier to express the eigenvector in terms of angles. Since direction n is in the x-z plane, we can express it in spherical coordinates with θ being the angle from the z-axis.

So, for a unit vector in x-z plane, θ is the polar angle in the x-z plane. So, nx = sinθ cosφ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the standard spherical coordinates have x = sinθ cosφ, y = sinθ sinφ, z = cosθ. But since our direction is in x-z (so y=0), maybe it's better to parameterize in terms of θ where θ is measured from the z-axis.

So, in that case, the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because when θ=0, you're at +z, when θ=90 degrees, you're in +x, etc.

Wait, but for a general direction in the x-z plane, let me define the angle θ as the angle between the direction vector n and the z-axis. So n is (
