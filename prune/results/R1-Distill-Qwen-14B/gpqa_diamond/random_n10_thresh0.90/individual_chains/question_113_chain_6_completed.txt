Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they've used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. So, I need to figure out which one is correct based on the given data.

Let me start by looking at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak from O-H stretching. Also, the presence of a peak at 1700 cm^-1 is strong. I think that's a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl or maybe something else like an amide, but I don't think amides are in the options here. Alternatively, it could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. That might explain why the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. Oh, right, because vinyl hydrogens are in the NMR, so maybe there's a double bond nearby, like an enone structure or something similar.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically around 4.5-7 ppm, but more precisely, the exact region depends on the substituents. If there's a carbonyl nearby, like in an enone, the vinyl protons might be deshielded and appear around 5-6 ppm. But I'm not too sure about the exact shifts, but the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests either an alkene or some conjugated system.

Now, mass spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments include the methyl group (15), but 45 is bigger. Maybe something with a carbonyl. Let's think: 45 could be a fragment that includes a carbonyl group. For example, the tropylium ion is m/z 91, but that's too big. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment. Wait, 45 is the same as (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but that's 58. Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me think about possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments.

Looking at the options:

Option A) C6H12O2: molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72 +12 +32=116.

Option B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10*1)+(16) =72 +10 +16=98.

Option C) C6H10O2: (6*12)+(10*1)+(32)=72+10+32=114.

Option D) C6H12O: 72 +12 +16=100.

If the mass spec shows a peak at 45, what could that come from? Well, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about possible fragments. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps it could lose a fragment. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks into smaller parts. Let's consider each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible fragments? Let's see, if it's an ester, say, R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could break into the ester group. The ester group (O-CO-O) could split into a carbonyl group. Wait, perhaps the fragment is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl, but that's too small. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment like (CH3)2CO, which is acetone (58), but that's larger than 45. Alternatively, perhaps the loss of the ester oxygen, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula can help. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as: DoU = [2C +2 - H - X + N]/2. Assuming no halogens or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So 1 DoU could be a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option B: C=6, H=10, O=1.

DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond.

Option C: C=6, H=10, O=2.

DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees.

Option D: C=6, H=12, O=1.

DoU=(14-12)/2=1. One degree.

So considering the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the compound has at least one double bond, which is a DoU. So, the other DoU would be a ring, or another double bond.

Looking back at the IR data: peak at 1700 could be a carbonyl, which is a DoU. So the compound has a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond. So, two DoU. That would match options B and C, because they have DoU of 2. So options A and D have only one DoU, but the presence of a carbonyl and a double bond (from vinyl H) suggests two DoU. So this narrows it down to B or C.

So options B and C are C6H10O and C6H10O2. Now, what else can help me determine between these two.

Looking at the IR, the 1650 cm^-1 peak. I'm trying to think about what that could be. If there's a carbonyl at 1700, maybe the 1650 is an conjugated double bond. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, the conjugated double bond would have a lower wavenumber, maybe around 1650. So maybe the compound is something like an enone, like cyclohexenone derivative. But then, the presence of O in the formula would vary.

Wait, but the FTIR also showed a very broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is probably an O-H group. So the compound has an O-H. So it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak is very broad and around 2500-3300. But in the IR, the O-H would show a very broad peak, but carboxylic acids also typically have a strong peak around 1700 (carbonyl). So that fits with an O-H and a carbonyl. Also, in that case, the molecular formula must include two O's, since a carboxylic acid is RCOOH.

Looking at the options, only options A, C, and B have O in the formula. Wait, no: option B is C6H10O, which would be a mono-oxygen compound. If it's a carboxylic acid, you need two O's (COOH). So the formula would need to be C6H10O2, which is option C, or C6H12O2 (option A). Wait, option A is C6H12O2. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid, then it would have two O's.

So, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would have O2. So for a six-carbon carboxylic acid, the formula is C6H12O2 (like hexanoic acid), but wait, that's if it's a saturated acid. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So the acid might be unsaturated, which would reduce the number of H's. Let's think: hexanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is C6H12O2. If it's an unsaturated version, like cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the formula would be C6H10O2. Because each double bond reduces two H's.

So, if the compound is an unsaturated carboxylic acid (like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH or something), the formula would be C6H10O2. So that's option C.

Let me check the other data points. The FTIR's broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 is consistent with an O-H (carboxylic acid). The 1700 cm^-1 is the carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated acid). For example, if the acid is something like CH2=CHCOOH, but that's only three carbons. Wait, but the compound is C6, so perhaps a longer chain with a conjugated double bond near the COOH group.

In the 1H NMR, the presence of vinyl hydrogens (like around 5 ppm) would make sense if there's a double bond nearby. So, for example, in a structure where the double bond is conjugated to the carbonyl, such as an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Now, the mass spectrum: the fragment at m/z=45. Let me think about what that could be. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (which is 31), but that doesn't add up. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH2(OH)COOH? No, that's 91. Wait, maybe a fragment like CH2=CHCO+? Let me think about possible fragments.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps it breaks into an acyl and an alkoxy part. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the mass spec might show the loss of CO2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 45 g/mol. Let me think of the possible formula for a fragment with m/z 45. Let's see: 45 is 45 grams per mole. So, possible combinations:

- C3H7O: molecular weight would be (3*12)+(7)+(16)=36+7+16=59. No.

- C2H5O2: 2*12 +5 +32=24+5+32=61. No.

Wait, perhaps it's a ketene? No. Alternatively, maybe a methyl ester group. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. But acetone has a molecular weight of (2*12)+(3*1)+16=24+3+16=43. Hmm, not 45. So that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. No. Or maybe a smaller ring, like cyclopentyl (C5H9+?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the fragment is (CH2)2CO+? Let's see: (2*12) + (4*1) + 16=24+4+16=44. Close, but not 45. Alternatively, (CH3)CO+ would be 43 (31 + 12?), not sure.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH-O- group, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, looking at molecular formulas, what about CH3CH2COOH? No, that's a larger molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl. Wait, if the compound is an ester like methyl something, then the fragment could be CH3O- something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the possible molecular weights for the options and see what their fragments could be.

Option C is C6H10O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(10)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

So the molecular ion would be at 114. But in mass spec, the base peak is the molecular ion, but other fragments can form. So maybe the molecule breaks into a fragment that's 45.

Wait, 114 minus 45 is 69. So if the molecular ion breaks off a 45 fragment, the remaining would be 69. What could 45 be?

Alternatively, perhaps 45 is a part of the molecule. For example, maybe the molecule has a propenoate group. Let me think: propenoic acid is CH2=CHCOOH, molecular formula C3H4O2. Its molecular weight is 72. But our compound has C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a larger structure, like an ester derived from propenoic acid.

Wait, another angle: The mass of 45 could correspond to (CH3)2CO, which is acetone, but m/z 43. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment with a carbonyl and something else.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. For example, a ketone group is (CO), but that's 28. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CHCO+ group. Let's calculate that: CH2=CHCO+ is C3H4O. Molecular weight is 3*12 +4 +16=36+4+16=56. No, that's not 45.

Wait, another possible fragment: methyl propenoate. The formula is CH2=CHCOOCH3. Wait, no, that's a larger molecule. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the acylium ion. For example, (RCO)+, but that would have a molecular weight depending on R.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a smaller part of the molecule. Let's think about the possible formulas.

45 can be C3H7O, which is (3*12)+(7)+(16)=36+7+16=59. No. Or C3H3O2: 3*12=36, H3=3, O2=32. Total 71. No. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Let me think about possible functional groups. Since the IR shows a broad peak (O-H) and a strong peak at 1700 (carbonyl), and a peak at 1650 (possibly conjugated double bond), and the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, I'm thinking the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

So, the formula would have two O's. So among the options, that's C6H10O2 (option C) and C6H12O2 (option A).

Now, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation are 2: one from the double bond, another from the carboxylic acid (which is a carbonyl and O-H). Or wait, carboxylic acid is -COOH: that's a carbonyl (one DoU) and a double bond in the O-H (no, O-H is single bond). So the DoU comes from the double bond in the COOH group (the carbonyl) and any rings or double bonds elsewhere.

Wait, the formula for option C is C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU: maybe a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

If the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, that would account for two DoU: the double bond in the alpha,beta position and the carbonyl in the COOH group. So that fits.

So, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH, but that's a six-carbon with a double bond at the alpha,beta position. Wait, but wait: the formula for that would be C6H10O2. Because each double bond reduces two H's. The saturated version (hexanoic acid) is C6H12O2, which would have 12 H's. So if it's unsaturated, with one double bond, it would have 10 H's, making it C6H10O2, option C.

So the molecular formula would be option C.

Now, the mass spec: what fragment would give m/z 45. If the compound has a propenoate group or something like that. Let's think about the structure of the compound. Suppose it's something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. The molecular weight is 114 (from earlier calculation).

If the molecule breaks off a fragment that's, say, the part after the double bond. For example, if the molecule breaks into CH2=CHCH2- and CH2COOH. The CH2=CHCH2- fragment would be C3H5, which is 3*12 +5=41. Doesn't match 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the COOH group plus something. The COOH group is 44 g/mol (COOH is 12+16+16 +1+1? Wait, COOH is -COOH: molecular weight is (12+16*2 +1+1)= 12+32+2=46. Wait, that's 46. But the fragment is at 45, which is one less. Hmm, maybe the loss of a proton or something.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH2COOH, which is 59. No, that's higher.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment might be a ketene ion. A ketene has the formula O=C=O, but that's more for smaller molecules. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a smaller carbonyl-containing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester. Wait, but earlier I thought it was a carboxylic acid because of the broad O-H peak. But an ester would have an O-H? No, esters don't have O-H; they have an O connected to an R group. So the broad peak would more likely be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, going back to the NMR: the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond. So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, it would have both a double bond and a carbonyl group.

So, the formula is C6H10O2 (option C). Now, the mass spec fragment of 45. Let me think about that again. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and the molecular weight is 114, what fragment would have a mass of 45?

Hmm, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group plus something. Wait, 45 is about the same as (CH2)2COOH, which would be C3H6O2. Wait, (3*12)+(6)+(32)=36+6+32=74. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is CH2=CHCOO- (from an ester, but I'm not sure). CH2=CHCOO- would be C3H4O2, which is 3*12 +4 +32=36+4+32=72. No.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone. If the molecule has a ketone group, perhaps it loses a part to form a smaller ketone as a fragment. For example, acetone (43), but not matching 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the COO- group. The COO- would have a mass of 44 (12+16*2=44). But 44 is close to 45. Maybe it's losing a hydrogen or something. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl ketone, like (CH3)CO which is 43. Not matching.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible structure. If the compound is (E)-3-pentenoic acid or something similar. Let's say it's a six-carbon alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid, like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. The molecular weight is 114.

In mass spectrometry, the molecule can fragment in different ways. For example, the molecule might lose a water molecule (18) or a CO2 (44). If the molecular ion is at 114, losing 18 would give 96, which I don't know. Losing 44 would give 70, perhaps.

Alternatively, another possible fragment could be the loss of the COOH group as CO2 and leaving a C5H9 fragment. But 45 is less than half of 114.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks into a smaller fragment that has 45. Let me think about the possible structures again. Suppose the molecule is cyclohexene carboxylic acid. The structure would be a cyclohexene ring with a COOH group attached. Then, the ring might break during fragmentation.

But I'm not sure. Another angle: the molecular formula of the compound is C6H10O2. If the fragment is 45, which is C3H7O, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, the fragment could be C2H5COO- (57), but that's not matching.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the mass spec part. Maybe I should focus more on the other data points. The FTIR indicates O-H (carboxylic acid) and carbonyl. The NMR indicates a double bond (vinyl H). So the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid with formula C6H10O2.

Looking at the options, that's option C.

So the answer should be option C.


The unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid. A strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, and the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ may correspond to a conjugated double bond, such as in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes peaks for vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with a smaller fragment containing a carbonyl group.

The molecular formula must account for the observed data: a carboxylic acid (two oxygen atoms) and a double bond (one degree of unsaturation). The degrees of unsaturation (DoU) for each option are calculated as follows:

- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):** DoU = 1 (saturated compound). This does not match the presence of a double bond.
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):** DoU = 2 (one double bond and one ring). However, this formula lacks a second oxygen atom required for the carboxylic acid group.
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):** DoU = 2 (one double bond and one carbonyl group). This matches the data, as it includes a carboxylic acid and a conjugated double bond.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):** DoU = 1 (saturated compound). This does not match the presence of a double bond.

The compound is identified as an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid with the formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 could correspond to a smaller fragment, such as a carbonyl-containing group, consistent with the structure. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
