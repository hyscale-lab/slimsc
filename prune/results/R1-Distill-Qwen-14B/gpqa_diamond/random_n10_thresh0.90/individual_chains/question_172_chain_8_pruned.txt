Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down. 

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, right, the excitement of atoms relates to their energy levels. I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution here. 

Boltzmann distribution... yeah, it describes the probability of particles being in a certain energy state in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels. Oh right, the formula is (n2/n1) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In the question, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, let me think. The problem states that the excitation is twice as much in star 1. So n1 (for star 1) is twice n2 (for star 2) for the same energy level. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me read again.

Ah, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, the population ratio is n1 = 2 * n2. So n1/n2 = 2.

So according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) where ΔE is E2 - E1. Wait, but wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So the energy levels have a difference of ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. 

Wait wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So in this case, the upper state is higher energy, so lower population.

But in the question, star_1 has twice as excited, meaning twice as many in the higher energy level? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, actually, the question says 'specific energy level are twice as excited.' So if it's the same energy level but more excited, maybe it's that the number of atoms in that excited state is higher. 

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: when we talk about excitation, higher excitation means more atoms in higher energy levels. So if star_1 has twice as excited, then the population in that higher energy level is higher in star_1 than in star_2.

So for each star, the ratio of the excited level to the ground level (or another lower level) would be given by the Boltzmann factor. Let's say the ground level is state 1, and the excited state is state 2. So for star 1, n2_1 / n1_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2, n2_2 / n1_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that the population in the excited level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, not exactly. The question says that the iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Hmm, maybe it's the ratio of the excited level to the lower level.

Wait, perhaps it's the ratio between the two stars. Let me think: Let's say for each star, the ratio of the excited state population (n_upper) to the lower state (n_lower) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

For star 1: n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star 2: n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star1 is twice that of star2. So:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1) = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2 )

So taking the ratio of the two ratios:

(n_upper1/n_lower1) / (n_upper2/n_lower2) ) = 2

Which is [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = 2

Simplify the left side: exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2

So, the exponent can be written as ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So, exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Take the natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.693.

Now, we can rearrange this equation to solve for T1 and T2.

Let me write it as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) )/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

But solving for the temperatures, perhaps we can express it in terms of T1 and T2. But the options don't involve ΔE or k. Hmm.

Wait, the options have ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2. So perhaps we can arrange the equation to have ln(2) on one side.

Let's see:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

But wait, ΔE is given. Let me plug in the numbers. ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, the problem wants the equation for the effective temperatures, and the options involve ln(2) equals some ratio of Ts.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

But I'm not sure if that helps. Wait, let's compute the right side.

k is Boltzmann's constant, about 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, that's interesting. So ΔE is equal to k (Boltzmann constant) times something. Let me compute ΔE/k:

ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

So ΔE = k * 1 K → ΔE/k = 1.

So the equation becomes:

(1) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2
