Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Hmm, let me read through it again.

Alright, the problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times bigger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So both radius and mass are scaled by 1.5 for Star_1 compared to Star_2.

Then, the problem mentions that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is related to its temperature. The formula is Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T_1 = T_2.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity is the component of a star's velocity along the observer's line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Wait, luminosity is intrinsic brightness, so maybe radial velocity doesn't directly affect it here. Or does it? Well, wait, no. Because luminosity is an absolute measure, as in how much energy the star emits per unit time. Radial velocity could affect observed quantities like brightness (apparent brightness, which is flux) because of Doppler shift, but here they're talking about luminosity, which is an intrinsic property. So maybe the radial velocities are a red herring here, unless they affect the observed wavelength in some other way. But wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity based on black body radiation. So perhaps the radial velocities don't directly affect the calculation of luminosity because luminosity depends on temperature, radius, and other intrinsic factors, not on how fast the star is moving towards or away from us.

Wait, let me think again. Luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since they're both black bodies, that formula applies.

So, the problem is asking by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2. So I need to compute L1 / L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2 (since peak wavelengths are same), let's plug into the formula.

So,

L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4
L2 = 4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4

Since T1 = T2, and R1 = 1.5 R2, then L1 / L2 = (R1²) / (R2²) ) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Wait, but the options have numbers around 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, 2.35. So 2.25 is option A. But wait, wait—did I miss something? Because in the problem, it says that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. But I thought that doesn't matter because luminosity is an intrinsic property. Unless the radial velocity affects the observed flux, but the problem is asking about the computed luminosity, which is based on their actual properties, not the observed flux.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem says that through spectroscopy, they found the peak wavelengths to be the same. But considering Doppler shift, if a star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity), its spectrum would be blueshifted, so the peak wavelength would be shorter than the rest wavelength. Conversely, if moving away, redshifted, longer wavelength.

Wait, but in the problem, Star_1 has radial velocity zero, while Star_2 has 700 km/s. So Star_2 is moving away, perhaps? Or towards? Wait, the radial velocity is given as 700 km/s. But the direction isn't specified—so maybe it's a blueshift or redshift. But the observed peak wavelength is the same as Star_1's. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but the actual emitted wavelengths (from their rest frames) might be different because of Doppler shift.

Wait, that's a possibility. So perhaps the observed lambda_max is the same, but their actual emitted lambda_max is different due to Doppler effect.

So, let's think again. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength would be blueshifted, meaning the emitted wavelength is longer (since when moving towards, light is blueshifted, so observed lambda is shorter than emitted). Wait no, wait: the Doppler effect for light. If a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, so observed wavelength is smaller than the rest wavelength. So if Star_2's rest frame has a longer lambda_max, but due to its motion towards us, the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1's.

Wait, but in the problem, the radial velocities are zero for Star_1 and 700 for Star_2. So Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s relative to us. But whether it's moving towards or away depends on the sign. Did the problem specify? Let me check. Oh, it just says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So maybe Star_2 has a radial velocity of +700, meaning moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer. But then, if Star_1's observed wavelength is the same as Star_2's observed, but Star_2 is moving away, then Star_2's emitted wavelength would be shorter than Star_1's. Because moving away would make the observed wavelength longer. So for Star_2, the observed lambda_max is same as Star_1's, which is at rest, so Star_2 must have a shorter emitted lambda_max (because when it moves away, the observed is longer).

Wait, but wait. Let me think in terms of formula. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) )

Assuming v_r is the radial velocity (v_r is positive when moving away). But wait, the exact formula can vary depending on approximation, but perhaps the relativistic Doppler effect is given by:

lambda_observed / lambda_emitted = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, v is the radial velocity. So if a star is moving away, v is positive, and the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So, in our case, for Star_2, the observed lambda is same as Star_1's. Let me denote:

lambda1_observed = lambda1_emitted (since Star_1's radial velocity is zero)
lambda2_observed = lambda1_observed (given)

So lambda2_observed = lambda2_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) )

Wait, but v_r2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute that in terms of c. Let's see, c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.002333c. So when v is much less than c, we can approximate the Doppler shift formula using a Taylor expansion. Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation lambda_observed ≈ lambda_emitted (1 + v_r / c) for small v/c.

But perhaps that's complicating things. Let me see. The problem is that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but the stars' actual temperatures may be different because of their velocities. Because the observed lambda_max is a combination of their intrinsic temperature and their velocity.

Wait, but earlier I thought that T1 = T2 because lambda_max was same. But if the observed lambda_max is same, but their actual emitted wavelengths are different due to Doppler, then their actual temperatures would be different. So perhaps I was wrong in the initial assumption that T1 = T2.

Wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.

Star_1's lambda_max is its emitted lambda_max because it's not moving (v=0). So lambda_max1 = b / T1.

Star_2's emitted lambda_max would be lambda_max2 = b / T2.

But due to Star_2's radial velocity, the observed lambda_max is lambda_obs2 = lambda_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

But according to the problem, lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2. Since Star_1 is at rest, lambda_obs1 = lambda_max1.

So,

lambda_max1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_max2 * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

But lambda_max1 = b / T1 and lambda_max2 = b / T2.

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

We can cancel b from both sides:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v_r2/c)/(1 - v_r2/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( [ (1 + v_r2/c) / (1 - v_r2/c) ] )

Wait, let me make sure. Let me rearrange:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * [ (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )^0.5 ]

So,

T2 = T1 * [ (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )^0.5 ]

But v is 700 km/s. Let me compute v/c:

700 / (3e5) = 7e2 / 3e5 = 0.0023333...

So v/c ≈ 0.002333.

So,

(1 + v/c) ≈ 1.002333
(1 - v/c) ≈ 0.997667

So their ratio is 1.002333 / 0.997667 ≈ approx 1.00467.

Taking the square root: sqrt(1.00467) ≈ approx 1.00233.

So,

T2 ≈ T1 * 1.00233.

So T2 is slightly larger than T1.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 = T2. But that was incorrect because the Doppler effect causes the observed wavelength to differ from the emitted. So now I have to consider that T2 is higher than T1.

Wait, but wait: if Star_2 is moving away (v_r2 positive), then its observed wavelength is longer (since it's redshifted). But the observed lambda for both stars are same, so Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter, which implies higher temperature since lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So if Star_2's observed lambda is same as Star_1's, but Star_2 is moving away, then Star_2's emitted lambda must be shorter (so higher T).

Wait, that makes sense. So Star_2's emitted lambda is shorter, so T2 is higher. So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

Which, as I calculated, is about T1 * 1.00233.

So now, when computing the luminosity ratio, I can't just assume T1 = T2. So L1 = 4π R1^2 σ T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4)

We know R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1^2 / R2^2 = (2.25).

T1 / T2 = 1 / (1.00233) ≈ 0.99767.

So (T1 / T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4 ≈ approx (approx 0.99767^2 is 0.99535, squared again is about 0.9907).

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ approximately 2.228.

So that's about 2.23, which is option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate the T2.

Wait, let me compute (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) more accurately.

v = 700 km/s.

c = 299,792 km/s. So v/c = 700 / 299792 ≈ 0.0023372.

So,

1 + v/c ≈ 1.0023372
1 - v/c ≈ 0.9976628

The ratio is 1.0023372 / 0.9976628 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute numerator: 1.0023372
Denominator: 0.9976628

So 1.0023372 / 0.9976628 ≈ let's compute:

Let me compute 1.0023372 / 0.9976628.

Let me approximate:

0.9976628 ≈ 1 - 0.0023372.

So, 1.0023372 ≈ 1 + 0.0023372.

So the ratio is (1 + a) / (1 - a) where a=0.0023372.

Which is approximately 1 + 2a, since (1+a)/(1-a) ≈ 1 + 2a for small a.

So 2a = 0.0046744.

So the ratio is about 1.0046744.

So the square root of 1.0046744 is approx 1.00233.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

We can write (1 + a)/(1 - a) = (1 + 2a + a²)/(1 - a²) but perhaps it's easier to compute the square root.

Let me compute sqrt(1.0046744).

We can write x = sqrt(1.0046744) = 1 + delta.

(1 + delta)^2 = 1 + 2 delta + delta^2 = 1.0046744.

Assuming delta is small, delta^2 is negligible.

So 2 delta ≈ 0.0046744 => delta ≈ 0.0023372.

So x ≈ 1.0023372.

Which makes T2 = T1 * x ≈ T1 * 1.0023372.

So T1 / T2 ≈ 1/1.0023372 ≈ 0.99767.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4.

Compute 0.99767^2:

0.99767 * 0.99767 ≈ (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 0.99534.

Then, square that again: (0.99534)^2 ≈ approx 0.99073.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.99073.

Thus, L1/L2 = (2.25) * (0.99073) ≈ 2.25 * 0.99073 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23. So the answer would be option D.

But wait, did I miss any other factors? Let me think: The problem says that the luminosity is computed based on black body radiation, so I think I accounted for all factors.

So the initial assumption that T1 = T2 was incorrect because of the Doppler shift affecting the observed lambda_max. So, the correct ratio is about 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \(R\) is the radius, \(T\) is the temperature, and \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \frac{T_1^4}{T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
From the problem, \(R_1 = 1.5 R_2\). Therefore:

\[
\frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{max, obs}}\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law, \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect. For Star_2, which has a radial velocity \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is redshifted. The relationship between the observed and emitted wavelengths is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emitted}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For Star_1, \(\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emitted, 1}}\) because its radial velocity is zero. For Star_2, \(\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emitted, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}\). Since the observed wavelengths are the same:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, emitted, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emitted, 2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

Using \(\lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T}\), the temperature ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

The speed of light \(c = 299,792 \, \text{km/s}\), so \(v_r/c = 700 / 299,792 \approx 0.0023372\). Substituting:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.0023372}{1 - 0.0023372}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.0023372}{0.9976628}} \approx \sqrt{1.0046744} \approx 1.00233
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx \frac{1}{1.00233} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \((0.99767)^2\):

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.99534
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
(0.99534)^2 \approx 0.99073
\]

Finally:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99073 \approx 2.228
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \(2.23\) times greater than that of Star_2.
