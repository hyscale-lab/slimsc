Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is 1.38e-23 J. The stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy states to temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations being equal to the exponential of negative delta E over (k*T), right? So, for two energy levels, the ratio n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. I think that means the number of atoms in the higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2. Or wait, maybe it's more about the excitation compared to each other. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2. So, if I denote the excitation as, say, the number of atoms in an excited state, n1 and n2 for the two stars, then n1 = 2 * n2. Or maybe it's the ratio n_upper / n_lower. Hmm.

But wait, the way the question is phrased: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So perhaps the excitation is a measure of the population in the higher energy level compared to the lower one, or compared to the total. Or maybe it's the ratio of the excited state population to something else.

Alternatively, maybe it's the ratio of the populations in the same energy level between the two stars. Like, n1 = 2 n2. But I'm not sure. Let's think again: the energy difference is given, so we probably need to use the Boltzmann factor.

Let me denote the ratio of the populations in the two stars. For each star, the ratio of populations in the same energy levels would be determined by their temperatures. But wait, the question is about the same energy levels in the two stars. Oh, wait, no. The energy difference is the same for both stars because it's the same iron atoms, so ΔE is the same for each star.

Wait, no, the energy difference is between the same two levels for both stars. So for star_1, the ratio of the upper to lower level is n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. I think this might mean that the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or something) is twice as high in star_1. Alternatively, maybe the populations of a specific energy level are in a certain ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio n1 / n2 (where n is the number of excited atoms in the same energy level) is 2. So n1 = 2 n2. But each star has their own temperature. Hmm, maybe the question is about the ratio of the upper level to the lower level in each star. So in star_1, the upper level population is twice that of star_2's upper level, but considering their respective lower levels as well.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of the populations in each star. Let me consider the ratio n_upper / n_lower for each. Let me call them R1 and R2. So R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

The question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So perhaps R1 = 2 * R2? Or maybe n_upper for star_1 is twice that of star_2, but in the same energy level. Wait, but each star's n_upper depends on their own T. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the excitation is the ratio of the number in the excited state to the total number. So for each star, excitation x is given by x = n_upper / (n_upper + n_lower). But I'm not sure if that's the approach.

Wait, the question states that the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So perhaps, x1 = 2 x2, where x is the excitation fraction. But without knowing the exact definition, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the upper to lower level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, that's a possibility. So let me write:

n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = R1

n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) = R2

If star_1's excitation is twice as much, perhaps R1 = 2 R2.

So then,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE)/(k T2)

Rearranging,

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, but I think I've made a mistake in the signs. Let me re-do that step.

Wait, the equation is:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, no, let's go step by step.

We have:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ) = 2

Taking the natural log of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, the question doesn't give the value of ΔE, except that it's 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is Boltzmann's constant, k. Oh! Because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So, ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem states the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So, substituting into the previous equation:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But ΔE/k is (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So,

1 * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2

Wait, that's not matching any of the options. Let's see the options again.

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which matches what we have. Because our equation is (T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2 → (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2). So that's exactly option D.

So looking at the options:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1*T2)

Yes, that's the equation we derived.

Wait, but I should double-check the initial assumption. I assumed that R1 = 2 R2, where R is the ratio of upper to lower populations.

Another approach: perhaps the excitation is the same, but star_1 has higher temperature, leading to more excitation. But the question says star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. So maybe the ratio of excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2.

Wait, another possibility: the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level.

But each star's number depends on their own temperature. So n1 = 2 n2.

But n_upper is proportional to g_upper exp(-E_upper/(k T)), and g_lower exp(-E_lower/(k T)). So the ratio for each star is R1 and R2 as before.

But if n1 = 2 n2, what does that mean? Not sure. Let's see.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the total number. So for each star, x = n_upper / (n_upper + n_lower).

If star_1's x is twice that of star_2, then x1 = 2 x2.

But that might complicate things, as I'd have to express x in terms of R. Because x = R/(1 + R), where R is the ratio n_upper/n_lower.

So if x1 = 2 x2,

R1/(1+R1) = 2 [ R2/(1+R2) ]

But without knowing more, this approach might not be as straightforward. Maybe the initial approach was correct.

So, I think option D is the correct equation.


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the value of the Boltzmann constant \( k \). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
R_2 = \frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2, which implies \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Dividing through by \( \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) \), we obtain:

\[
\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right) = 2.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \) (given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), this simplifies to:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches **Option D**, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
