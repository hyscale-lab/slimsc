Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex. The β values probably correspond to different complexes. Since the question mentions dithiocyanato, which I think refers to a complex with two SCN- ions, I need to figure out which β corresponds to that.

Wait, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+. So β1 might be for the first complex, maybe [CoSCN]+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or maybe the numbering is different. But the problem says "dithiocyanato," so that's two SCN- ions. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^something. Wait, I'm not sure about the charge. Let me think: Co(II) has a +2 charge, each SCN- is -1. So [Co(SCN)_2] would have a charge of +2 - 2*(1) = 0? No, wait: each SCN- contributes -1, so two of them would be -2. So +2 (from Co) minus 2 (from two SCN-) gives 0. So the complex is neutral. But I'm not entirely sure, but maybe the exact charge doesn't matter for calculating the percentage.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. Wait, but which β corresponds to that? Let me see:

Stability constant β is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So for each step:

Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = 9

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2] → β2 =40

[Co(SCN)_2] + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63

[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^{3-} → β4=16

Wait, but that would make β2 the formation of the dithiocyanato complex, i.e., [Co(SCN)_2]. So β2 is 40. But wait, the problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ complex, which is the first one. Or maybe another complex. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I might be mixing up different complexes. Let me think. I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- complex is usually blue, but wait, no, wait, the [Co(SCN)_6]^3- is a different case. Wait, no, maybe that's another metal. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue. I think the question states that the blue is the dithiocyanato complex, so [Co(SCN)_2]^+ would be that. So β1=9 would correspond to that formation.

Wait, but wait. The first complex is [CoSCN]^+ (monothiocyanato), β1=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2], which would have a β of β2=40. But the problem says the blue is the dithiocyanato, so that would be [Co(SCN)_2], which corresponds to β2=40. So perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, I might have to think about the overall formation constants. The overall β for the n-th complex is the product of the stepwise βs. So for [Co(SCN)_n], the overall β would be β1*β2*…*βn.

Wait, no, the stepwise βs are for each addition. So β1 is for the first SCN- addition, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, but the problem gives the β1, β2, β3, β4 as the stability constants for each complex. So maybe each β is the overall stability constant for that particular complex.

Wait, that's possible. So for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. For [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2=40. For [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, β3=63, and for [Co(SCN)_4]^4-, β4=16.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the β given is the cumulative or stepwise constant. Typically, βn is the cumulative constant, the overall formation from the ions. So the first complex's β is for the first step, and the second is for the second step, etc. So the overall β for each complex would be the product of the stepwise β's up to that point.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me clarify: the stepwise formation constant is K for adding each SCN- one at a time. So the first step: Co²+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^+ → K1=β1=9.

The second step: [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} → K2=β2=40.

Wait, but the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would be K1 * K2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Wait, but the problem gives each β as β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps each β is the cumulative constant, not the stepwise. Or maybe the problem says "stability constants of the complexes", which would typically mean the cumulative (overall) β.

So, the question is a bit ambiguous, but given that β1=9, β2=40, etc., probably each βi is the cumulative constant for the i-th complex. So [CoSCN]^+ has β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} has β2=40, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{4-} has β4=16.

Wait, but that can't be right because the fourth complex has a lower β than the third. That would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which might happen, but I'm not sure.

But regardless, the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which would be the second
