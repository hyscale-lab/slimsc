Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting, so that the researchers should prioritize observing it. Let's see what the given information is.

First, both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They were detected via the radial velocity method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1, and Planet_2's is P2 = 3 * P1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, so P1 = P2 / 3. So P1 is smaller. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right, because shorter orbital period usually means closer orbit.

Their host stars have the same radii, but different masses. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So higher mass, same radius. I remember that for stars, higher mass usually means larger radius, but in this case, both have same radii. Maybe they're on different parts of the main sequence or something. But for this problem, the star's radius is the same for both.

Now, transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star, and the inclination of the orbit. The probability is higher when the planet's orbit is edge-on, but I think the probability is the chance that the orbital plane is aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective. 

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula: (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, that's the probability that a randomly oriented orbit will transit. Wait, no, actually, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle. Or wait, I think the formula is (R_star / a), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)). But since Earth-like planets are much smaller than stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the probability simplifies to (R_star) / (a) multiplied by (1 + 0), so just R_star / a. Wait, maybe
