Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read through the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in some kind of elimination reaction, maybe a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the reaction to convert alcohols to alkyl halides. Oh wait, wait. Oh right! When an alcohol reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's usually a substitution reaction. But wait, no, another thought. Red phosphorus is used in the presence of iodide to make alkyl iodides from alcohols. So if the starting material is an alcohol, this reaction would produce an alkyl iodide. But maybe that's a tangent here. Let me think about the data given.

The IR data is: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1. The broad region between 3400 and 2500 suggests maybe an -OH group, but wait, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the -OH would be gone. But looking at the options, some are acids. Oh, wait but let me think about the IR first.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong absorption, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, a carboxylic acid usually has a broad, strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1. The IR here has a region from 3400–2500, which is a broad area. Also, looking at the 1H NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very deshielded. That's characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton. So that would suggest that Compound X is a carboxylic acid. But wait, if X is a carboxylic acid, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI? That's a bit confusing because I thought red phosphorus is used for alcohols. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is for an ester or something else.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe the reaction is a substitution on an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Let me think. Red phosphorus with HI is sometimes used in the hydrolysis of esters. Oh, but wait, no, more commonly, HI and red phosphorus are used for the dehydrohalogenation (but that's elimination) or for substitution. Wait, maybe it's a substitution where the leaving group is replaced. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a nitro compound and HI is acting as a reducing agent, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data to figure out what Compound X is. Let's go through the NMR.

The 1H NMR has the following peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, likely the -COOH proton.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet, probably aromatic and part of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, probably the other two aromatic protons, para to the substituents.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for 1H, perhaps a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, like a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, maybe a CH2 next to a CH or something.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H, likely a methyl group attached to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, probably a terminal CH3, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, the aromatic part suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, let's imagine a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a COOH group (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and the other substituent is something else. Looking at the other peaks, there's a CH adjacent to a carbonyl (the 2.9 ppm peak), which could be a CH connected to both the benzene ring and a carbonyl. Then, perhaps a chain proceeding from there.

Wait, let me try to imagine the structure. So, benzene ring with substituents at para positions. One substituent is -COOH. The other substituent is a group that looks like -CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2 or something? Wait, the NMR peaks for the non-aromatic parts: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). Let's see: the 0.9 triplet suggests a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 doublet of 3H suggests a CH(CH3), perhaps. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be CH2 groups. Oh, putting it together, maybe it's a butyl group? Let me think.

The 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which is typical for a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which is a methyl group attached to a CH (like in an isobutyl group). The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for two protons, perhaps a CH2 adjacent to a CH. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for one proton, perhaps connected to the carbonyl group.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH that's adjacent to a carbonyl. So perhaps the structure is something like benzene with a COOH group and a (CH2)2CH(CH2CH3) group? Hmm, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene with a COOH and a CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2... Wait, maybe it's a propanoic acid substituent. Wait, if it's a benzoic acid derivative, with a substituent on the ring attached to a chain.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. So, the substituent on the benzene would be a group R, which is connected to the ring, and R is a chain leading to a carbonyl. Let's see, the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH adjacent to the carbonyl. So, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)n-COOH. But wait, the substituent is on the benzene. So, perhaps the structure is para-substituted, with one substituent being -COOH, and the other substituent being a chain that leads to a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't have a peak for an aldehyde proton, so it's not an aldehyde. The 1720 cm-1 in IR could be a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the presence of the broad peak at ~10 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a substituent that is a chain ending in a carbonyl group, but that doesn't make sense because the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a ketone or ester.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a CH2COOH group. But then I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a chain leading to a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think again.

Looking at the substituents:

The aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating 2H. So, the substituents are in the para positions. One is a -COOH group, as indicated by the 10.5 ppm peak. The other substituent is presumably a group that leads to the other NMR signals.

The other signals: 2.9 ppm (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), and 0.9 (3H, t). Let's see, the 0.9 ppm triplet is probably a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet is likely a methyl group attached to a CH. So if we have a CH2CH3 group, and a CH with a methyl, perhaps it's a butyl group.

Wait, let's try to construct the substituent. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. If that's a CH2 group next to another CH2, then perhaps the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. But the 2.9 ppm is a CH group. So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Wait, but that would give a longer chain.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene is a group like -(CH2)2CH(CH2CH3), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group attached to a CH(CH3) or something. Let me think about the integration. The substituent on the benzene is connected to a carbon chain. The chain might be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)1-CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the ring, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)2, but that would have different NMR signals.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the NMR signals:

- The 10.5 ppm is a COOH proton.
- The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are two doublets each integrating 2H. So the benzene has two substituents in the para positions. One is COOH, the other is a group that has a chain leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group. Because the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which could be a ketone, but the NMR doesn't show a ketone proton. Wait, but for a ketone, the carbonyl is at around 170-175 cm-1, so that's consistent. If the substituent is a propionyl group, then the structure would be benzene with a COOH and a (CH2)2CO something.

Wait, but the substituent would be something like -(CH2)2-CO-R. Hmm, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, let's think about the substituent. The substituent R on the benzene is a group that has a CH group, which appears at 2.9 ppm. That CH is probably attached to a carbonyl, so it would be a ketone. So if R is -(CH2)2-C(O)-something. Alternatively, it might be a secondary alcohol, but then the IR would have a broad O-H stretch as well.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me see.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene is probably a propyl group with a branching. The NMR shows that substituent has a CH group (2.9 ppm), then a CH2 (1.7 ppm), a CH(CH3) (1.4 ppm), and a CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm). So perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH? Or maybe it's a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-COOH? Wait, but that would be longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group. Let me think. The substituent on the benzene is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. Or perhaps something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group but with a branching. For example, a isobutyl group attached to the benzene. Wait, but the substituent would be attached to the ring, and then have a chain leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group. That would give the substituent as -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH.

Wait, but then the NMR would have a triplet at 0.9 ppm (from the CH2CH3), a doublet at 1.4 ppm (the CH(CH3)), and a multiplet at 1.7 and 2.9 ppm (the adjacent CH2 and CH groups). That might fit.

So, the substituent would be a propyl group attached to the ring, with a branching. So the structure would be para-substituted benzene with COOH and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but then the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which would correspond to a carbonyl, which in this case would be the COOH group. But COOH has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, so that's possible. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are probably from aromatic C=C stretches.

So, putting it all together, the structure is benzene with a COOH group in one para position and a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group in the other para position.

Wait, but that would mean the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's a three-carbon chain, but the NMR doesn't quite add up. Let me recount the substituent's structure.

The substituent R on the benzene is:

R = -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH.

Wait, but that would make the benzene ring have a substituent which is a propionic acid group. So the structure would be 4-(2-ethylpropionyloxy)benzoic acid? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 3-pentyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should try to draw the structure based on the NMR data.

Looking at the substituent's NMR peaks:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl (CH3) group attached to a CH.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl.

Putting this together, the substituent is likely a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the substituent on the benzene is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group.

Wait, but that would mean the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)COOH. So, the substituent is a propionic acid with a branching. Hmm, but the IR has a 1720 cm-1, which would be the carbonyl of the acid.

But another thought: Maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH group, making the substituent -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. So, the benzene would have a para substituent that's a propionic acid with an ethyl branch.

But wait, that would make the substituent a 3-ethylpropionic acid group. That seems a bit complicated, but perhaps that's the case.

But wait, the substituent is on the benzene ring, so perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position. That would fit if the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

But wait, let's think about the structure of sec-butyl. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait no. Wait, the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the structure is (CH2)2CHCH2? Wait, no, the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, the butyl group has four carbons. The sec-butyl group is where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that would be a pentyl group. Let me think again.

Wait, butyl groups: The four carbons. The primary butyl is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-. The secondary (sec) butyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, let me count. For a sec-butyl group, it's a four-carbon chain where the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that would be a three-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, that's a tertiary butyl group. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The correct structure for a
