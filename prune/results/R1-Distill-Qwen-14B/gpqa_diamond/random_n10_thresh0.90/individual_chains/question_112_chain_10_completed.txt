Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's start by understanding the question properly. 

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities are involved. The normalization factor will make sure that the sum of the probabilities is 1.

Wait, the state is proportional, so I should find the normalization constant. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the normalization is just the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients' magnitudes.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me calculate their magnitudes squared. 

For (1+i), the magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
For (2 - i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. 

So adding them together, 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, the problem mentions an operator with a matrix representation A_ij. It says A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j, 0 otherwise. Wait, so for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2.

Wait, let me think. The matrix would look like:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is:
[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2 0 ]

Hmm, this operator is probably the spin in the x-direction, but I'm not entirely sure. Because the standard spin-x operator is (hbar/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], which matches this structure.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the spin-x component.

But wait, the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So the problem is asking for the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Then, the probabilities would be the squared magnitudes of the coefficients.

Alternatively, another approach: since the operator A is given, perhaps we can find its eigenstates and express |alpha> in that basis, then find the probabilities.

Wait, let me think. The operator A is represented by the matrix:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

The eigenvalues of this matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation. The trace is zero, and the determinant is -(hbar/2)^2. So the eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 + (hbar/2)^2 = 0. So λ = ±i hbar/2. Hmm, but that's a bit strange because eigenvalues for an observable should be real. Oh wait, this can't be right. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, the operator in question must be a Hermitian operator because it's an observable. Wait, let me check: the matrix A given is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2,0]], which is symmetric (Hermitian if elements are real), which is the case here. So the eigenvalues should be real. Wait, but when I calculated the trace and determinant, I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the trace is 0, determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = - (hbar^2)/(4). So the characteristic equation is λ^2 - (trace) λ + determinant = 0 → λ² - 0 + (-hbar²/4) = 0 → λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2. Oh, right! I must have made a mistake earlier. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, which are real, as expected.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = hbar/2, λ_- = -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenstates can be found. Let's find the eigenvectors.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0 → [[ -hbar/2 , hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]] * [v1, v2]^T = 0.

The equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, 1]^T. But we can normalize it. The state is (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + hbar/2 I) v =0 → [[ hbar/2, hbar/2 ], [hbar/2, hbar/2 ]] * [v1, v2]^T=0.

The equations are:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 + v2=0 → v2= -v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, -1]^T. The normalized state is (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Now, the state |alpha> is given, and we need to express it in terms of these eigenstates to find the probabilities.

So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Let me write this as |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

We need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

We can write:

|alpha> = c |+x> + d |−x>,

where c is the amplitude for |+x>, which is the inner product < +x | alpha >.

Similarly, d is < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute c and d.

Compute c = < +x | alpha >.

|+x> = (|up> + |down> )/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] ( a |up> + b |down> )

= (1/sqrt(2)) ( a <up|up> + a <up|down> + b <down|up> + b <down|down> )

But <up|down> = 0, <down|up> =0.

So it's (1/sqrt(2)) ( a + b ).

Similarly, compute d = < -x | alpha >.

|−x> = (|up> − |down> )/sqrt(2).

So <−x | alpha> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| − <down| ] (a |up> + b |down> )

= (1/sqrt(2)) ( a <up|up> - a <up|down> + b <down|up> - b <down|down> )

Again, cross terms are zero, so it's (1/sqrt(2)) (a - b).

So c = (a + b)/sqrt(2), d = (a - b)/sqrt(2).

Compute a + b and a − b.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

a + b = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) = (3 + 0i)/sqrt(7) → 3/sqrt(7).

a − b = (1+i − (2 - i)) / sqrt(7) = [ (1−2) + (i + i) ] / sqrt(7) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7).

So c = (3/sqrt(7)) / sqrt(2) ) → 3/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)) → 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, d = ( (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(7) ) / sqrt(2) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c|^2 and |d|^2.

Compute |c|²:

c = 3 / sqrt(14) → |c|² = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, |d|².

d = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate it properly.

d is ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14). So |d|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 → that's close.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 → no.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46 → no.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → no.

So the probabilities are approximately 9/14 ≈ 0.6429, and 5/14≈0.357.

So the first part of the problem is to find the probabilities, which are about 9/14 and 5/14, or 0.64 and 0.36. That matches option A.

But wait, the question also asks for the average value of the operator. So I need to compute the expectation value of A.

The expectation value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is given as a matrix, perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

But wait, another approach: since A has eigenvalues λ_+ and λ_-, the expectation value is the sum of probabilities times the eigenvalues.

So <A> = P_+ * (hbar/2) + P_- * (-hbar/2) ), where P_+ is |c|^2 and P_- is |d|^2.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) ) = [ (9 -5)hbar ]/(2*14) ) → (4 hbar)/(28) → hbar/(7).

So the average value is hbar/7.

Wait, but wait, let me check.

Alternatively, compute <A> using the state |alpha>:

|alpha> is (a |up> + b |down> ), where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2-i)/sqrt(7).

The operator A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

So <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute this as:

<up| A |up> =0, <up|A |down> = hbar/2, similarly <down|A |up> = hbar/2, <down|A |down> =0.

So:

<alpha| A |alpha> = |a|^2 * 0 + a^* b (hbar/2) + b^* a (hbar/2) + |b|^2 *0.

Which is (a^* b + b^* a ) * hbar/2.

Compute a^* and b^*.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a^* = (1-i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), so b^* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

Now, a^* b = (1-i)(2 -i) / (7) → [ (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) ] = (2 -i -2i + i²) → i² is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Wait, let me compute (1 - i)(2 - i):

Multiply: 1*2 = 2, 1*(-i) = -i, (-i)*2 = -2i, (-i)*(-i) = i² = -1.

So 2 - i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) = 1 - 3i.

So a^* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Similarly, b^* a is (2 +i)(1 +i)/7.

Compute (2+i)(1+i) = 2*1 + 2i +i*1 + i*i → 2 + 2i +i + (-1) → (2-1) + (3i) = 1 +3i.

So b^* a = (1 +3i)/7.

So a^*b + b^*a = [ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

Thus, <A> = (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= (2/7)(hbar/2) )= hbar/(7).

So yes, the average value is hbar/7.

So looking back at the options, option A says the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and average is hbar/7, which matches.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by the magnitudes of the coefficients. The magnitudes squared are \( |1+i|^2 = 2 \) and \( |2-i|^2 = 5 \), so the total is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Next, the operator \( A \) is given with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( \lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), with corresponding eigenstates \( |+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle) \) and \( |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle) \).

To find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of \( A \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \). The coefficients are:

\[
c = \langle +x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
d = \langle -x|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad |d|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

Finally, the average value of \( A \) is calculated as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha|A|\alpha\rangle = |c|^2 \lambda_+ + |d|^2 \lambda_- = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \hbar / 7 \).**
