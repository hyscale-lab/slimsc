Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is saying.

So, there's this star with a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The question is about how the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is given by the Boltzmann factor: (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy of each level. Alternatively, sometimes it's (n1/n2) depending on how it's written.

Wait, in the question, they're looking at the ratio when the surface isn't covered (normal state) versus when it is (with spots). So, they observe that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of level 1 to level 2, right? Because the ratio decreases when there are spots.

Wait, let me read the question again: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)" decreases when the star has spots. So, it's (n1/n2) that decreases. Or perhaps (n2/n1) increases?

Wait, if the ratio (n1/n2) is decreasing, that implies that (n2/n1) is increasing, meaning more atoms in higher energy levels. But higher energy levels would be more populated when the temperature is higher. Wait, but when the star has spots, the overall temperature of the photosphere is lower. So why would higher energy levels be more populated?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The star without spots has Teff = 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, and the overall Teff is 5500 K. Wait, but wait, spots are cooler, so the effective temperature of the entire star is lower. So the average temperature of the photosphere is lower when spots are present.

But wait, the photosphere is the star's outer layer. If the spots are cooler regions, but the rest is hotter? No, that's probably not right. I think when spots are present, the star's total emitted flux is lower because the spots are darker. But the Teff is an average—so the photosphere's effective temperature drops.

So, the problem is that the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler overall.

Now, the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. Let's imagine that the transition between these levels emits at 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or UV. So, the energy difference between the levels is ΔE = hc/λ. Let's
