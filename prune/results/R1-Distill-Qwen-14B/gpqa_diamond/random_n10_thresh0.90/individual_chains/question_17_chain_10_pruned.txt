Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and they've given some data like the concentration of the complex, the temperature, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA. 

Hmm, wait, let me make sure I remember what each of these terms means. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is a complex ion formed between calcium ions and EDTA. EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions pretty tightly. The concentration given is 0.02 M for the complex, which I think is the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex itself.

The problem states that the pH is ideal. I remember that pH affects the availability of EDTA because EDTA has different protonation states depending on the pH. But since the pH is ideal, maybe I don't have to worry about that here. Oh, and the temperature is 25°C, but I don't think the temperature comes into play in this particular calculation, since K is given at that temperature.

The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Formation constants (Kf) are the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The Kf is the product of the concentrations of the products over the reactants, so Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but in this case, we have the complex concentration, which is 0.02 M. So, assuming that all the EDTA is tied up in the complex, because EDTA is in excess? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think again. If the solution is stochiometric, that might mean that the molar amounts of Ca²+ and EDTA are equal, so the complex forms 1:1. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, which comes from the reaction between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, the question is asking about the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. If the complex is formed, then the free calcium ions would be very low because the Kf is very large (5e10 is a big number, so the reaction favors the product). So the complex is almost completely formed, and the free Ca²+ concentration would be very small.

So, the setup is: initial concentrations. Let me denote [CaEDTA^2−] as 0.02 M. But wait, if the solution is just the complex, then the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be zero except what's contributed by the dissociation of the complex. So, considering the dissociation:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant, right? Because Kf is for the formation, so Kd (dissociation) is 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So, the dissociation equation is:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA^2−] 

We can set up an ICE table. Let me let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Since the complex is 0.02 M, the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and when it dissociates, it produces x of Ca²+ and x of EDTA^4−. So, at equilibrium:

[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small because Kd is so small)

So, Kd = x * x / 0.02 = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Therefore, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Let me compute it numerically. sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? No, wait, 2e-6.5 is 2/(1e6.5)= 2/(3.16e6)≈6e-7. Wait, no, 1e-6 is 0.000001, 1e-7 is 0.0000001. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, because 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7
