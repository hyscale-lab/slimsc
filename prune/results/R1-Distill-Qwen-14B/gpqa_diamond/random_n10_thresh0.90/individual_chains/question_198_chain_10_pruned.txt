Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. They give me the stability constants (β) for the different complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, wait, what's the structure here? I remember that stability constants are for complex ions. So for a metal ion like Co(II), it can form complexes with SCN- in different stoichiometries. The β values are the formation constants, right? So each β corresponds to a different complex.

So the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^2-n. Let me think: for each n, the β is given. So β1 is for the first complex, maybe CoSCN^+, β2 is Co(SCN)2^0, β3 Co(SCN)3^-2, and β4 Co(SCN)4^-3? Or wait, maybe the charges are different. Let me think about each step.

Each β corresponds to adding one SCN- to the complex. So the general form is Co(L)_n, where L is SCN-.

So the first complex, n=1: Co(SCN)^+2 (since Co is +2, SCN- is -1 each, so 1 SCN gives Co(SCN) → Co^2+ + SCN^- → charge is 2+ -1 = +1. So the complex is [Co(SCN)]^+.

Wait, no: Co^2+ will combine with SCN^- to form a complex. The first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1 is the formation constant for this.

Each subsequent β is for adding another SCN-.

So the complexes are:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+, β1=9
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, β3=63
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^-3, β4=16.

Wait, but sometimes stability constants are given for each step, so maybe β1 is the first step, β2 is the second, etc. So the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point.

Wait, no. Wait, in terms of formation constants, each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth step. So for the second complex, the overall β would be β1 * β2, right? Because the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ (β1), and the second step is [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (β2). So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is β1 * β2 = 9*40=360.

Similarly for higher complexes, the overall β is the product of β1 through βn.

So the problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, what's the blue one? I recall that [Co(SCN)_4]^-3 is the blue complex, known as the cobalt thiocyanate complex. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is a different color. But the question says "blue dithiocyanato," which would imply two SCN groups. Wait, no, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per complex. So perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because "di" implies two.

Wait, but the options are about the percentage of the blue complex. The problem says the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. So I'm trying to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, no, wait. Maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? Because I remember that the cobalt thiocyanate complexes are often blue when they have four SCN- ligands. Like, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue. So the question is about that. But the question says "dithiocyanato"—which is two SCN- groups. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I got the term wrong. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the dithiocyanato complex. But then, why is it blue? Alternatively, maybe the blue is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous, but given the term "dithiocyanato", I think it refers to two SCN- groups. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So I need to find the fraction of this species.

Wait, but the options are given, perhaps I can proceed without knowing exactly which complex is which.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible cobalt species in solution, given the ligand concentration and stability constants.

The total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. The [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

The possible species are the free Co^2+ ion and the complexes [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-2, [Co(SCN)_4]^-3.

But wait, the formation of each complex depends on the available SCN^- concentration.

The fraction of each species can be found using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

I think the problem here is to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So let's think about the general approach.

The fraction of each complex can be determined using the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The general approach for multiple complex equilibria is to consider all possible complexes and their contributions.

Each complex can be formed stepwise, and the formation constants are given for each step.

The fraction of each complex is determined by the product of the formation constants up to that step, multiplied by the ligand concentration raised to the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all possible species' contributions.

Wait, let me think again.

The formation constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4, each corresponding to adding an SCN- to the complex.

So the formation constants for each complex are:

β1 = [ [CoSCN^+] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) = 9

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2^0] ] / ( [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] ) = 40

β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3^-2] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_2^0][SCN^-] ) = 63

β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4^-3] ] / ( [Co(SCN)_3^-2][SCN^-] ) = 16.

So the overall formation constants (β_total) for each complex are:

β1 = 9

β1*β2 = 9*40=360 → for [Co(SCN)_2]^0

β1*β2*β3=360*63=22680 → for [Co(SCN)_3]^-2

β1*β2*β3*β4=22680*16=362880 → for [Co(SCN)_4]^-3

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right way. Because each β is the stepwise formation constant, so the overall β for each complex is the product of β1 to βn for that complex.

So, for [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), the overall β is β1*β2*...*βn.

So to find the fraction of each species, we can model the distribution of Co species.

The general approach is to consider the distribution based on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

The fraction of each complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / ( 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no. Let's think about the general expression.

The fraction of each species is given by the sum over all possible complexes.

The distribution can be modeled as:

f = ( [Co^2+] ) + ( [CoSCN^+] ) + ( [Co(SCN)_2^0] ) + ( [Co(SCN)_3^-2] ) + ( [Co(SCN)_4^-3] )

Each of these terms can be expressed in terms of the overall formation constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the fraction of each species.

The fraction of the nth complex is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / ( 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

So in this case, for each n (n=0,1,2,3,4), f_n is the fraction of the nth complex.

Wait, but wait, for n=0, it's just the free Co^2+.

So for n=0: f_0 = 1 / denominator.

n=1: [CoSCN^+] → f1 = β1 [SCN^-] / denominator.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → f2 = β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 / denominator.

Similarly, f3 = β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 / denominator.

f4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 / denominator.

Denominator is the sum of 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4.

So our denominator D is given by:

D = 1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4.

We need to compute each term.

Given that β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

And [SCN^-]=0.1 M.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1 → 1.

Term1: β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

Term2: β1 β2 * [SCN]^2 = 9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

Term3: β1 β2 β3 * [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

Calculate 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

(0.1)^3 = 0.001. So 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term4: β1 β2 β3 β4 * [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Calculate 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362,880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So the denominator D is:

D = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288.

Let me add them up.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 3.6 = 5.5

5.5 + 22.68 = 28.18

28.18 + 36.288 = 64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction of each complex is:

f0 = 1 / 64.468 ≈ 0.015519 → about 1.55%.

f1 = (0.9) / 64.468 ≈ 0.01396 → about 1.396%.

f2 = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05556 → about 5.556%.

f3 = 22.68 / 64.468 ≈ 0.3518 → about 35.18%.

f4 = 36.288 / 64.468 ≈ 0.5629 → about 56.29%.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So I need to know which complex that is.

Wait, dithiocyanato implies two SCN- groups, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's n=2, so f2 is 5.556%.

But wait, the options don't have anything near 5.5%. The options are A) 42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the β values are given as the overall formation constants, not the stepwise ones. Did I misinterpret the β values?

Because the way the problem states the "stability constants" could imply that each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex, not stepwise.

Wait, the question says: "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants (formation constants) are usually expressed as the overall constant for the complex. So [Co(SCN)]^+ would have β1=9, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has β2=40, and so on.

Wait, that would change things. Because if β2 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then the calculation is different.

So, if each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex, then:

β1 = [ [CoSCN^+] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) = 9.

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2^0] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 ) = 40.

β3 = [ [Co(SCN)_3^-2] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 ) = 63.

β4 = [ [Co(SCN)_4^-3] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-
