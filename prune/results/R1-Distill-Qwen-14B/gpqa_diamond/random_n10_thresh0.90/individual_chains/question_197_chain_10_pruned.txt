Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a try. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically involved in some kind of reaction, maybe a substitution or elimination. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydroxy-iodide reaction, like in the formation of the P=O group? Or wait, no, wait. Oh right! I think when you have an alkyne and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to do a hydration or maybe a substitution. Oh wait, no, wait. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Hmm.

Wait, no. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroxy iodide reaction, which is a way to convert alkynes into ketones. Oh wait, or wait, that's when you use HgSO4 and H2SO4, the oxymercuration. No, the hydroxy iodide method is different. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where an alkyne is converted into an iodide.

Alternatively, wait, maybe I should think about the initial compound's structure. The question gives IR and NMR data for Compound X, so I need to figure out what X is first, and then think about what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let me look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But looking at the options, the products don't have amines, so maybe it's an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Also, there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is around where C=C stretching occurs, so maybe it's an aromatic ring. And 1450 cm-1 is another region that might be C-O stretching, maybe in an ester or something else.

Then the NMR data. Let's go through it step by step.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Or maybe an aromatic -OH? But no, carboxylic acids are broad, but aromatic protons are usually around 7 ppm. So a singlet at 10.5 is probably a carbonyl proton, but wait, 10.5 is also where you see carboxylic acid protons. But wait, in NMR, a carboxylic acid proton is usually a broad peak, and here it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but they are also usually a triplet or something else because of coupling with adjacent protons. But this is a singlet, so maybe it's a
