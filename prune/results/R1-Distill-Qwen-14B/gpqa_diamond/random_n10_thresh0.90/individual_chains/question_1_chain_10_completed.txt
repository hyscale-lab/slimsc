Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I remember that the energy difference between states relates to the lifetime through the uncertainty principle. Let me think.

The question says two quantum states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Wait, wait, I think the lifetimes here refer to the time each state exists before decaying or something. Oh right, the uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (ΔE) and the time uncertainty (Δt) is on the order of ħ (hbar), the reduced Planck constant.

So the formula should be ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. Here, Δt would be the lifetime of the state, right? Because each state has a certain lifetime before it changes, so the uncertainty in time is about that lifetime.

The lifetimes are different for the two states. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Oh wait, no, the question is about the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished. So we're looking for the energy difference ΔE between the two states.

Wait no, the energy difference is E2 - E1, but the question is about what ΔE (the energy difference) is so that the states can be resolved. But how does the lifetime tie into that?

I remember that the broader the energy width (ΔE), the shorter the lifetime. Because if a state has a very short lifetime, its energy is less well-defined. So for two states to be distinguishable, their energy differences should be larger than the uncertainty introduced by their lifetimes.

Wait, maybe another angle: the resolution in energy measurements. To distinguish two energy levels, the energy difference between them should be greater than the uncertainty in energy, which is ħ divided by the lifetime. So the minimum ΔE for them to be resolved is about ħ / Δt.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime.

Wait, but in this problem, there are two different lifetimes. Hmm, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. Oh wait, perhaps each state has its own lifetime, but the energy difference between the two is what matters for resolution.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute the uncertainty for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't tell them apart.

Wait, no, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Because each state's uncertainty is the energy spread due to its own lifetime.

Wait, let me think again. Each state has an uncertainty ΔE_i = ħ / τ_i. So for the two states, ΔE1 = ħ/(1e-9), ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8).

Wait, but if the actual energy difference between E2 and E1 is much larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, then the two states are clearly resolvable.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties. Or perhaps each energy must be well separated relative to their own uncertainties.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me approach it step by step.

The time-energy uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So the uncertainty in energy for each state is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime. So for E1, which has a lifetime of 1e-9 sec, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(1e-8).

But wait, ħ is approximately 1e-34 J·s. Converting that to eV·s: since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so ħ ≈ 1e-34 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.25e-16 eV·s.

So for E1: ΔE1 ≈ 6.25e-16 eV·s / 1e-9 s = 6.25e-7 eV.

E2 has a lifetime of 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 = 6.25e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.25e-8 eV.

Wait, that's interesting. So the energy uncertainties for each state are 6.25e-7 eV and 6.25e-8 eV.

Now, for the two energy levels E1 and E2 to be clearly distinguishable, the difference between E2 and E1 should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each, perhaps? Or maybe the difference should be larger than each uncertainty individually.

Wait, but wait, the uncertainty in the energy difference would be the combination of the uncertainties in E1 and E2. So the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be sqrt(ΔE1² + ΔE2²), but maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, if we're trying to resolve two energy levels, E1 and E2, the minimum energy difference ΔE needed is such that ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2. Because if the actual energy difference is more than the sum of uncertainties, then they can be distinguished.

So let me compute that sum. ΔE1 is 6.25e-7 eV, ΔE2 is 6.25e-8 eV. Adding them together gives 6.875e-7 eV.

But the options given are:

A) 1e-9 eV
B) 1e-11 eV
C) 1e-4 eV
D) 1e-8 eV

Looking at these, option C is 1e-4 eV which is much larger than 6.875e-7 eV. So that would satisfy ΔE > sum of uncertainties.

But wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 6.25e-7 eV is 0.000000625 eV. 1e-4 eV is 0.0001 eV, which is way larger.

So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much bigger than the sum of uncertainties, then yes, the two states can be resolved.

Alternatively, perhaps even 1e-4 eV is way larger than each individual uncertainty. Let's see:

ΔE1 is 6.25e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.25e-8 eV. So the energy difference must be bigger than the larger of the two uncertainties. Since 6.25e-7 is bigger than 6.25e-8, the energy difference should be bigger than 6.25e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 6.25e-7. So that's way above. The question is, do any of the options satisfy this?

Other options are:
A) 1e-9 eV: 0.000000001 eV. That's way smaller than 6.25e-7, so no.
B) 1e-11 eV: even smaller.
D)1e-8 eV: 0.00000001 eV, still smaller than 6.25e-7.

So the only option that's larger than the larger uncertainty is option C, so the answer should be C.

But wait, another thought. The uncertainty principle gives the minimum ΔE. So if the actual ΔE is larger than the uncertainty, then it can be resolved.

So perhaps the correct approach is to compute the minimum ΔE required, which is the larger of the two uncertainties. Because both states have their own energy spreads. So the minimum energy difference to resolve them should be when ΔE is greater than the sum of the uncertainties.

Wait, but when you have two states, each with their own uncertainties, the combined uncertainty in their energy difference would be the root sum square of their individual uncertainties. But maybe for simplicity, they consider the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties.

Wait, in the problem, they are asking which option could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.

So the energy difference (ΔE) must be larger than the uncertainty in each state. So for E1, ΔE must be larger than ΔE1, and for E2, larger than ΔE2.

But since E1 has a larger uncertainty (6.25e-7 eV) than E2 (6.25e-8), the critical point is that ΔE must be larger than 6.25e-7 eV.

So the options: only option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4=0.0001, which is 1e-4 eV is much larger than 6.25e-7 eV. So yes, option C is the correct choice.

So the answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with lifetimes \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \) and \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \) that allows them to be clearly resolved, we use the time-energy uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar,
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (equal to the lifetime of the state), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant. Converting \( \hbar \) to electron volts-seconds (\( \hbar \approx 6.25 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)), the energy uncertainties for the two states are:

\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{6.25 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-9}} = 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV},
\]
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{6.25 \times 10^{-16}}{10^{-8}} = 6.25 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) between them must be greater than the larger of the two uncertainties, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **Option A (\( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.
- **Option B (\( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is also smaller than \( 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.
- **Option C (\( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is much larger than \( 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states can be resolved.
- **Option D (\( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \))**: This is smaller than \( 6.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so the states cannot be resolved.

Thus, the only option that satisfies the condition for the energy difference to clearly resolve the two states is **Option C**.
