Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question is about which stars can be observed by both. The key points are their apparent magnitudes because the brightness of the star determines if the instruments can detect them.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude has to be brighter than 17, since HIRES is brighter (so more restrictive? Wait no, because if a star is brighter than 16, it's certainly brighter than 17. So, wait, the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO is fainter (higher number) than HIRES. So, for a star to be observed by both, it must be brighter than 17 mag? Because HIRES can observe down to 16, but ESPRESSO can only go as bright as 17. Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Oh wait, the wording is a bit tricky. So, if a star's apparent V is brighter than 17, then ESPRESSO can see it. But if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can see it. So, for a star to be observed by both, it must be brighter than 17 mag. Because if it's brighter than 17, it's also brighter than 16. So, only stars with V magnitude <17 (brighter than 17) can be detected by both.

Wait, no: the magnitude system is such that lower values mean brighter. So, a magnitude of 16 is brighter than 17. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag (apparent V), ESPRESSO can detect it. But HIRES can detect stars brighter than 16 mag. So, stars that are brighter than 17 mag would be visible to both
