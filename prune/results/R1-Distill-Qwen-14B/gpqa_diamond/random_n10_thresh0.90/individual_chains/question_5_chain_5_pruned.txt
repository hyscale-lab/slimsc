Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, P_z. Oh right, I remember that when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction, you can express it as a combination of the standard basis components. Since the direction n is in the x-z plane, that means the direction has components in x and z, but no y component. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) because it's in the x-z plane. Or wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Hmm, I need to get that right. Oh, right, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So x is cosθ, z is sinθ? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If θ is the angle from the z-axis, then in spherical coordinates, x = r sinθ cosφ, y = r sinθ sinφ, z = r cosθ. But since φ is zero here because it's in the x-z plane, so y component is zero. So direction n would be (sinθ * cos0, 0, cosθ) = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, that doesn't make sense because when θ is zero, you should be along z. Oh wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Let me visualize: if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then when θ=0, the point is at (0,0,1), which is the positive z-axis. So the x component would be sinθ * cosφ. Since φ is 0 in this case, because direction is in x-z plane, then x is sinθ * 1 = sinθ. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P along n is P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

So the operator P is given in each component as:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P along direction n is P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Let me compute this matrix. Let me factor out ħ/2.

So P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives:

[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives:

[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them together:

First row: [cosθ, sinθ]
Second row: [sinθ, -cosθ]

So the matrix becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

We are looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Substituting the operator,

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ],[sinθ, -cosθ]] * |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation is:

[ [cosθ   sinθ]   [a]   = [a]
  [sinθ  -cosθ]   [b]     [b] ]

Which gives two equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a

sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a - (cosθ + 1) b = 0

Wait, equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a = (cosθ + 1) b. So equation 2: sinθ a - (cosθ +1) b =0.

Now, we can write these as a system of equations:

( (cosθ -1) ) a + (
