Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's try to understand what's going on. The question is about a star similar to the Sun, but it's got some dark spots on one hemisphere. And these spots are causing the star's brightness to vary, which can mimic the effect of an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots do. Got it.

First, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. So the formula for the light curve amplitude (ΔF) is something like the area of the planet divided by the area of the star, squared maybe? Wait, no, wait—no, it's the area blocked. So the area ratio is (R_planet / R_star)^2. But wait, the star's brightness variation due to spots is a bit different.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Oh, wait, the filling factor is 20%—so that's the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered in spots. Since a hemisphere is half the star's surface, the total area covered by spots is 0.5 (hemisphere) multiplied by 0.2 (filling factor), so 0.1 of the entire star's surface. Because a hemisphere is 50% of the area, so 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1.

But wait, the spots are cooler regions, right? Because they're dark. So they emit less light. So when the star rotates and the spots come into view, the observed brightness from that hemisphere decreases. The total brightness of the star is a combination of the normal parts and the spots.

So normally, the star's brightness is based on its effective temperature, Teff of 6000 K. The spots are at Teff - 1000 K, so 5000 K. Wait, no, the temperature difference is 1000 K. So if the star is 6000 K, the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K, but I think it's cooler because spots are darker. So let's say the spots are 5000 K. 

The flux from a star is proportional to the surface area and the temperature to the fourth power. So the flux from the star without spots is F_total = sigma * Teff^4 * (4π R^2), but I think when calculating the variation, we can compare the flux from the spot area to the rest.

Wait, the star emits a certain amount of light. The spots are cooler, so when they are visible, the total emitted light decreases. The brightness variation comes from the difference between when the spots are facing us (and blocking more light) and when they're not. Wait, no, actually, the spots are on the surface, but they emit less light. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the total brightness dip.

Wait, but the question says that the star's brightness varies due to rotation.
