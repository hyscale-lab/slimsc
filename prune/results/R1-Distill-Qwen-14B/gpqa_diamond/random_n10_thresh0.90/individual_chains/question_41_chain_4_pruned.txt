Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a glass. Hmm, the glass is moving, and I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the problem states that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass as seen by someone in the lab. Oh right, and the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so I can use that.

Wait, index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) would be v_glass = c/n. Since c is 1, that's 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so I guess I need to consider the motion of the glass and how that affects the observed speed of the light.

This feels like it's related to special relativity because velocities don't just add linearly when things are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. The problem says the glass is moving at velocity v, which I assume is much less than c, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider both possibilities.

Wait, the options don't have any gamma factors, so maybe this is a non-relativistic approach. Or perhaps the problem expects a classical approach. Let me think. In classical physics, velocities add linearly. So if the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, then the speed of the light relative to the lab would be the speed of light in the glass plus the velocity of the glass.

Wait, no. Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the speed of the light in the glass's frame is v_glass = c/n. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, so the lab frame would see the light's speed as v_glass + v? Or wait, no. Because if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction, then the light's speed relative to the lab would be v_glass + v? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, wait. Suppose the glass is moving towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v towards the observer. So the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So relative to the lab, the speed of the light would be the speed of the light in the glass (from the glass's frame) plus the velocity of the glass.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light speed is v_glass = c/n. So from the lab frame, it's v_glass + v? Or wait, no. Wait, when an object is moving towards you, the observed speed of something in the same direction would increase, right? So if the glass is moving towards the observer (so from the lab's point of view, the glass is moving in the direction opposite to the light perhaps?), wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me re-read the problem.
