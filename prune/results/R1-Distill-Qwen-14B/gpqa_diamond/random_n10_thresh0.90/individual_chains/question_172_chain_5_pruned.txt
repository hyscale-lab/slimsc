Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that the photosphere of a star emits light based on its temperature, and the distribution of energy levels in the atoms there depends on the temperature. Oh right, it's about the Boltzmann distribution maybe?

So the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And both photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann equation applies here.

Wait, the Boltzmann factor is used to determine the population of different energy states. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call the two energy levels E_1 and E_2, but wait, the problem says the energy difference is about that value, so I think E_2 - E_1 = delta E. 

The ratio of the populations is given. For star_1, the excited state (E_2) is twice as populated as in star_2. Or wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So, N2,N1 / N1,N2 = 2?

Wait no, wait. Let me get this right. The problem says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that in star_2's for the same energy level. Oh wait, but wait, the specific energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. So, for that level, N1 (star 1) is twice N2 (star 2). 

Let me think more clearly. Letâ€™s define N1 as the number
