Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a smaller spherical cavity. The cavity's radius is r, and its center is at a distance s from the main conductor's center. The point P is outside the conductor, and I need to find the electric field at P.

Wait, the setup says the conductor is uncharged. Then, they put a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. Oh right, when you put a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So how does that work?

I remember that in a conductor, charges can move freely. So if there's a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must develop an induced charge. Since the cavity is inside, the conductor's outer surface would remain neutral, right? Or wait, does the conductor's charge matter? Oh, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface must have an induced charge equal and opposite to q. Because the charge +q inside induces a -q on the inner surface. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q to balance it. But wait, no, wait. Because the conductor is uncharged, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to compensate? Or wait, no, wait again. No, because if the conductor is uncharged, the sum of all charges on it must be zero. So, the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q, but wait, that would make the total charge of the conductor (-q + outer charge) = zero. So the outer surface must have +q. Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, actually, when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have the same charge as the original conductor. But in this case, the conductor was initially neutral. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to make the total charge zero (because conductor was neutral). So the outside of the conductor behaves as if it has a charge +q, right?

But wait, I'm not sure. Another
