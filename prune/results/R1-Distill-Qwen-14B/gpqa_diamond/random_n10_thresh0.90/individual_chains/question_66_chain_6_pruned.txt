Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry involves. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's like the broader symmetry of spacetime. Wait, so if Poincare includes Lorentz, then maybe if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the SMEFT is built by adding operators to the Standard Model, but those operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM. So what symmetries does the Standard Model have? The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, gauge symmetry, and certain other global symmetries. But what about Poincare? Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. I think the SM is Poincare invariant because all terms in the Lagrangian are scalars, and the theory is local, so it should respect translations as well. So operators in the SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they must also respect Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz, then any operator respecting Poincare would automatically respect Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if an operator has to respect Poincare, then it's a subset of thatâ€”so maybe both 1 and 2 are required. But I'm not sure if SMEFT operators are required to respect Poincare or not.

Alternatively, maybe SMEFT doesn't require Poincare symmetry because when you add higher-dimension operators, you might break translation invariance. Wait, but effective field theories typically work in a framework where the symmetries of the original theory (the Standard Model) are preserved. So I think SMEFT should still respect Poincare symmetry because it's an effective theory built from the SM, which is Poincare invariant.

Wait, but maybe not. Because SMEFT includes higher dimension operators, which are constructed from the SM fields, but their coefficients are dimensionful parameters. But how does that affect symmetries? Hmm. For instance, the operators are constructed in such a way that each operator is a Lorentz scalar, which ensures Lorentz invariance. But if the Lagrangian is a sum of such operators, each term respects Lorentz, but what about Poincare?

Poincare includes not only Lorentz transformations but also spacetime translations. So the Lagrangian must be invariant under translations. The way to ensure that is that the Lagrangian is divergence-free, so when you vary under a translation, the variation is a total divergence. But in SMEFT, each operator is a scalar, so their terms in the Lagrangian would transform as scalars, but maybe the coefficients (the Wilson coefficients) could spoil translation invariance unless they are chosen appropriately. Wait, but the SMEFT is typically formulated with the operators multiplied by coefficients that are functions of energy scale, but I'm not sure if that affects translation invariance. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT only requires Lorentz symmetry, not necessarily Poincare. Because when you include operators of higher dimension, the theory may not be translation invariant anymore. Or does it? Because the operators are built from the SM fields, which are translation invariant. So maybe the operators are still translation invariant, ensuring Poincare.

Wait, another approach. The SMEFT is an effective theory, so it's supposed to respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Poincare symmetry. So the SMEFT, which is the SM plus corrections, must also respect Poincare. So if that's the case, the operators in the SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. But wait, if Poincare is a larger symmetry, perhaps requiring both is redundant? Or perhaps the question lists them as separate options because they are separate aspects.

But looking back at the
