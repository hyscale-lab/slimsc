Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two states. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in energy and the lifetime (or the time over which the energy is measured). The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Or sometimes people use ΔE Δt ~ ħ, depending on the exact formulation. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants here.

So, the idea is that the uncertainty in energy ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime Δt. If the lifetime is very short, the energy uncertainty is large, making it hard to distinguish small energy differences. But if the lifetime is longer, the uncertainty is smaller, so smaller differences can be detected.

In this problem, the two states have different lifetimes. The first has a lifetime of 1e-9 seconds, and the second 1e-8 seconds. Wait, but the question is which energy difference would allow them to be clearly distinguished. So perhaps we're being asked about the minimum energy difference that can be resolved, given their lifetimes.

Wait no, the problem says that we want to clearly distinguish the two energy levels. So the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty, perhaps. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we can't tell them apart. So the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

But wait, each state has its own lifetime. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime, right? So for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 s, the uncertainty ΔE1 is ħ/(2Δt1). Similarly for the second state, ΔE2 is ħ/(2Δt2).

But wait, wait. Are we considering each state's uncertainty, or is there a combined uncertainty? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the natural linewidth in a spectral line. The natural linewidth arises due to the finite lifetime of the quantum state, and it's given by ΔE = ħ/τ, where τ is the lifetime.

So if two states have different lifetimes, their natural linewidths are different. To resolve them, the energy difference between them must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe just larger than the larger uncertainty. Because if the two states are too close in energy, their lines would overlap beyond the linewidths.

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact condition. Let me think of it this way: the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for both states. Because if the difference is smaller than either uncertainty, then the two energies could overlap, making them indistinguishable.

Wait, no, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the uncertainty of the system. Or maybe it's the uncertainty in the measurement, which would be determined by the shorter of the two lifetimes?

Wait, I think I'm mixing two things. Let me clarify the setup. Each energy level has a certain lifetime, which gives a certain energy uncertainty. The energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, or maybe just larger than the larger uncertainty. Because if the energy difference is bigger than the uncertainty, then you can tell them apart.

So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/(2 τ2). Since τ1 is 1e-9 s and τ2 is 1e-8 s, τ2 is bigger. So ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1 because ΔE is inversely proportional to τ.

Wait, let me compute the uncertainties. Let's plug in the numbers. Let's take ħ as approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

For E1, τ1=1e-9 s:

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 τ1) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) ≈ 5.27e-26 J. We need to
