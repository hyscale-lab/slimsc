Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question is about finding the normalization constant 'a' for a given wave function. 

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function should be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. 

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this interval, but the given wave function is defined in the region where it can exist. So I think the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 should be 1.

Let me write down the wave function again: ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i. So the absolute square is the product of ψ and its complex conjugate. The conjugate would be [a / sqrt(1 + x)] + 0.5i. So when I multiply them, the cross terms (the ones with i) will involve terms like a * 0.5i and -0.5i * a. Let me calculate that product.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The absolute square is ψ*ψ, which is [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i ] * [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i ].

Multiplying these out: (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5i a)/(sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i a)/(sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(0.5i).

Wait, simplifying, the middle terms cancel out because one is + and the other is -. So we're left with (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25)(i²), because (0.5i)(0.5i) is 0.25 i². Since i² is -1, that becomes -0.25. So the absolute square is (a²/(1+x)) - (0.25).

Wait, but hold on. The wave function must have a real probability density, so the imaginary parts should cancel out. So in the wave function, the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when I take the absolute square, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.25), because (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and the cross terms (which are imaginary) would cancel each other. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that.

Wait, when you multiply (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Oh wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i), so the complex conjugate is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply:

[(a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i] * [(a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i] = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 - (0.5i)^2.

Because (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b². So (0.5i)^2 is (0.25)(i²) which is -0.25. So the absolute square becomes (a²)/(1+x) - (-0.25) = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right because the absolute square should be a real positive function. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Hmm, but wait, that doesn't make sense because if a has any value, the second term is a positive constant. So when we integrate this from x=1 to x=3, the integral should be 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5i). So the complex conjugate is [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + 0.5i. So when I multiply them, I get (a^2)/(1+x) + (i * a * 0.5)/(sqrt(1+x)) ) - (i * a * 0.5)/(sqrt(1+x)) ) - (0.5i)^2.

The first term is (a^2)/(1+x). The second and third terms are +i (0.5 a / sqrt(1+x)) and -i (0.5 a / sqrt(1+x)), which cancel each other. The last term is -(0.5)^2 * i^2. i squared is -1, so that's -0.25*(-1) = +0.25. So the absolute square is (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. So to normalize, the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx should equal 1.

Wait, but wait, that can't be correct because if I have a function that's (something) plus a positive constant, the integral would be a sum of two terms. Let me proceed.

So the integral of (a²)/(1+x) from 1 to 3 is a² times ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. Because the integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C. So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

Then, the integral of 0.25 from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5. And this should equal 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's the value of ln(2)? It's approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I square the absolute value, I get (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, right? Because (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b², but since b is imaginary, b squared is (0.5i)^2 = -0.25. So a²/(1+x) - (-0.25) = a²/(1+x) + 0.25. That's correct.

Then the integral from 1 to 3 is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1. So a² = (0.5)/(ln 2) → a ≈ sqrt(0.5/0.6931). Let me compute that.

0.5 is 0.5. Divided by 0.6931 is approximately 0.7213. The square root is about 0.849, so 0.85 is the closest option, which is option B.


To determine the normalization constant \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the integral of the probability density \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) equals 1. The probability density is calculated as:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

Breaking this into two terms:

1. The integral of \( \frac{a^2}{1+x} \) from 1 to 3 is:
   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \ln(1+x) \Big|_1^3 = a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. The integral of \( 0.25 \) from 1 to 3 is:
   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \( a \) among the options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
