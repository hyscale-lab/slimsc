Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the chemical formula among the options provided: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around that region usually indicates O-H stretching. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid? Wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, but so do alcohols. But the presence of other peaks might help.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is likely a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, which makes me think maybe an aromatic ring? Like conjugated double bonds, perhaps. Or maybe an ester or something else with a conjugated system. Alternatively, it could be a carbonyl group with some adjacent electron-withdrawing groups which lower the wavenumber.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, so that suggests there's a double bond in the structure. Maybe an alkene or something like that.

The Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. That's a key clue. What fragments give m/z 45? Let's think. Common fragments with 45 include... Hmm, maybe the CH3CO+ ion (which is 45, since CH3CO+ is 45 g/mol). Or maybe a ketene ion? Or perhaps it's an acylium ion. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment from a carbonyl group. Also, the molecular ion could lose certain parts to give this fragment.

Wait, let me think about possible compounds.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So the options vary in the number of hydrogens and oxygen atoms. Let's consider each.

The FTIR has O-H (broad peak), so possible functional groups are alcohol, phenol, carboxylic acid, ester. But wait, esters don't have O-H groups. So the compound must have an O-H group. So options with O or O2.

Looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2: Could be esters, but wait, no O-H. Or maybe a diol or something else. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid (but then the O would be two O, but the formula would have two O).

Wait, let me think again. The FTIR shows O-H (so it's -OH). So the compound has either an -OH group, which would be an alcohol or a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, O can be either one or two. So which of the options have O or O2 and a -OH group?

Option B is C6H10O: So one oxygen. Maybe an alcohol. Or a phenol, but phenols have two O's (but C6H5OH is C6H6O, but the formula here is C6H10O, which has more H than that. So maybe a di-substituted phenol? Hmm, not sure.

Option D is C6H12O: again, one O. So likely an alcohol.

Options A and C have two O's. So could be esters, but they don't have O-H. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, it has -COOH, which has two O's in the COOH group. So COOH is O2.

Wait, but the FTIR has a broad O-H. So the compound must have an -OH group. So for the options:

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), that would mean two O atoms. So possible functional groups could be a carboxylic acid (which has two O's in COOH) and perhaps an alcohol, but that would require more O's. Alternatively, maybe an ester (but esters don't have O-H groups, so if the IR shows O-H, that can't be). Alternatively, maybe a ketone and an alcohol? No, because the O count would be two, and the presence of a carbonyl in the IR.

Wait, let me think of a structure that has both an O-H and a carbonyl group. For example, a beta-keto alcohol, perhaps. Or maybe an aldehyde with an alcohol, but that would have two O's. Alternatively, a hemiacetal or something else.

But perhaps the presence of two carbonyl peaks (1700 and 1650 cm^-1) suggests something else. Maybe one is a carbonyl from a ketone or ester, and the other is conjugated, like in an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought: the peaks at 1700 and 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. That would have a conjugated double bond, which could lower the carbonyl stretch to around 1700 maybe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring (C=C stretch). But wait, aromatic C=C stretches are usually around 1600 cm^-1. So 1650 could be from something else. Maybe an amide? But the presence of an O-H would suggest otherwise.

Alternatively, the peaks could be from two different carbonyl groups. Maybe a ketone and an ester? But that would require more O's. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the NMR: vinyl hydrogens are present. So the molecule has a double bond, probably an alkene. So maybe the compound is a substituted cyclohexene with some substituents.

Putting this together: the molecule has an O-H group, a carbonyl (possibly an ester or ketone?), a double bond (vinyl protons), and perhaps more.

Now, the mass spec shows a peak at m/z=45. Let me think about what 45 is. 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CO+ (45, since CH3CO is 45 g/mol). Another possibility is that it's a fragment from a larger molecule.

If the molecular ion breaks off a CH3CO group, that would leave another fragment. Alternatively, another possibility is that it's an acetyl group.

Alternatively, 45 could be the m/z from something else. Let's think about common ions: 45 could be from a ketene ion (R-CO), or maybe an acylium ion. Or maybe it's the loss of something else.

Let me think about the options again. Let's consider each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible functional groups could be an ester (but no O-H), a diol (two O-H groups, but the IR only shows one broad peak, possibly from one OH?), or perhaps a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. Wait, but that would require more O's. No, wait, a carboxylic acid has two O's, but adding another O for an alcohol would make it O3. So that's not possible with option A which is O2. So maybe a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. Lactones have an ester group but no O-H. So that can't be since the IR shows O-H.

Option B: C6H10O. One O. Could be an alcohol. Then the other peaks in IR: 1700 and 1650. So if it's an alcohol, where's the carbonyl? So maybe the compound is something like cyclohexanol with a ketone substituent. So like cyclohexanone methyl something. No, wait, the formula is C6H10O. So if it's cyclohexanol, the formula is C6H12O, but that's option D, not B. So if it's C6H10O, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with an OH group and a carbonyl? Hmm, perhaps.

Option C: C6H10O2. Two O's. Could be a carboxylic acid or an ester. But if it's a carboxylic acid, it would have an O-H, which fits the IR. So a structure like hexanoic acid? But wait, that would be a straight chain, but the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Hexanoic acid is C6H12O2. So maybe it's a substituted acid, like with a double bond. For example, maybe pentenoic acid. Or perhaps it's an ester with a double bond, but then the O-H would be absent. Alternatively, another possibility is a cyclic ester (lactone), but that would have no O-H. So perhaps the structure is a diol with a ketone. Wait, but that would require more O's. Hmm.

Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl group in the IR suggests a ketone or an ester. So if it's a diol, which doesn't have a carbonyl, that might not fit. So perhaps the structure has both a carbonyl and an O-H group. Maybe a beta-keto alcohol. For instance, something like CH2(CO)CH(OH)CH2CH2CH3. But would that fit the molecular formulas?

Alternatively, let's think about the mass spec again. The fragment at m/z 45 suggests the presence of a CH3CO group. How does that fit into the structure?

So perhaps the compound is something like cyclopentanone with an alcohol group, but that would need to fit the molecular formula.

Wait, a cyclohexenone derivative. For example, consider something like methyl cyclohexenone. Wait, but molecular formulas vary.

Alternatively, the structure could be an aromatic compound with an O-H group and an ester. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and their possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation would be (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one double bond or ring. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, suggesting a double bond. So perhaps cyclohexene with an ester group. But esters have no O-H, so that doesn't fit the IR O-H.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 2. So either two rings, two double bonds, or one of each.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (14 -10)/2=2. So two double bonds or rings.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of unsaturation: (14 -12)/2=1.

But the NMR shows vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. So the structure must have at least one double bond.

Looking back at the IR: the two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound has two carbonyl groups, perhaps an ester and a ketone. But then, the O count would be higher. Alternatively, one carbonyl and the other peak is from something else, like an aromatic ring.

Wait, another thought: 1700 could be an ester or ketone, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring's C=C. If the molecule is aromatic, like a benzene ring with substituents.

But the options don't include benzene rings? Or maybe they do. Let's think: if it's a substituted benzene with an ester group and an O-H, that could fit.

Wait, but the options have C6H10O2, which is similar to the formula of benzoic acid (C7H6O2), but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe a substituted benzaldehyde with an alcohol group? But that's getting too vague.

Wait, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester with an O-H group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ketone with an alcohol substituent. But I'm not certain.

Let me try to think about the mass spec. If the fragment is m/z 45, which is 45 g/mol, that's likely CH3CO+ (45). So if the molecule loses a CH3CO group, then the remaining part would be a fragment, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl, and during fragmentation, the ethyl group breaks off, leaving the carbonyl part. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for each option:

Option C: C6H10O2. The molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114.

So if the molecular ion is at m/z 114, but the fragment is at 45. So in the mass spec, perhaps the molecule breaks into a 45 fragment and the rest.

So, 114 -45 =69. So another fragment would be 69. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that tells me much.

Alternatively, the base peak is at 45. So maybe the molecule has a fragment that weighs 45, like CH3CO, as I thought earlier.

So, if the molecule has a CH3CO group attached, then perhaps it's an ester, like ethyl acetate. Wait, but ethyl acetate's formula is C4H8O2. That's not matching any of the options here.

Wait, perhaps it's a larger ester. For example, something like methyl cyclohexanecarboxylate. But then the formula would be C7H10O2, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is cyclohexene with an acetyl group attached. For example, if the molecule is cyclohex-2-enyl acetate. But wait, I'm not sure about the formula.

Wait, maybe the structure is a diethyl acetal, but that would have more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. But then, the O-H would be absent, which contradicts the IR.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try another angle.

The IR shows O-H (so OH group), a carbonyl (so either ketone, ester, aldehyde, acid), and another peak at 1650. NMR has vinyl protons (so a double bond).

So, possible structures:

1. An alcohol with a ketone group and a double bond. So maybe something like cyclohexenol with a ketone substituent.

But then, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2? Let me see: a cyclohexene ring has 6 carbons, one double bond, and then adding a ketone group (O) and an OH group (another O). That would make two O's, so C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C.

Would such a structure have the NMR peaks? Vinyl protons on the cyclohexene ring would show up, so that fits.

The IR: O-H (broad peak), ketone (around 1700), and maybe the cyclohexene's C=C at around 1650. Alternatively, the 1650 peak could be due to conjugation with something else.

The Mass Spec: Would such a molecule fragment to produce a 45 m/z peak? If the molecule has an acetyl group (-COCH3), which would have a mass of 59 (COCH3 is 59 g/mol, but wait, CH3
