Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. So the conductor isn't just a solid sphere but has a hollow part inside.

Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, and there's an angle θ between l and s.

The options are four different expressions for E, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges inside cavities. When a conductor is uncharged and has a cavity with a charge inside, the conductor's charges will redistribute. But wait, the conductor itself was initially uncharged. Oh right, when you put a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have no net charge because the conductor was neutral. Or wait, no—if the conductor is neutral, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, then the inner surface of the conductor must have -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface must have +q? Wait, no—no, wait. Let me think.

Inside the cavity is +q. The conductor is uncharged overall. The charges in the conductor will rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, because that would produce an electric field that cancels the field from +q inside the conductor material. Because the conductor is a conductor, the electric field inside it must be zero. So the inner surface has -q, and since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Wait, no, because the conductor's total charge is zero initially. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no. The conductor is initially uncharged, so the total charge is zero. When you place +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have -q to cancel the field in the conductor's material. Because the conductor is neutral overall, the remaining charge on the outer surface must be +q. Wait, no—if the conductor was neutral, then the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So inner is -q, outer is +q, but that sums to zero. Wait, no, because the conductor's charge is zero. So if the inner surface is -q, then the outer surface must be +q, but that would make the total charge of the conductor zero (since -q + q = 0). Oh, wait, that makes sense. So the conductor's inner surface has -q, outer has +q. But wait, that would mean that the conductor now has a net charge of zero, because -q + q = 0. So that's correct.

But
