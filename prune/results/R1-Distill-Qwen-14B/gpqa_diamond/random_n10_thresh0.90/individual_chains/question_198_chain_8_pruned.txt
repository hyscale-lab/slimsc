Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about coordination complexes and stability constants. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. They also provided the stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, blue dithiocyanato... I remember that Co(II) complexes can have different colors based on the number of SCN- ligands attached. The blue one is probably the one with two SCN- ions, like [Co(SCN)_2]^n+. Or wait, maybe the dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)2]^+? Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2] something else. I think in this context, the dithiocyanato refers to the complex with two SCN- ligands. So the species we're interested in is the one where Co is coordinated with two SCN- ions. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe it's another number. I'll have to think about that as I go.

The stability constants, β, are given for each complex. Stability constant (formation constant) tells us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. The general formula for the formation of a complex is:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) 

The stability constant βn is Kf = [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So for each n (number of SCN-), βn is given. The values are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the most stable is n=3, since β3 is 63, which is the highest. But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is n=2. So β2 is 40.

But wait, sometimes these complexes have different charges. Let me make sure. For n=2, the charge would be Co^2+ with two SCN^- (each -1), so overall charge is 2+ - 2 = 0. So the complex is neutral. Hmm, okay.

The problem is about finding the percentage of the [Co(SCN)_2] species among all possible Co species. So I need to calculate the mole fraction of each possible complex and then find the fraction that corresponds to the dithiocyanato (n=2) case.

Wait, but Co can also be in free ion form, right? So the total Co species can be: free Co^2+ (n=0), [Co(SCN)]+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2] (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^− (n=3), and [Co(SCN)_4]^2− (n=4). So all these species are present in the solution.

The approach is to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants, and find the fraction of each species.

But I remember that when dealing with multiple stability constants, the successive approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex based on the previous ones, using the β values and the concentrations.

Alternatively, I can model this using the formula for each complex's concentration, considering the stepwise formation.

Let me think: the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. The first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+, with β1=9.

The second step is [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2], with β2=40.

Wait, but the overall β for the second complex (n=2) is given as β2=40, but wait, no—wait, actually, the stability constants provided are for the overall complexes, not stepwise. Oh wait, no, the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, etc." So each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ions.

Wait, that's important. So for [Co(SCN)_n], the stability constant is βn. So [Co(SCN)_n] = βn * [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, but that might complicate things because the presence of multiple complexes can affect each other. So I need to compute the concentration of each complex in the solution considering all possible species.

The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^− + [Co(SCN)_4]^2− = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So, let me denote the concentrations as follows:

Let [Co^2+] = x

[Co(SCN)]^+ = y

[Co(SCN)_2] = z

[Co(SCN)_3]^− = w

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− = v

We know that x + y + z + w + v = c(Co) = 0.01 M.

But with the stability constants, each complex can be expressed in terms of x (free Co^2+) and [SCN^-].

Wait, let's see. For each complex:

y = β1 * x * [SCN^-]

z = β2 * x * [SCN^-]^2

w = β3 * x * [SCN^-]^3

v = β4 * x * [SCN^-]^4

Is that correct? Because for β2, it's the overall formation constant for the complex with two SCN- ions. So [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

But wait, that's assuming that the formation is in one step, but the multiple complexes may form in a stepwise manner, leading to a different formula.
