Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the reciprocal of distance, right? Like plx = 1/distance. Or wait, isn't parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs? Oh yeah, right, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then substituting that in, N is proportional to 1/((1/r))^5. Let me compute that. 1/(1/r)^5 is the same as r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. Wait, but that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, perhaps they're asking about the differential number of stars, like the number per unit distance. So maybe we need to find how N changes as a function of r, and then take the derivative.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number density or the number in a thin shell. Let me think. If the number of stars is proportional to r^5, then for each thin shell at radius r with thickness dr, the number of stars would be something like proportional to r^5 * dr. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4πr² dr, but here the dependence is given as N ~ 1/(plx)^5, which is r^5.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me break it down step by step.

Given: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

But plx = 1/r, so replacing that in, N ∝ (r)^5.

So N is proportional to r^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. Oh, maybe they're asking for the differential number—like, how many stars are in a small range dr around r. So that
