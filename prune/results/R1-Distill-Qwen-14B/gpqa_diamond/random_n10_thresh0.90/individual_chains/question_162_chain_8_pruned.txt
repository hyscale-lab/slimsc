Okay, so I have this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that's written in terms of x and y. So this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's got dx² and dy² terms. So it's a 2D spacetime perhaps?

I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, since it's a 2D metric, maybe it's a model of some sort, like a 2D surface embedded in higher dimensions?

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, right? Like the tractricoid, which is the surface of a pseudosphere. So maybe this metric represents such a surface.

But wait, the area of a pseudosphere... Oh, wait, in Euclidean space, a pseudosphere isn't a sphere, but in some other sense. Or perhaps in this context, it's referring to a sphere in anti-de Sitter space or something similar.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the metric. The general form of the metric for a surface of revolution (like a sphere or a pseudosphere) can be written in terms of x and y, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider this as a metric in two dimensions with some symmetry.

Looking at the metric, it's (32/(4 - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). So the denominator is (4 - (x² + y²)). Hmm, that looks like something approaching a singularity when x² + y² approaches 4. So the radius squared is approaching 4, which would make the denominator zero. That suggests the curvature becomes infinite at r = 2. So this is a model where the surface is defined for r < 2, because when r approaches 2, the metric blows up.

Wait, but pseudospheres are usually considered in hyperbolic space. Oh, wait, maybe this is a representation of a sphere in a space with constant negative curvature. Because in such a space, the geometry is hyperbolic, and the metric would have a term that makes the area integral diverge, perhaps.

Wait, I'm trying to find the area. For a 2D surface, the area can be computed using the metric. The area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. Since this is a diagonal metric, the determinant is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy², so g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

Wait, no. Wait, the metric tensor components are in terms of dx² and dy². So the metric is:

ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy² + cross terms. But here, the cross terms are zero (no dx dy term), and g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric tensor is diagonal with both components equal. 

The determinant of the metric in 2D is (g_{xx} * g_{yy} - 0) since it's diagonal. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

Wait, but for the area element, it's sqrt(g) dx dy. So sqrt(g) = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, but I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. What is the domain of x and y? Since the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²), the denominator must be positive to have a real metric. So 4 - (x² + y²) > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region of integration is the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy, where I converted to polar coordinates, since the problem is symmetric in x and y.

Wait, in polar coordinates, x² + y² = r², and dx dy = r dr dθ. So the area integral becomes:

Area = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral. Let's factor out the constants. The θ integral is straightforward.

Area = 2π * ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 * (-du/2)] / u.

Wait, wait, substituting the limits:

∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) → ∫ (32 (-du/2)) / u = ∫ (-16) (du/u).

The integral of (1/u) du is ln|u|, so:

-16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, when u approaches 0 from the positive side, ln(u) approaches -infinity. So the integral becomes:

-16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → but ln(0) is negative infinity, so this becomes:

-16 [ (-infinity) - ln(4) ] = -16 [ -infinity ] = positive infinity?

Wait, wait
