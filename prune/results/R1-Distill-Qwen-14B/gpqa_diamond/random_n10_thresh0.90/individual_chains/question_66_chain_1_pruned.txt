Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? I think Lorentz symmetry includes the transformations of the coordinates (like rotations and boosts) that leave the speed of light constant. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time, so it's like the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. So if an operator respects Poincare symmetry, it must also respect Lorentz symmetry. But does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry?

I remember that the SMEFT is built from operators that are invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, the Lorentz group, and possibly other symmetries. Wait, the Standard Model already includes Lorentz symmetry. So SMEFT, as an effective theory, would require that all operators transform correctly under the Lorentz group, meaning Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes translations. But in an effective field theory, operators can have different scaling dimensions, and the theory is valid up to some cutoff scale. I'm not sure if SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. Wait, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory because it's an effective theory built from the Standard Model. Lorentz symmetry is definitely required, but I'm not so sure about Poincare. Because Poincare involves translations, which are part of the spacetime symmetries. Oh, wait, but all the operators in SMEFT are local, meaning they have to make sense under Poincare because they're part of a relativistic quantum field theory. So maybe all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Poincare group includes translations, which are global symmetries. In a QFT, all interactions are local and translationally invariant. So operators in the theory must be built from fields that transform correctly under Poincare. So SMEFT would require Poincare symmetry as well. So options 1 and 2 must be correct.

Then, what about CP and CPT symmetries? CP is charge conjugation combined with parity. CPT is the combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. I remember that in the Standard Model, CPT is a symmetry, but CP isn't necessarily. SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So, do the SMEFT operators have to respect CP symmetry?

Wait, the question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. The Standard Model doesn't require CP symmetry, so SMEFT shouldn't either. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, similar to the Standard Model. So option 3 is out.

What about CPT symmetry? I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories. Every QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Putting it together, the symmetries that must be respected are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but wait, I thought Poincare includes Lorentz. So if all operators must respect Poincare, then they must automatically respect Lorentz. So the question is whether the SMEFT requires operators to respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or just Poincare implies Lorentz.

But the question gives the options, and one of them includes 1 and 2. So I think in the SMEFT, operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. Because Poincare includes translations, which are important for the structure of the theory. So options 1 and 2 are correct, as well as 4.

Wait, but the options are given as 1,2; 3,4; 1,2,4; or 1,3,4. So the correct set would include 1, 2, and 4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I thought that in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz structure, gauge group, etc., but do they need to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a QFT, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry because they are part of a local field theory. So yes, operators must respect both, but since Poincare implies Lorentz, perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2, but the question is whether it's required.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a stronger condition that includes Lorentz, then if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But the question includes both 1 and 2 as separate options. So perhaps the answer includes both 1 and 2 because they are separate symmetries.

Alternatively, maybe Poincare is considered as a separate symmetry beyond Lorentz, but in reality, Poincare includes Lorentz. So perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2 because the question lists them separately as options.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about what each symmetry entails.

Lorentz symmetry: invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations, boosts).
Poincare symmetry: invariance under Lorentz transformations plus translations (spatial and temporal).

So Poincare is a larger group. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. So if the question is asking which symmetries must be respected, and Poincare is a superset, then perhaps the correct symmetries are Poincare (and hence Lorentz) and CPT.

Wait, but the question lists both 1 and 2 as options. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but that doesn't make sense because Poincare already includes Lorentz. But the question is about which of these must be respected by all operators.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that the operators must respect Lorentz and CPT. Because I'm not sure if Poincare is a separate symmetry that must be respected beyond Lorentz.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare symmetry is automatically satisfied if the theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation-invariant. Wait, but in the SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that respects Lorentz symmetry, but do they also have to respect translations? Because the operators are part of a QFT, which includes translation invariance. So perhaps the SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, no. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if the operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. So perhaps the correct required symmetries are Poincare and CPT.

Wait, but looking back, the options are 1,2; 3,4; 1,2,4; and 1,3,4.

If the correct symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but the options don't have an option including all three. Wait, option C says 1,2,4. So that would include Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But wait, if operators respect Poincare, they don't need to separately respect Lorentz because Poincare implies Lorentz. So maybe the answer includes Poincare and CPT, but the question lists Lorentz as a separate option.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the question is phrased, the correct answer is that symmetries 1, 2, and 4 must be respected. Because SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetries.

Wait, but I'm not certain about Poincare. Another approach: in the Standard Model, the theory is Poincare invariant. So the SMEFT, being an effective theory of the Standard Model, must also be Poincare invariant. Therefore, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz. So the correct symmetries are 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT). But then, what about option 1 (Lorentz)? Well, if the operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz, so the answer would include 2 and 4, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again. The options are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

So if the correct symmetries are 2 (Poincare) and 4 (CPT), but none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm wrong about Poincare symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps SMEFT requires operators to respect Lorentz but not necessarily Poincare. But that doesn't make sense because without translation invariance, the theory wouldn't make sense as a QFT.

Wait, maybe another approach. The original Standard Model respects all of these symmetries except CP. So when building an effective theory, the SMEFT includes all operators that are allowed by the Standard Model symmetries.
