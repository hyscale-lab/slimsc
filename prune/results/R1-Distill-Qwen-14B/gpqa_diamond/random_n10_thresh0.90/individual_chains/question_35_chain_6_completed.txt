Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let me think.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. From what I remember, angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to Pauli matrices, especially for spin-½ particles like the muon mentioned here.

Wait, the problem says Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Oh, that looks familiar. Let me write down matrix S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, wait a second. I think this might be the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. The standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y.

So, Ay = c * sigma_y. And c is h/(4π). So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

To find the eigenvalues of Ay, I remember that for a Pauli matrix multiplied by a scalar, the eigenvalues are the scalar times the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrix. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues +1 and -1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So, Ay's eigenvalues would be (h/(4π)) * (+1) and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So, that's a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Their imaginary parts are zero because these are real numbers. Oh wait, wait, the options might have some complex eigenvalues. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, that doesn't match what I have here because the eigenvalues are real. So A can't be correct.

Option B: The eigenvalues have real parts ±1, imaginary ±1/2. Wait, that doesn't fit either because I'm getting real eigenvalues.

Option C: It says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum, different components don't share eigenfunctions except for commuting operators. Since [Ay, A²] is zero (because angular momentum components square commutes with each other), the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A². But Az is another component, and [Ay, Az] doesn't commute, so they can't share eigenfunctions. So C might be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Wait, I'm not sure what that means. Maybe the basis functions are the eigenvectors? Well, in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so that's true. But does that make D correct? I'm not sure. The statement says "are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay". Hmm, I'm not so confident about that. Maybe it's correct, but let's think more.

Wait, let me get back to the eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, none of A or B match this. Looking at option D, it's about the eigenvectors being the basis functions. Well, the eigenvectors are the basis vectors for the operator, in a sense, but I'm not sure if that's what D is saying.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct statements are about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors properties.

Wait, let me think again. The operator Ay is (h/(4π)) times sigma_y. Sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So Ay's eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So real numbers, no imaginary parts. So looking at the options, none of A or B apply because all options A and B have eigenvalues with imaginary parts. So A and B can be eliminated.

Now, looking at option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not Az.

A² is the square of the angular momentum operator. For spin, A² is s(s+1)ħ², where s=½. So A² is (3/4)ħ². So the eigenvalue is (3/4)ħ², and the eigenfunction is the same as for any component, because A² commutes with all components. So any eigenstate of Ay will be an eigenstate of A². But they won't be eigenstates of Az because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something (I think it's iħ A_x or something), so they don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: Are the eigenfunctions of Ay the basis functions of Ay? Well, the matrix operator's eigenvectors form a basis. So the basis functions are indeed the eigenvectors. So D's statement is correct. Wait, but the statement says "the eigenfunctions phi of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay." Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. The basis functions usually refer to the basis in the vector space. So the eigenvectors would form an orthonormal basis, yes. So D might be correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's think about each option.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A². That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so you can have simultaneous eigenfunctions.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's the right way to phrase it. The eigenvectors are the basis functions, perhaps. But I'm not certain. So perhaps C and D are candidates.

Wait, the question is about multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Wait, the problem says the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator. So the operator is Ay. The eigenfunctions phi are for Ay. The matrix is 2x2, so we're dealing with a spin-½ system.

Now, to think about the eigenvectors. The eigenvectors of sigma_y are (1, i) and (1, -i), I think. Because sigma_y |+> = |+> ?

Wait, let me calculate. The Pauli Y matrix: when applied to the eigenvectors, we get eigenvalues ±1. Let's compute the eigenvectors.

The matrix S is sigma_y. So, for eigenvalue +1: (S - I)|v> =0.

S = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So S - I = [[-1, -i], [i, -1]]

The equations are:

-1 * v1 - i v2 =0

i v1 -1 v2=0

From first equation: v1 = -i v2

Substitute into second equation: i (-i v2) -v2 =0 → (-i^2 v2) -v2 = ( -(-1) v2 ) -v2 → v2 -v2 =0 → 0=0. So the eigenvectors are proportional to (v1, v2) = (-i v2, v2) → v2( -i, 1 ). So take v2=1, so eigenvector is ( -i, 1 ). Similarly, for eigenvalue -1: (S + I)|v> =0.

S + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]]

Equations:

v1 -i v2 =0

i v1 + v2=0

From first equation: v1 =i v2

Substitute into second: i*(i v2) + v2 = (-1) v2 + v2 =0 → 0=0. So eigenvectors are proportional to (i, 1). So the two eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are these two vectors. So when you have any linear combination of these, they form the basis.

So option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the eigenvectors are indeed the basis vectors for the space, so they form an orthonormal basis. So D's statement is correct.

Wait, but the operator is 2x2, so its eigenvectors span the space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So the statement in D is correct.

But let's go back to the options.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so simultaneous eigenfunctions exist. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so they can't share eigenfunctions. So C is correct.

Now, looking at the options, both C and D may be correct. But wait, the question is which option is correct during the calculation. So perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the problem is asking which statement will I consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps the answer is D, because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Alternatively, C is correct because the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of an operator form a basis for the space. So yes, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis functions. So D's statement is correct.

But wait, the term "basis functions" might be a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, the eigenvectors are the basis vectors.

So in this case, the statement in D is correct. So both C and D may be correct, but the options are exclusive.

Wait, the question is multiple-choice, so only one option can be correct. Let's look again at the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

That's definitely correct because, as A² commutes with Ay, so their eigenfunctions can be shared. But because Az doesn't commute with Ay, their eigenfunctions can't be shared.

So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. As the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so yes, D is correct.

Wait, but I have to choose the correct statement. So the question is which of the statements is correct.

The options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. So which is correct?

Wait, the question asks which statement will you consider correct during the calculation.

So in the calculation, you would find that the eigenfunctions are the basis vectors for the operator. So D's statement is correct.

Alternatively, when finding the eigenfunctions, you would also realize that they are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az, so C is correct.

So I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the options again.

Option C's statement is about the possibility of the eigenfunctions being eigenfunctions of another operator. Whereas option D's statement is about the basis.

The problem is asking which statement is correct. So both C and D may be correct, but I can only choose one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, let's think about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). So looking at the options, none of the options A or B match that. Because A and B have eigenvalues with imaginary parts.

Option C and D are the only possible correct options.

So, the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the eigenfunctions of A², because A² and Ay commute. So you can have the same eigenfunctions for both. But they don't share eigenfunctions with Az because they don't commute.

So statement C is correct.

As for statement D, well, any operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D's statement is correct. But the way it's phrased could be tricky. The statement says "eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator." Well, the matrix operator is a 2x2 matrix, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but no, the options are presented as four separate options, so only one can be correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix operator is represented in the basis of the Hilbert space. So if the eigenvectors are the basis functions, then the matrix in that basis would be diagonal. So the statement in D is correct.

So now, I'm a bit stuck between C and D.

Let me think about the process. When calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, I find the eigenvalues to be ±h/(4π), which are real. The eigenvectors are the basis functions. So D is correct.

But also, since the operator Ay commutes with A², the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

The options are presented as four, of which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenfunctions form the basis.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. But I think I'll go with option C being correct because the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Wait, but wait, the eigenfunctions of Ay are also the eigenfunctions of A² because A² commutes with Ay. So that's correct.

So given that, I think the correct answer is C.


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix. The matrix \( S \) is given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli \( \sigma_y \) matrix. The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_y \) are \( \pm 1 \), so the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. This eliminates options \( A \) and \( B \), as they suggest eigenvalues with imaginary parts.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A**: Suggests eigenvalues with imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

2. **Option B**: Suggests eigenvalues with real parts \( \pm 1 \) and imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real (\( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \)).

3. **Option C**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator) but not of \( A_z \) (the Z-component of angular momentum). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), allowing simultaneous eigenfunctions, whereas \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions cannot overlap.

4. **Option D**: States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). While it is true that the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space, the phrasing of this option is less precise compared to the clarity of Option \( C \). Additionally, the question emphasizes the properties of the eigenfunctions during the calculation, making Option \( C \) more relevant.

### Conclusion:

The correct statement is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and the commuting operator \( A^2 \), while also highlighting the lack of overlap with \( A_z \).
