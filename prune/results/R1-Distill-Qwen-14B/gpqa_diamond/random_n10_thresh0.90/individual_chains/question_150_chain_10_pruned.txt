Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO, and there are some NMR data provided. Then it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options.

First, I should figure out what the starting compound is based on the NMR. Let's look at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet with 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. A triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons usually are deshielded and appear as singlets because there's no adjacent H on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe it's an enal (conjugated aldehyde), where the aldehyde is adjacent to a double bond. Maybe it's a triplet because it's coupling with two protons on the adjacent carbon. Alternatively, could it be an aromatic ring with substituents, but I think more likely it's an aldehyde.

- 6.98 ppm: doublet of 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet might indicate ortho-substituted aromatic protons, or maybe coupling with another proton. But considering the downfield shift, perhaps it's para-substituted with an electron-withdrawing group.

Wait, another peak at 6.51 ppm, also a doublet with 2H. Hmm, perhaps this is another set of aromatic protons. Wait, if the molecule has two sets of aromatic protons, maybe two different substituents on the benzene rings. Alternatively, perhaps a di-substituted aromatic ring with two different substituents.

Then, 6.27 ppm: broad singlet of 2H. Broad suggests exchange or possibly coupling with more than one proton. But wait, singlet with 2H? Could this be a vinyl group or an aromatic ring with a substituent that's causing the protons to be equivalent and not split into a multiplet? Alternatively, perhaps it's an -OCH2- group, but the shift is more upfield than typical for OCH2.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. That's probably an OCH2 group. Because OCH2 protons usually appear around 3.5-4 ppm. So, a doublet would suggest coupling with one neighboring proton. Like maybe -OCH2CH2- but that's a stretch. Wait, if it's -OCH2- attached to something else.

Putting this together: the molecule probably has an aldehyde group, an OCH2 group, and two aromatic rings. Let me think: molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation: Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0, so (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9)/2 = 9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

DoU formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, for each N, it's +1. So:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 → (18 -9 +1)/2 → (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be two aromatic rings (each has 3 DoU → 6) but wait, maybe one ring is substituted differently.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and an oxygen, maybe an ether or a phenol. Let me think.

Looking at the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is 1H, which is probably the aldehyde proton. But wait, in which structure would an aldehyde proton be a triplet? Let me think: maybe if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Like R-CHO where R is CH2CH2... Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system. For example, a cinnamaldehyde type structure.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is an aldehyde with an adjacent double bond, as in an enal. So, something like CH2=CH-CHO. But in this case, the aldehyde would be at the end, and the protons adjacent would be on the double bond. Alternatively, maybe a benzalacetone structure.

Wait, considering the NMR data:

At 9.72 ppm, triplet (1H): aldehyde.

At 6.98 and 6.51, each a doublet (2H each). Maybe that's two aromatic rings, each with two equivalent protons. So perhaps each ring has two substituents in the para positions. Like, two para-substituted benzene rings. So for example, each ring has a substituent at the para position, but it's not clear yet.

Then, 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet of 2H. Could this be a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen? Or perhaps two protons that are part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted ethylene.

The 3.66 ppm, doublet of 2H: likely OCH2-. So maybe the molecule has an OCH2 group attached to something else.

Putting this together: perhaps there's a structure where there's an aldehyde group, an OCH2 group, and two aromatic rings connected in some way.

Wait, another approach: the reaction steps are given. Let me look at those.

The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 and HCl: this is usually used for diazotization, especially with aromatic amines. So the starting compound must have an aromatic amine group (-NH2). But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. The presence of N suggests that, and in the NMR, the 6.27 ppm could be due to a substituent on the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't have a peak for an NH2 group. Hmm, maybe the starting compound is a nitro compound? Or an amine that's been converted.

Wait, the steps:

First, NaNO2 and HCl: this is the diazotization step. So the starting material must have an aromatic amine (like an aniline derivative) to form a diazonium salt. Because after that, the next steps are H2O and aq. KOH with heat. 

Wait, the second step is H2O. So perhaps the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed. The third step is aqueous KOH and heat, which could be a Hofmann elimination or a hydrolysis.

Wait, but the starting material is C8H9NO. Let's see, after NaNO2 and HCl, the molecule would form a diazonium chloride. Then, depending on the conditions, the diazonium group can undergo various reactions.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. If the starting compound is an aniline derivative, then the formula would be C8H9NO? Let's see:

Aniline is C6H7N. If we have an aniline derivative with substituents, like a benzyl group, perhaps. Wait, perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic ring with substituents, including an -NH2 group.

Wait, but in the NMR data, I don't see any peaks that would correspond to an NH2 group. Like, aniline's NH2 is usually around 4-5 ppm, broad. But the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Could that be an NH group? Or perhaps the NH2 is part of a more complex structure.

Wait, let me think again. The starting compound has the formula C8H9NO. If it's an aniline derivative, the formula would be C8H9NO, which would make sense. For example, if the molecule is something like 4-aminophenyl something.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound is 4-aminobenzaldehyde? But the molecular formula would be C7H7NO. Wait, but our starting compound is C8H9NO. Let me calculate:

Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If it's 4-aminobenzaldehyde, formula is C7H7NO. But our starting compound is C8H9NO, which is one more carbon and two more hydrogens
