Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X before it reacts, and then determine what the product is after the reaction. Let's take it step by step.

First, let's look at the given data: the IR and NMR spectra. The IR data is showing peaks at several wavenumbers. The big ones I notice are 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, but since the options don't have amines, maybe it's an O-H, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I recognize as a strong carbonyl group, probably from a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 could be related to aromatic rings, maybe C=C stretches.

Looking at the NMR data: there's a signal at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for one proton. That's pretty upfield for an aromatic proton, but wait, 10.5 is more typical for an aldehyde proton. But wait, if it's a broad signal, maybe it's an O-H group from a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they're usually broad because they're exchangeable. So if the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl, and the NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, that might suggest a carboxylic acid group. Because a carboxylic acid would have both the O-H stretch (from the IR) and the O-H proton in the NMR.

Wait, but the IR also shows a strong peak at 1720, which for a carboxylic acid would be a bit off. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, but maybe in some cases it's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1720-1740 cm-1. But the 10.5 ppm in NMR would be more like an aldehyde. Hmm, now I'm a bit confused.

Looking at the NMR peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest an aromatic ring with two doublets. That points to a para-substituted benzene ring. So, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with another group attached.

The other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which might be a CH next to an electronegative group or possibly part of a chain. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something else. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 group attached to something that deshields it, maybe a CH. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain. The 10.5 ppm peak is a bit puzzling. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and some alkyl substituents. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, but then the IR's 1720 would be more for a ketone or ester, not an aldehyde (which is around 2820 and 2720 for the C-H stretch as well, but that's in the 3400-2500 region).

Wait, the IR's 3400–2500 cm-1 is a broad region, which could include O-H stretch and possibly some C-H stretches. So, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would explain the O-H in IR and the broad peak in NMR. Then, the 1720 cm-1 would be the carboxylic acid's carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR again: the aromatic protons are a doublet each, so para substitution on the benzene. So, the benzene has two substituents in para positions. Or, wait, maybe one substituent is a group that has a substituent itself.

Wait, perhaps the main group attached to the benzene is a carbonyl group. For example, a benzene ring with a -COCH2CH2CH3 group? But then the NMR would show the CH2 groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a propyl group attached, but that doesn't directly explain the carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about the reaction. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus with HI is a reagent used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, or maybe for elimination reactions. Alternatively, it can be used for the hydrolysis of esters, but I'm a bit fuzzy here. Wait, another reaction: maybe it's for the elimination of a hydroxyl group, like in a substitution. Or, perhaps the compound is a bromide and the reaction is a substitution. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI can be used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, particularly in the formation of alcohols via the hydroxymercuration (but that uses Hg(OAc)2 and then HI, not sure). Wait, another possibility: when an alkyl bromide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes an elimination reaction to form an alkene. Or perhaps it's a substitution but under different conditions.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound has a benzyl bromide structure, and under these conditions, it undergoes elimination to form a benzene with a substituent that's now an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an allylic bromide, leading to elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzyl halide, and the reaction is a substitution. But I'm not entirely sure yet. Let's first try to figure out the structure of Compound X.

So, back to the NMR. The aromatic region (8.0 ppm, d, 2H and 7.2 ppm, d, 2H) suggests two sets of doublets, each integrating for two protons. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, each being a substituent with two protons. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single substituent that's a group attached to the benzene, which itself has two substituents leading to the two doublets.

Wait, another thought. The aromatic protons could be part of a substituent attached to the benzene. For example, if the benzene has a substituent like a propenoate group, but that might not fit the other data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Let's think about a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached. So, benzaldehyde would have an aldehyde proton around 9-10 ppm, but in this NMR, it's at 10.5 ppm, which is a bit higher. Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H, which could be an aldehyde, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which doesn't fit with an aldehyde. Aldehydes typically have a peak around 2800 cm^-1 for the C-H stretch (the doublet around 2800 and 2720 in the IR), and the carbonyl around 1710 cm-1. So, 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, which could shift the peak higher.

Wait, another option: the 10.5 ppm peak is a carboxylic acid. Then the IR would have a strong O-H stretch (broad) around 3000-2500, and a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. But this IR has 1720, which is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Maybe it's an ester, which has a higher carbonyl peak.

Let me try to draw a possible structure. Let's say the benzene has a substituent that's a carbonyl group attached to a chain. For example, maybe it's a benzene ring with a -CO-R group attached, where R is some alkyl chain.

Looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH next to a carbonyl. Then 1.7 (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups, and 1.4 (d, 3H) a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is benzene with a -CO-CH2-C(CH3)- group? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group adjacent to a CH. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is the CH attached to the methyl. The 1.7 (m,2H) could be another CH2 group. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, like an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps it's a structure like benzene with a -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group? Or maybe the chain is more like -COCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't fit the NMR data for the CH groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone, like benzophenone, but the NMR doesn't fit that. Or perhaps a benzene ring with a propionyl group attached.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows a methyl group as a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which implies it's attached to a CH2. So perhaps it's part of an ethyl group, like -CH2CH2CH3. Let's see: the 0.9 t (3H) is the end of an ethyl chain. Then the 1.7 m (2H) would be the CH2 next to the ethyl, and the 2.9 m (1H) could be a CH group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a -COCH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me think: the carbonyl (CO) would then be attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2CH3. Hmm, that might fit.

But how does that fit with the aromatic protons? So, if the benzene has a substituent like -COCH2CH(CH2CH3), then the aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern, hence the doublets. So the benzene is para-substituted, and the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a chain.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is 4-(propan-2-yl)benzoic acid. Let me think about that. Benzoic acid would have a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene. If the substituent is at the para position, and the substituent is a propan-2-yl group (like isopropyl), then the NMR would show a singlet for the methyl groups attached to the branching point. But the NMR here shows a triplet at 0.9, which is the end of an ethyl group. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a butyl group attached via a carbonyl. Let's think about the NMR data:

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a CH group that's probably next to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the end of an ethyl group (CH2CH3). So putting this together, the chain would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO- attached to benzene.

Wait, maybe the structure is benzene with a substituent like -CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, that would make the chain:

Benzene ring attached to a carbonyl (CO), then a CH2, then a CH that's attached to a CH2CH3. So the chain is propyl with a branch?

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone, like benzaldehyde, but that doesn't explain all the NMR peaks. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propanoyl group (CH2CO-) attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the aromatic region has doublets, which suggests that the substituent is in the para position. So perhaps the
