Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, which is 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs, right? So each particle has a charge of 2 * 1.602e-19 C. So that's 3.204e-19 C per particle.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Oh, right, the potential energy in an electrostatic system is the work done to assemble the charges. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy of all the pairs of charges.

Wait, but since the system is isolated, the energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m away. So the 13th charge interacts with each of the 12 others, right?

So let me think. The 13th charge is at P, and each of the 12 others is 2m from P. So each of those 12 is distance r=2m from the central charge.

But that's only part of the story. The 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but are any of them close to each other? The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. It doesn't specify their distance from each other. Hmm, so I think I need to consider their mutual interactions as well.

Wait, but if all 12 are at the same distance from P, but their positions aren't specified relative to each other, maybe they form a symmetrical arrangement, like the surface of a sphere. So the distance between any two charges among the 12 would be the same? Or is that an assumption I can make?

Wait, but maybe the problem is simplified, and the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are not considered. Because if I don't know their exact positions, it's hard to calculate their mutual potential. But the question asks for the minimum energy, which might imply the configuration with the least potential energy. Hmm.

Wait a second, in a system of charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. But since 12 are fixed at 2m from P and the 13th is at P, the mutual potential between the 12 charges would be a function of how they're arranged. But perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are point charges located at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not given. So perhaps, for the purposes of this problem, I'm only supposed to calculate the potential due to the central charge and the 12 surrounding charges, not their mutual interactions.

Wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So I have to find the configuration that gives the minimum possible potential energy. Since potential energy is related to the work done to bring the charges together, minimizing it would mean arranging the charges in a way that the repulsive forces do the least work.

But in this setup, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at 2m from P. So, perhaps their mutual distances are also 2m apart? Wait, no. If they're constrained to be at 2m from P, their arrangement could vary. For example, if they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, the distance between any two adjacent charges would be determined by the number of charges. But for 12 charges, which is a lot, the angle between them would be small, so the distance between two adjacent charges would be approximately 2m as well, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are much larger, but that's not given.

Wait
