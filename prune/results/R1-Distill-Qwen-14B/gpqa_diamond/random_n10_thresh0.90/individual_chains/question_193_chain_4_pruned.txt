Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are about different dependencies on r, like r cubed, r to the fifth, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I think is distance d is approximately equal to 1 over parallax plx, but in parsecs or something. Oh right, the formula is d = 1 / plx, where d is in parsecs and plx is in arcseconds. So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. So I think they're asking about the number of stars per unit distance interval, which would be the derivative of N with respect to d, maybe.

Wait, let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the derivative of N with respect to d multiplied by dr. So dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But wait, the question is phrased a bit differently. It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps they're looking for dN/dr, which is the number per unit distance.

If N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would go as d^4. But the options are in terms of r. Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of how N depends on r. So the number of stars in a certain range of distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number density, which is the number per unit volume.
