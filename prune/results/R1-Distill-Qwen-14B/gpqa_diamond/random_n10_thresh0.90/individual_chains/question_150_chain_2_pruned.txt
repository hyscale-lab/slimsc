Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get a bit tricky. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then there are three reagents used in sequence. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options given.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to understand the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let's interpret each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high ppm value, which often suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually appear around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is an aldehyde group.

Next, the peak at 6.98 ppm is a doublet with 2H. This could be aromatic protons. If it's a doublet, perhaps it's part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para-substituted rings, the protons are usually split into a doublet when there's another substituent. Wait, but let me think again. In para substitution, the protons are equivalent, so maybe in a coupling situation, but perhaps I'm mixing things up.

The 6.51 ppm is also a doublet with 2H. Hmm, that's another aromatic region. Maybe this is a different substituent on the benzene ring? Or perhaps it's part of another aromatic system, like a meta-substituted ring? Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group or something else.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet with 2H. Broad peaks can indicate exchange with protons, like -OH groups, but wait, this is a singlet. Alternatively, it might be a conjugated system, such as an enol or an aromatic ring with substituents causing coupling that averages to a singlet. Or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic group where the protons are equivalent and not split much.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet with 2H. That's in the range for CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen. So maybe it's a CH2 next to an oxygen, like OCH2 or something similar. The doublet suggests coupling with another set of protons.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group, an aromatic ring, another aromatic ring (since I see two sets of aromatic protons), and some CH2 groups.

Wait, but let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen.

Wait, the molecular formula could correspond to a structure with an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and maybe an oxygen elsewhere like an ether or an alcohol.

But given the NMR data, maybe the aldehyde is part of a butyraldehyde structure, but with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diphenyl compound. Let me think about the substituents.

Wait, the 9.72 ppm is the aldehyde proton. So that's an aldehyde group.

The peaks at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm could be from two different aromatic rings. For instance, if the molecule has two benzene rings attached to a central chain.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a diaryl compound, like diphenylbutanal or something similar. Because the aldehyde would account for the 9.72 peak. Then the aromatic protons would come from the two benzene rings.

But let's think about the coupling. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doubletsâ€”each with 2H. That suggests that each of these is a pair of equivalent protons on an aromatic ring. So, perhaps each is part of a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if each ring has a substituent
