Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. But one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the brightness variations will look like those caused by an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same light curve amplitude as these spots. So the question is, what's the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius?

Wait, but wait. The problem says "if the star was not covered by spots!" So we're comparing the brightness variation from a planet to the variation from the spots. I need to compute the relative brightness change (the amplitude) in both cases and set them equal.

First, let's understand what each scenario does to the star's light.

When there's a planet transiting the star, the observed brightness drops because part of the star is blocked. The amplitude of this dip is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, since the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star.

In the case of the starspots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star appears dimmer. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The brightness variation due to spots is a bit more complicated.

But wait, the filling factor is given as 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, does that affect how much the brightness varies as the star rotates? Hmm. Let me think. The star is being observed, and as it rotates, the spots come into view. The maximum effect would be when the spot area is fully visible, which is when the rotation brings them into the observer's line of sight.

But wait, the star has one hemisphere with spots. So since it's a hemisphere, which is half the star's surface. The filling factor within that hemisphere is 20%—so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere). The area of a hemisphere is 2πR², so the spot area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². So the filling factor overall is 0.4πR² /4πR² = 0.1 or 10%? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So each hemisphere's surface is 2πR², and 20% of that is covered. So the spots' area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the overall filling factor (fraction of the star's surface covered) is (0.4πR²)/4πR²) = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface area.

But wait, when the star rotates, we see the spots come into view and then go out of view. The
