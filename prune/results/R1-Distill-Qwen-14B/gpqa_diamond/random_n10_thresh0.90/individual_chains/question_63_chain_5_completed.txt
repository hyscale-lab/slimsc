Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it says. Oh right, it's about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model. The question is about the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state. 

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state. But wait, the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, right, that sounds like the next state in the vibrational energy level. Or maybe a combination of rotation and vibration? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So, the molecule is X and Y, X has a mass of 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. Bond length R is 2 angstroms. Angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are various momenta, so I need to calculate which one it is.

I think the model they're referring to is the rotation-vibration model, which combines rotational and vibrational energy levels. But wait, the question is about the transition when the molecule absorbs a photon. So I guess the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states.

Wait, but what's the initial state? The fundamental state of the molecule. In the rotation-vibration model, the states are labeled by quantum numbers. For vibration, the fundamental state is n=0. For rotation, the fundamental is J=0. So perhaps the molecule is in the (n=0, J=0) state. When it absorbs a photon, it can either go to a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But the problem specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, which transition would give the lowest energy increment?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational, I think. Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing based on the force constant, while rotational spacing is based on the moment of inertia. Let me recall the formulas.

The energy levels for vibration are E_n = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. So the transition from n=0 to n=1 would require a photon energy of h w.

For rotation, the energy is E_J = (J (J+1) ħ²) / (2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. The spacing between J and J+1 depends on the value of J. For J=0 to J=1, the energy difference would be E_1 - E_0 = [ (2)(3) - 0 ] * (something), but I'm not sure exactly. But I think that the rotational energy spacing is smaller than the vibrational spacing. So perhaps the molecule would undergo a vibrational transition first, but the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, no— the question is about the photon causing a transition to the next possible state, which could be either rotational or vibrational.

Wait, but the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. To get the next state with the lowest possible energy, I think the next available state is the first vibrational excited state, n=1, because that's a higher energy than any rotational state. Wait, no, wait. Because for a diatomic, the rotational energy levels are spaced closer together than the vibrational. So maybe the next state is a rotational transition, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, which is n=0, and the molecule transitions to n=1. But in that case, the photon must supply the vibrational energy h w. But what about the rotational part? Because in the rotation-vibration model, the total energy is the sum of rotation and vibration.

Wait, the question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. So the fundamental state is the lowest energy, which is when both rotation and vibration are in their lowest states. So n=0, J=0. The next possible state would be the next higher state, which could be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. Which of these has the lower energy?

I need to calculate both possible transitions and see which one requires a lower photon energy. Because the question is about the lowest possible energy, that would correspond to the lower energy transition.

So, let's compute both possibilities.

First, the vibrational transition: from n=0 to n=1. The energy difference is h w. Because E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the difference between n=0 and n=1 is (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2) h w = h w.

Second, the rotational transition: from J=0 to J=1. The rotational energy is E_rot = [ J (J+1) ] * (ħ²/(2 I)), where I is the moment of inertia.

So, E_J=1 - E_J=0 = (2 * 3 - 0 * 1) * (ħ²/(2 I)) ? Wait, no, E_J is proportional to J(J+1). So for J=1, E_rot = 2 * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). For J=0, E_rot =0. So the energy difference is E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) * (2) = ħ²/(I) ?

Wait, let me think again. The formula is E_J = (J (J+1) ) * (ħ²)/(2 I). So when J=0, E_J = 0. When J=1, E_J = (2) * ħ²/(2I) = ħ²/(I). So the difference is ħ²/(I).

So, the photon's energy must match either the vibrational energy (h w) or the rotational energy (ħ²/(I)).

I need to compute both and see which is smaller.

But wait, the given parameters are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but the moment of inertia I is μ R². R is 2 angstroms. So let's compute I.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let me compute that.

1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3.018. So 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R=2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, h/(2π), which is about 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So, ħ²/(I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (1.207e-46)

Let me compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (since 1e-34 squared is 1e-68, and (1.05)^2≈1.1025)

So numerator is ~1.112e-68 J² s².

Divide by denominator 1.207e-46:

1.112e-68 / 1.207e-46 ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference E_rot is about 9.21e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h w. h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. w is 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vib = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, comparing the two: E_rot is 9.21e-23 J, E_vib is 2.65e-19 J. So E_rot is much smaller. So the photon would need to provide the lower energy, which is E_rot, for the transition J=0→J=1.

But wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. So perhaps it's in the lowest vibrational and rotational state. So if it absorbs a photon, it can either go to n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next possible state.

But wait, the question is about the photon momentum. Because the photon's energy is E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E/(c).

Wait, no, E = h f = p c, so p = E/c. So I can calculate p for the rotational transition.

E_rot = 9.21e-23 J. So p = 9.21e-23 / (3e8) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are that small. Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, these are in Ns, which is kg m/s. But my calculation gave about 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. None of the options are anywhere near that. So I must have done something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the vibrational transition. Let's compute p for the vibrational case.

E_vib = 2.65e-19 J. So p = E_vib / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, D is 1.4e-28. But 8.8e-28 isn't an option. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy again. Let me recalculate E_vib:

h=6.626e-34 J s. w=4e14 rad/s. So E_vib = h w = (6.626e-34) * (4e14) = 2.65e-19 J. So that's correct.

Hmm, but the options don't include that. Wait, maybe the question is about the transition from the (v=0, J=0) state to (v=0, J=1), which is a purely rotational transition. Or perhaps I misunderstood the model and the energy levels are considered as a combination.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels in the rotation-vibration model are a product of the vibrational and rotational energies. So the total energy is E_total = E_vib + E_rot. So perhaps the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0), and the next state is (v=0, J=1), which has higher energy than (v=1, J=0). So which one has lower energy?

Wait, let's compute both.

E_vib (n=1, J=0) is h w = 2.65e-19 J.

E_rot (n=0, J=1) is 9.21e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy, so that's the next state.

But the photon's momentum for the rotational transition would be 9.21e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = ~3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger than that. So maybe I messed up the energy calculation for rotation.

Let me recheck the rotational energy calculation.

I think I made a mistake in calculating ħ squared.

Wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R².

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

1 amu is 1.660539e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.660539e-27 kg ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So E_rot (J=1) = (1*(1+1)) * ħ²/(2I) = 2 * (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2072e-46) ) 

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator.

Wait, E_rot = [ J (J+1) ] * (ħ²) / (2 I) 

So for J=1: 2 * (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2072e-46) )

Simplify:

The 2s cancel, so (1.112e-68) / (1.2072e-46) ≈ 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, that's what I had earlier. So that's correct.

So then, the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J, which gives p = E/c ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger, so perhaps I've mixed up something.

Wait, perhaps the model expects the transition to be a vibrational one, not a rotational one. Because maybe the question is only considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational.

The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That suggests the transition requires the least energy. So the rotational transition is lower energy, but perhaps the problem expects the molecule to transition to the next vibrational state regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the fundamental state, which is when both vibrational and rotational are at their lowest. When the molecule absorbs a photon, the next possible state could involve a change in either vibration or rotation. But the problem says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one with the smallest energy increment, which is the rotational transition.

But since that gives a p of ~3e-31 Ns, which isn't among the options, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy levels as combining both rotational and vibrational, but in a way that the next state is a vibrational one. Because sometimes in molecules, the vibrational transitions are accompanied by rotational changes, but maybe here it's a pure vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Or maybe I'm applying the wrong model.

Wait, the problem states it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is a non-rigid rotor. So it's a combination of both.

Hmm, perhaps the photon must cause a transition that includes both vibrational and rotational changes. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the energy of the photon as the energy difference between the vibrational levels, which is more significant than the rotational.

Wait, perhaps the given options are for the vibrational transition. Let me recompute the photon momentum for the vibrational case.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 / (3e8) = ~8.83e-28 kg m/s = 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, none of them match. The closest is option A) 1.9e-28, which is about half of that. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the rotational energy using the actual formula correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moment of inertia.

Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (20 * 2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈1.818 amu. 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg = approx 3e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m. So I = μ R^2 = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s. So ħ squared is (1.05e-34)^2 ≈ 1.1e-68 J² s².

So the rotational energy E_rot for J=1 is (1*(1+1)) * ħ^2/(2I) = 2 * (1.1e-68) / (2 * 1.2e-46) ) = (2.2e-68) / (2.4e-46) ) = approx 9.17e-23 J.

So p = E_rot / c = 9.17e-23 / 3e8 = ~3.06e-31 kg m/s → 3.06e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are close. So perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. So let's re-examine that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J. Divide by 3e8 gives 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, none match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me check again.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = ?

6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626 *4 = 26.504, and exponents: 1e-34 *1e14 = 1e-20. So 26.504e-20 → 2.6504e-19 J. That's correct.

So p = 2.65e-19 / (3e8) = (2.65/3) * 1e-27 → 0.883e-27 → 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem is considering the energy difference between the next vibrational state and the current state, but including some rotational changes?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the translational energy, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid rotor. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the formula p = h/(lambda), but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels for the rotation-vibration model are given by E = E_vib + E_rot. So the fundamental state is (v=0, J=0). The next higher state could be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). Which of these has lower energy?

Compute E_vib = h w = 2.65e-19 J.

Compute E_rot = (J=1 case) = 9.21e-23 J.

So the rotational transition requires less energy, so it's the next state. But as before, the photon's momentum is 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the vibrational part, not the rotational. Maybe the transition is purely vibrational.

But why would the problem mention the rotation-vibration model then? Maybe the question is about the fundamental vibrational state, and the molecule is in the ground vibrational state, but with some rotational state. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be (v=1, J=0), which is a pure vibrational transition. In that case, the photon's energy is h w, and the momentum p is E/c.

So, p = (h w)/c → (6.626e-34 * 4e14) / 3e8 = (2.65e-19) / (3e8) = 8.83e-28 kg m/s. That's approximately 8.8e-28 Ns, but the options don't have this. So I'm at a loss.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me check the units again.

Wait, angular frequency w is given in rad/s. So E = hbar w, not h w. Oh! Wait, that's a crucial mistake.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) hbar w. So the energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is hbar w.

Wait, I used h instead of hbar. That's a big mistake. Because I think I was calculating E_vib as h w, but it should be hbar * w.

Wait, that changes everything. Because ħ = h/(2π). So E_vib = ħ w = (h/(2π)) * w.

So let me recalculate E_vib.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

So ħ w = (6.626e-34 / 6.283) ) *4e14 → approximately (1.05e-34) *4e14 =4.2e-20 J?

Wait, 6.626e-34 / (2 pi) is approximately 1.05e-34, and multiplying by 4e14:

1.05e-34 *4e14 =4.2e-20 J.

So E_vib =4.2e-20 J.

Then, the photon's momentum p = E/c =4.2e-20 / 3e8 =1.4e-28 kg m/s → 1.4e-28 Ns.

Hmm, that's option D.

But wait, that's the rotational transition I thought earlier? No, because earlier the rotational transition was E_rot=9.21e-23 J, which is much larger than 4.2e-20 J. Wait, no, 9e-23 is much smaller than 4e-20. So E_rot is 9e-23, which is less than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition would have a lower energy, which would be the next state.

But wait, if the vibrational transition requires 4.2e-20 J (p=1.4e-28 Ns), which is option D. But the rotational transition requires 9.21e-23 J, which is p ~3e-31 Ns.

Wait, but if the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition, then it should be the next state. But according to this calculation, the vibrational transition's photon momentum is 1.4e-28, which is option D. But why is the rotational transition not considered?

Wait, perhaps the question is only about the vibrational transition, but that doesn't make sense because the model includes both. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where the photon's energy provides enough to increase both the vibrational and rotational state. But that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the vibration part, which uses hbar w instead of h w.

So if I made a mistake earlier in the vibrational energy, the correct photon momentum is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

So the answer would be D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational and rotational energy levels: \(v = 0, J = 0\). The next possible state with the lowest energy could involve either a vibrational transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)) or a rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)).

### Key Parameters:
- \(M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu}\)
- Bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\)
- Angular frequency of vibration \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\)

### Step 1: Reduced Mass and Moment of Inertia
The reduced mass of the molecule is calculated as:
\[
\mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
\]
Converting to kilograms:
\[
\mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
\]
The moment of inertia is:
\[
I = \mu R^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
\]

### Step 2: Energy Differences
#### Vibrational Transition (\(v = 0 \to v = 1\)):
The vibrational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_v = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]
where \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s}\). The energy difference for a vibrational transition is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{vib}} = \hbar \omega = (1.054 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
\]

#### Rotational Transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)):
The rotational energy levels are given by:
\[
E_J = \frac{J (J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}.
\]
The energy difference for a rotational transition is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_{J=1} - E_{J=0} = \frac{2 \hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
\]
Substituting values:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Photon Momentum
The photon's momentum is related to its energy by:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c},
\]
where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\).

#### For Vibrational Transition:
\[
p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
\]

#### For Rotational Transition:
\[
p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
\]

### Step 4: Selection of the Next State
The next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the smaller energy difference. Since \(\Delta E_{\text{rot}} < \Delta E_{\text{vib}}\), the rotational transition requires less energy. However, the calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\(p_{\text{rot}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}\)) does not match any of the provided options. Instead, the vibrational transition, which corresponds to \(p_{\text{vib}} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\), matches option **D**.

### Final Answer:
The photon momentum required for the molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy is approximately \(1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}\).

**Answer: D**
