Okay, so I need to figure out the mean decay distance for this meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on their lifetime and speed. Let me think about the steps involved.

First, I think I need to find the lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV, and I recall that the width is related to the lifetime via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, right? So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I need to make sure about the units here. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units involving eV·seconds or something like that.

Wait, more accurately, the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For the width Γ, which is the uncertainty in energy, Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. Let me write that down: τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But what's ħ in terms of units I can use? I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. Oh wait, let me double-check that. Planck's constant divided by 2π is ħ, and in units where c=1, but when converting to SI units, I think 1 GeV is 1.602e-10 J. Hmm, maybe I should stick with natural units for this calculation.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So, τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging the numbers, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, so τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV. Let me calculate that: 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. So τ ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. The production energy is 8 GeV, and the mass of X is 1.2 GeV. Wait, the energy is the total energy of the meson, so I can use the relativistic energy formula E = γ m c². But since we're working in units where c is 1 (like natural units), E = γ m. So γ is E / m. Plugging the numbers, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Once I have γ, I can find the velocity β. Because γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). So let's solve for β. Let me rearrange that: 1/γ² = 1 - β² → β² = 1 - 1/γ². Let me compute that. γ is 6.6667, so γ² is approximately (20/3)^2 = (400/9) ≈44.444. So 1/γ² is about 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. So β squared is 0.9775, so β is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So velocity v is approximately 0.9887c.

Wait, but I think I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute γ² exactly. 8 / 1.2 is 20/3 ≈ 6.6666667. Squared, that's (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.444444. So 1/γ² is 9/400 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is around 0.9887.

Now, to find the mean decay distance, which is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. So distance L = v * τ. But wait, I have to make sure the units are compatible. Because τ is in seconds, v is in terms of c, which is m/s. Let me see.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v = 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s. Multiply that by τ, which is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.057e-24 s) = let's compute that. 2.966 * 2.057 is approximately, let me multiply it:

2.966 * 2 ≈5.932, 2.966 * 0.057 ≈ 0.168. So total is approximately 6.100. So 6.100e(8-24) = 6.100e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 2.966e8 * 2.057e-24 more precisely.

2.966e8 = 2.966 * 1e8.

2.057e-24 = 2.057 * 1e-24.

Multiply them: (2.966 * 2.057) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (about 6.10) * 1e-16. So 6.1e-16 meters. But wait, let me calculate 2.966 * 2.057 more accurately.

2.966 * 2.057: Let's break it down.

2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.05 = 0.1483.

2.966 * 0.007= 0.020762.

Adding them: 5.932 + 0.1483 = 6.0803 + 0.020762 = 6.101062.

So approximately 6.101e-16 meters. Hmm. But none of the options are 6e-16. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m
B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m
C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m
D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Wait, none is 6e-16. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back through the steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe I messed up the calculation of the lifetime. Let me recheck that.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. And ħ is approximately 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32.

Compute 6.582 / 0.32: Let me compute that. 6.582 divided by 0.32.

0.32 * 20 = 6.4, so 6.582 is 6.4 + 0.182. So 20 + (0.182 / 0.32) → 20 + (0.182/0.32) ≈ 20 + 0.56875=20.56875.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds. So that part is correct.

Then, velocity calculation: β was sqrt(1 - 1/(γ²)). γ is 8/1.2 = 6.6666667. 1/(γ²) is 1/(44.444444). 1/44.444444 is 0.0225, as before. So 1-0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root is sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that more accurately.

What's sqrt(0.9775)? Let me think: 0.988² = 0.976144; 0.989² = 0.978121. So 0.9775 is between those. 0.988^2 = 0.976144, so 0.9775 - 0.976144=0.001356. The difference between 0.988^2 and 0.989^2 is 0.978121 -0.976144 = 0.001977. So 0.001356 / 0.001977 ≈0.685. So beta is approximately 0.988 + 0.685*(0.001) = 0.988685. So about 0.9887.

So v is 0.9887c. c is approx 3e8 m/s, so 0.9887 *3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, multiply by τ: 2.966e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = 2.966 * 2.057e-16 m.

2.966 * 2.057: Let me compute this again.

2 * 2.057 =4.114. 0.966 * 2.057 = approx 2.000 (since 0.966 is about 0.966, 2.057 * 0.966 = let's compute 2 *0.966=1.932; 0.057*0.966≈0.055; so total 1.987). So 4.114 + 1.987=6.101. So 6.101e-16 m. Hmm, but that's not any of the options.

Wait a minute, perhaps the calculation of the velocity is wrong because I should have considered the meson's momentum or maybe relativistic expressions better.

Alternative approach: The mean decay length is given by L = cτβγ. Wait, c is in m/s, τ is in seconds, so L would be in meters. Let me see.

Because lifetime τ is proper time (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), but when the particle is moving, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the lifetime is gamma * tau. So, the lifetime in lab frame is gamma * tau. Then, the distance is velocity * lifetime, which is beta c * gamma tau. So, L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, I think that's correct. So, L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Wait, let me recheck the formula. The proper lifetime is tau, so the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. The distance is speed (v = beta c) multiplied by the lab frame lifetime (gamma tau). So L = beta c * gamma tau.

Alternatively, L = beta gamma c tau.

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps I should compute it as L = beta gamma c tau.

So, let me compute each factor.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Beta is 0.9887.

c is 3e8 m/s.

tau is 2.057e-24 s.

So, L = 0.9887 * 6.6667 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24.

Wait, let me compute the constants first.

0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ let's compute that. 6.6667 * 0.9887 is approximately 6.6667*(1 - 0.0113) ≈ 6.6667 - 0.0753 = 6.5914.

So, 6.5914 * 3e8 = 1.9774e9.

Then multiply by tau: 1.9774e9 * 2.057e-24 = (1.9774 * 2.057) * 1e-15.

1.9774 * 2.057: Let me compute 2 * 1.9774=3.9548, 0.057 *1.9774≈0.1123 → total ≈4.0671. So 4.0671e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15. So 4.067 is close to 4.0655. So option B is that.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate 1.9774 * 2.057 more accurately.

1.9774 * 2.057:

Break it down:

2 * 1.9774 = 3.9548.

0.05 * 1.9774 = 0.09887.

0.007 * 1.9774 = 0.0138418.

Adding them together: 3.9548 + 0.09887 =4.05367 + 0.0138418=4.06751.

So, approximately 4.0675e-15 m.

So option B is 4.0655e-15, which is very close. The discrepancy is likely due to more precise values in the constants.

So the correct answer should be option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, but earlier I thought the calculation was leading me to 6e-16, but that was a different approach. So perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach not considering the correct formula.

So let's recap:

L = beta * gamma * c * tau.

Which is beta * gamma * c * (ħ / (Gamma)).

Wait, what's the exact formula for mean decay length?

Yes, I think the correct formula is L = (c * gamma * beta) * tau.

Which is:

L = c * gamma * beta * tau.

Alternatively, L = c * gamma * beta * (ħ / (Gamma)).

Wait, but in our calculation, we have:

c = 3e8 m/s.

gamma = 6.6667.

beta = 0.9887.

tau = 2.057e-24 s.

So, L = 3e8 * 6.6667 * 0.9887 * 2.057e-24.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, 3e8 * 6.6667 = 3e8 * (20/3) = (3 * 20/3) e8 = 20e8 = 2e9.

Then, 2e9 * 0.9887 = 1.9774e9.

Then, 1.9774e9 * 2.057e-24 = 1.9774 *2.057e-15.

Which is approximately 4.067e-15 m, as before.

So, the correct answer is option B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the mean decay length:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \) (proper lifetime)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \) (Lorentz factor)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \) (velocity as a fraction of \( c \))
The velocity \( \beta \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.667 \), we calculate:

\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{20}{3} \right)^2 \approx 44.444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.0225, \quad \beta^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = \beta \gamma c \tau \):

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau = (0.9887)(6.667)(3 \times 10^8)(2.057 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
\beta \gamma = (0.9887)(6.667) \approx 6.591.
\]

Next, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8)(2.057 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.171 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Finally, calculate \( L \):

\[
L = (6.591)(6.171 \times 10^{-16}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

Answer: B
