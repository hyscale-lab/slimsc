Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when things move relative to each other, their velocities add up according to special relativity. But wait, this is a glass moving, so the speed of light in the glass is different.

Let me think. The question says the glass has an index of refraction n. The speed of light in a medium is usually c divided by n. But wait, c is the speed in a vacuum, right? So normally, in the glass, the speed would be v_glass = c/n. But since the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the lab, watching this setup. So the light is moving relative to the glass, but the glass itself is moving relative to the lab. I think I need to use some sort of velocity addition here.

Wait, in classical mechanics, velocities just add up. So if the glass is moving at v and the light in the glass is moving at v_glass, then the lab frame would see the light moving at v_glass + v. But wait, that might not be right because light speed is supposed to be constant in all frames according to Einstein. So maybe that approach is wrong.

Wait, no. Because the light is inside the glass, which is moving. So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but when the glass is moving, how does that affect the lab's measurement?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the frames of reference. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed c/n. But how does that transform to the lab frame?

No, wait. Another approach: The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But when the medium (glass here) is moving, does the speed of light in the medium change? Or is it the speed relative to the medium that's c/n, and the medium's movement affects the lab's measurement?

I think it's the latter. So the speed of light relative to the glass is c/n. But the glass is moving at v in the lab. So the lab would measure the speed of light as the sum of the glass's speed and the light's speed relative to the glass. Wait, but that's only in classical mechanics. But in reality, relativity comes into play, right?

Wait, no. Because the speed of light can't exceed c,
