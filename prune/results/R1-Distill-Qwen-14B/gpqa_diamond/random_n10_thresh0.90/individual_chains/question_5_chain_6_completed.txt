Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum. Oh wait, yes, the Pauli matrices! Because the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given as ħ/2 times some 2x2 matrices. So I think each of these components corresponds to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Let me write down what each component is:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

The operator for the direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π, so maybe θ is the angle from the z-axis? Or perhaps since it's in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented with θ being the angle with the x-axis? Hmm, I might be mixing things up, but I think the general form of the operator when you have a direction n is P · n, where n is a unit vector. So the operator is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). Because in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n can be written as (a, 0, b), where a² + b² = 1. Let me denote n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, actually, since in the x-z plane, it's more natural to use θ as the angle from the z-axis. So n = (sinθ * cosφ, 0, sinθ * sinφ), but wait, no, wait, in x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so perhaps φ is zero or π? Or maybe I'm complicating. Let me think: for any direction in x-z plane, the vector can be represented as (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P·n is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n_y is zero.

Wait, but wait, P is the vector operator, so P = (P_x, P_y, P_z). So P·n would be sum over i of n_i P_i. So yeah, since n_y is zero, only P_x and P_z contribute.

So I need to compute the matrix for P·n. Let's compute that.

P·n = n_x * P_x + n_z * P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

n_x P_x is (ħ/2) * n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]]
n_z P_z is (ħ/2) * n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So adding them together:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z * 1, n_x * 1],
                [n_x * 1, (-n_z) * 1 ] ]

Wait, let me double-check:

The first row:

[ (n_z)(1) , (n_x)(1) ]

Second row:

[ (n_x)(1) , (-n_z)(1) ]

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

But multiplied by (ħ/2). So the operator is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, but n_x and n_z are related by n_x² + n_z² = 1, since n is a unit vector.

I need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Expressed as a matrix equation:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ] * |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

I can factor out ħ/2 from both sides, so the equation simplifies to:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix equation becomes:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, writing the equations:

n_z * a + n_x * b = a  --> Equation (1)
n_x * a - n_z * b = b  --> Equation (2)

I can rearrange these equations.

From Equation (1):

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

From Equation (2):

n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

So we have a system of two equations:

1. (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

2. n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can write this as a matrix equation:

[ (n_z -1)    n_x        ] [a]   = [0]
[ n_x      -(n_z +1) ] [b]     [0]

For a non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Calculating the determinant:

(n_z -1)(- (n_z +1)) ) - (n_x)(n_x) ) = 0

Let me compute this:

= - (n_z^2 -1) - n_x^2
= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2
= -(n_x^2 +n_z^2) +1

But n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1, so:

= -(1) +1 = 0

So the determinant is zero, which makes sense because we found an eigenvalue, so the system is consistent.

So the two equations are dependent, which means we can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

Let me take equation (1):

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0

Let me solve for a in terms of b.

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b

a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] * b

But wait, n_z can be 1, but in our case, since the direction is in x-z, n_z can't be 1 unless it's along the z-axis. So perhaps we can proceed without worrying about division by zero.

But perhaps another approach is better. Let me think about the eigenvector equation.

The matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find vectors [a; b] such that when multiplied by this matrix, the result is [a; b].

So,

n_z a + n_x b = a --> (n_z -1)a + n_x b =0

n_x a - n_z b = b --> n_x a - (n_z +1)b =0

So, from the first equation:

a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] * b

Wait, if I rearrange equation1:

(n_z -1) a = -n_x b --> a = [ -n_x/(n_z -1) ] b = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b

So substituting a = (n_x / (1 - n_z)) * b into equation2:

n_x a - (n_z + 1) b =0

Substitute a:

n_x [ (n_x)/(1 -n_z) b ] - (n_z +1) b =0

Multiply through by (1 -n_z) to eliminate denominator:

n_x^2 b - (n_z +1)(1 -n_z) b =0

Factor out b [since b ≠0]:

n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(1 -n_z) ) =0

Wait, let's expand (n_z +1)(1 -n_z) = (1 +n_z)(1 -n_z) = 1 - n_z^2.

So, the equation becomes:

n_x^2 - (1 -n_z²) =0

But n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1, so n_x^2 =1 -n_z^2.

So substituting:

(1 -n_z^2) - (1 -n_z^2 ) =0 → 0=0.

Which again shows the equations are dependent. So I can choose a ratio for a and b.

Let me express a in terms of b. So a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b.

Let me write the eigenvector as [a; b] = [ (n_x/(1 -n_z)) b ; b ] = b [n_x/(1 -n_z), 1 ]

We can factor out b.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [n_x/(1 -n_z), 1 ].

But let's think about the direction in x-z plane. Since n is in x-z, it's (n_x, 0, n_z). So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ, assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. Wait, no, wait. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then perhaps n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ, with θ being the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ. Because in spherical coordinates, x = r sinθ cosφ, z = r cosθ. But when φ=0, x = r sinθ, z = r cosθ. So yes, n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the angle is θ from the z-axis, then n_x is n * cosφ * sinθ, but in our case, since it's in x-z, φ is 0 or π, so cosφ is ±1. So n_x = ±n sinθ. But n is a unit vector, so n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, assuming θ is the polar angle. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Wait, perhaps I should represent n as (n_x, 0, n_z), and n_x² + n_z² =1. Let me set n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So θ=0 would be along +z, θ=π/2 would be along +x.

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ into a and b:

a = (n_x)/(1 -n_z) * b
= [ sinθ ] / [1 - cosθ ] * b

Hmm, 1 - cosθ is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So substituting:

a = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] * b
= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b
= cot(theta/2) * b

So a = cot(theta/2) * b

So the eigenvector is [a; b] = [ cot(theta/2) * b ; b ]

We can factor out b, so the vector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But this should be normalized, so the norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

But since we are dealing with quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are typically taken as normalized.

So let me compute the normalization condition.

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = | cot(theta/2) |^2 |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ cot²(theta/2) + 1 ]

cot^2 +1 = csc²(theta/2), so |b|² * csc²(theta/2) =1

So |b| = sin(theta/2 )

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)

b = sin(theta/2 )

So the vector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait. In quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are usually written as column vectors, so the components are [a; b]. So the normalized eigenvector is:

( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, let's check the signs. Because when I had a = [n_x/(1 -n_z)] b, and n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, I had a = sinθ/(1 - cosθ) * b. Let me compute that:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]

Which simplifies to [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So a = cot(theta/2) * b.

But when I normalized, I found that b = sin(theta/2 ), so a becomes cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

Thus, the vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin-1/2 systems are often represented in the eigenbasis of some direction, and the eigenvectors are given in terms of theta and phi. But in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0, so the eigenvectors would only depend on theta.

Looking at the options provided:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I just found.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that looks more like a spherical harmonic or general spin state, but perhaps when phi is zero, it becomes (cos(theta), sin(theta)), but that's not the same as our result.

Option D includes sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which suggests specific coefficients perhaps for a different basis.

Option A is (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ ), which seems to have specific numerical factors, but why would the eigenvector have ħ in it? Because eigenvectors are dimensionless in quantum mechanics, the components are just complex numbers, not multiplied by ħ. So perhaps Option A is incorrect because it includes ħ, which has units of action.

Wait, but the options are presented as elements of the normalized eigenvector. So the eigenvectors are vectors in a 2D Hilbert space, which in this case can be represented as two-component spinors. So the components should be dimensionless, so any option with ħ as a factor is probably incorrect. So options A and D include ħ, which is wrong. So I can eliminate options A and D.

So between B and C.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I derived.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but in our case phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so e^{i phi} would be 1, making the vector (cos(theta), sin(theta)), which is different from our result.

So the correct option is C.


To calculate the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

The operator $\vec{P}$ has components:
- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$,
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$.

For a direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z,
\]
where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector, so $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$. Substituting the matrices, the operator becomes:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, we have:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:
\[
(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0, \quad n_x a - (n_z + 1)b = 0.
\]
From the first equation, solving for $a$ in terms of $b$ gives:
\[
a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b.
\]
Substituting this into the second equation confirms the consistency of the system. The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, we compute the norm:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = \left| \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \right|^2 |b|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 \left( \frac{n_x^2}{(1 - n_z)^2} + 1 \right).
\]
Using $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$, we simplify:
\[
\frac{n_x^2}{(1 - n_z)^2} + 1 = \frac{1 - n_z^2}{(1 - n_z)^2} = \frac{(1 - n_z)(1 + n_z)}{(1 - n_z)^2} = \frac{1 + n_z}{1 - n_z}.
\]
Thus, $|b| = \sqrt{\frac{1 - n_z}{1 + n_z}}$ to normalize the eigenvector. Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$ (where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis), the normalized eigenvector becomes:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:
- **Option A** includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B** represents a general spin state but does not match the derived result.
- **Option C** matches the derived normalized eigenvector $\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}$.
- **Option D** includes specific coefficients and $\hbar$, which are not consistent with the derived result.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
