Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember something about this from my studies. So, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n, right? Because in a medium, the speed is c divided by the refractive index. But wait, how does the movement of the glass affect this speed?

I think this has to do with relative motion. Since the glass is moving, the observer in the lab frame would see the light's speed differently. Oh, right, this might involve a kind of addition of velocities, but I'm not sure if it's the same as the classical velocity addition formula or something else.

Wait, the classical velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), when adding velocities. But that's for objects moving at speeds much less than c. But here, the light is already moving at speed c in the medium, so maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the frame of reference. The glass is moving, so the light's velocity as observed in the lab frame would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity relative to the glass. But wait, light's speed should always be c in any inertial frame, right?

Wait, now I'm confused. Because according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. So if the glass is moving, the light inside it would still have speed c in the lab frame. But that seems conflicting with the refractive index.

Wait no, the refractive index comes into play when considering the medium's effect on the light. So in the medium, the speed is c/n, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

Let me think again. When the medium is moving, the speed of light as measured in the lab frame might not be c. Because the medium is moving, the light's velocity relative to the lab could be a combination of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to break it down.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. Now, if the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light's propagation, we need to find the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula here. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, the classical addition doesn't work. But wait, the speed of the glass is v, which is much less than c, I suppose. But the light itself is moving at c/n in the glass's frame. Since n is typically greater than 1, c/n is less than c. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is lower than c.

Wait, but the lab frame is moving at velocity v relative to the glass frame. So, to find the speed of light in the lab frame,
