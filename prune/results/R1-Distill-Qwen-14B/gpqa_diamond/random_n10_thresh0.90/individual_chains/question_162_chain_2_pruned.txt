Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and calculating the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's only in x and y. So the space described by this metric is 2D, right? But a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface in some higher-dimensional space, I guess. Or wait, maybe in this context, the pseudosphere is just a model of hyperbolic space?

Wait, I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere often refers to a space with constant negative curvature. The metric given here might be representing a hyperbolic space. So the metric is probably of the form that describes hyperbolic geometry.

The general form for a two-dimensional hyperbolic metric in coordinates x and y is something like ds² = (dr² + dz²) / (some function). Oh wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of Poincaré coordinates. The Poincaré disk model has a metric like ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)^2] (dx² + dy²), right? But that's for a unit pseudosphere, I think. Because the curvature is -1 in that case.

Wait, in the Poincaré disk model, the line element is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y². So that would be for a hyperbolic plane with curvature -1. But our metric here is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, let me compare that.

Let me factor 32 as 16*2. So 32 is 4² * 2? Wait, 4² is 16, so 16 * 2 is 32. So 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) ) = 32/(4 (1 - (r²)/4)) ) where r² = x² + y². So that simplifies to (32/4) * [1/(1 - (r²)/4)].

Wait, 32 divided by 4 is 8, so 8/(1 - r²/4). So the metric becomes [8/(1 - (r²)/(4))] (dx² + dy²). But in the Poincaré model, the metric is [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), which for 2D is (4/(1 - r²)^2) times the flat metric in polar coordinates. But our case is in cartesian coordinates and looks a bit different.

Wait, but perhaps I can make a coordinate transformation to see. Let's say u = r², then the denominator becomes 1 - u/(4) = (4 - u)/4. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps a scaling of the coordinates?

Wait, the denominator in the given metric is (4 - x² - y²), which is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So that's 4(1 - (r²/4)).

So the given metric is (32/(4(1 - r²/4))) (dx² + dy²).

Simplify 32/4: that's 8. So the metric is [8/(1 - r²/4)] (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - (r²/4)) * (dx² + dy²). Wait, but comparing to the standard Poincaré metric, which is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, maybe I'm not comparing apples to apples because they're in different coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps a change of variables. Let me consider substituting r' such that r² = 4 sinh²(something), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps scaling the coordinates.

Wait, perhaps the given metric can be seen as a scaled version of the Poincaré disk metric. Let me see: the Poincaré disk metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²) for curvature -1. But our metric is [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - r²/4) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks similar to a scaled Poincaré metric but with a different curvature.

Wait, perhaps the given metric represents a space with curvature not -1 but another value. The general form for a hyperbolic metric in the Poincaré disk is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²) when the curvature is -1. So if we have a different denominator, that would change the curvature.

In our case, the denominator is (4 - r²) = 4(1 - r²/4). So [32/(4 - r²)] = 8/(1 - r²/4). So the metric is 8/(1 - (r²/4)) (dx² + dy²). So comparing to Poincaré, which is 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). Let's see, but perhaps we can make a substitution like r' = r/2 or something.

Let me try substituting r = 2u, where u is the new radial coordinate. So r = 2u → u = r/2. Then r² = (2u)^2 =4u².

So the denominator in our metric becomes 4 -4u² =4(1 - u²). So [32/(4(1 - u²))] = 8/(1 - u²).

The metric in terms of u is [8/(1 - u²)] (dx² + dy²). But wait, dx² + dy² is in terms of the original coordinates. If our substitution is r = 2u, then in polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ → x = 2u cosθ, y = 2u sinθ.

Wait, perhaps I should express dx and dy in terms of du and dθ.

Wait, maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So the metric becomes:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

So it's [32/(4 - r²)] dr² + [32 r²/(4 - r²)] dθ²
