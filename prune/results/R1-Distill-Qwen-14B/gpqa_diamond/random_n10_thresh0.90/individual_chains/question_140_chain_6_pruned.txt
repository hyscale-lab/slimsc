Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is close to 0 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. So B is probably a solid at room temperature and melts just above that.

The first part talks about the reaction between X and Y. I'm thinking maybe it's a common reaction. The release of gas W suggests some kind of decomposition or displacement reaction. Since the gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, let's think about possible gases. For example, hydrogen gas (H2) has one proton and one neutron per molecule, but wait, each H atom has one proton. So H2 would have 2 protons and depending on isotopes, maybe neutrons. Well, if it's regular H2 (protium), each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since each H atom is just a proton and an electron). Wait, no, that's not possible because a molecule would have two atoms, each with one proton. So each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But the problem says the same number of protons and neutrons, so that can't be H2. Maybe another gas.

What about CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 neutrons (C has 6, O has 8 each; 12 + 16*2 = 44, so 44-22=22 neutrons? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, for CO2, each molecule: carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8 each. So total protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: Carbon-12 has 6, oxygen is 16 each (so 8 each, so 16-8=8 per O). So 6 + (8*2)*8? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons should be the same. So let's think about possible gases.

Another option, maybe NH3? No, because NH3 is a gas but under certain conditions. Alternatively, O2? O2 has 16 protons (each O has 8, two atoms make 16). Neutrons: each O is 8, so 16 in total. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That matches! So gas W is O2. Wait, but O2 is diatomic, so yes. But wait, when would O2 be released in a reaction? Maybe in a decomposition reaction.

But wait, that's just one possibility. Let's think of other gases. Maybe N2? Each N atom has 7 protons, so N2 would have 14 protons. Neutrons: each N is (14-7=7, so 14 neutrons total in N2). So 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? No, that's a gas but the numbers don't match. Let's think about what the reaction could be. X reacts with Y, perhaps an acid or base. The precipitate G forms, which upon heating gives B. What's B? Since melting point is ~277 K, it's about 4°C. So B is a solid that melts at 4°C. Hmm, which solid? Maybe something like water ice? No, because water's melting point is 273 K (0°C). But 277 is a bit higher. Hmm. Maybe another substance. Alternatively, maybe B is something else.

Wait, the precipitate G when heated releases B. Let's think of a reaction where a precipitate forms upon mixing two solutions. For example, maybe a metal hydroxide precipitating. When heated, it decomposes. Like, say, copper hydroxide, which when heated gives copper oxide and water. But that would release water as a gas, but in the problem, gas W is released. Wait, maybe when X reacts with Y, which is perhaps an acid, giving a metal hydroxide precipitate. Upon heating, the hydroxide decomposes into metal oxide (B) and water. But then gas W would be H2O or something else.

Wait, the problem says when X reacts with Y, it releases gas W. If it's a metal reacting with an acid, the gas could be H2. But earlier I thought that doesn't work because H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. But the problem states that W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe W is something else. What about CO? Carbon monoxide. Each molecule has one C and one O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons: 14. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's C-12), O has 8 (if it's O-16). So 6 +8 =14, same as protons. So CO would fit. So the gas W is CO. That could be a possibility.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? No, protons are 6*2? Wait, no. Methane has 1 C and 4 H. Protons: 6 + 4 = 10. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6 + 0 =6. So 10 protons and 6 neutrons—doesn't match.

Wait, another thought. If the gas is something like NO, what's that? NO has 14 protons (7+7). Neutrons: N has 14-7=7, O has 16-8=8. So 7+8=15. So protons 14, neutrons 15. Not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something with a molecule where the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons. Let's think about possible diatomic gases. For example, O2: each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits. So gas W is O2. But why would O2 be released in a reaction? Maybe in a decomposition reaction of some peroxide.

Wait, but if X is a peroxide, maybe Y is an acid. Hmm. Alternatively, if X is a metal, and Y is an acid, the reaction could produce H2 gas. But wait, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons, which doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.

Let me think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has 2 oxygen atoms. So, perhaps X is a base or something that deprotonates the keto acid. Keto acids are like beta-keto acids, which can undergo decarboxylation. For example, when a beta-keto acid reacts with a base, it can lose CO2 and form a ketone.

Wait, if X is a strong base, like NaOH or KOH, reacting with a keto acid would deprotonate it, leading to the loss of CO2. So the product would have fewer oxygen atoms. Wait, but the product contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, and the reaction is an acid-base reaction. Alternatively, maybe X is something else entirely.

Let's get back to the initial reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. If B has a melting point near 277 K, that's about 4°C. So perhaps B is a metal that's solid at 4°C. Or perhaps it's something else like ammonium chloride? No, that's a different melting point.

Another thought: when a metal reacts with an acid, you get H2 gas. But the problem states that W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So H2 doesn't fit. So maybe the reaction isn't a metal and acid. What else reacts violently with a liquid? Maybe an alkali metal reacting with water, releasing H2. But again, that doesn't fit the W condition.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a carbonate reacting with an acid. For example, if Y is HCl, and X is a carbonate. The reaction would produce CO2 gas. But CO2's molecule: 6 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. Protons: 6 + 16*2 = 6 +32=38? Wait, no, each CO2 molecule has 22 protons. Wait, C has 6, each O has 8. So 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Each C is 12 (assuming C-12) which has 6 neutrons. Each O is 16 (O-16), which has 8 neutrons. So per CO2 molecule, total neutrons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Same as protons. So yes, CO2 fits as W. So gas W is CO2.

So if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, the reaction produces CO2, and a precipitate. Hmm. What precipitate would form when a carbonate reacts with an acid? Maybe if the acid is in excess, but if the carbonate is soluble, perhaps it's a different reaction. Alternatively, if Y is a base, perhaps a different scenario.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a metal carbonate reacting with a strong acid, it produces CO2 gas, metal salt, and water. But the precipitate would imply that the product isn't soluble. So maybe if Y is a weak acid, and X is a metal carbonate that is only slightly soluble, the reaction could produce a precipitate of the corresponding metal hydroxide if the solution becomes basic. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite, and reacts with an acid to produce SO2 gas. But SO2 has 16 protons (S=16, O=8 each; 16 + 16 =32 protons. Neutrons: S-32 has 16, O-16 has 8 each. So 16 + 8*2=32. So 32 protons and 32 neutrons. That fits. So W could be SO2. So gas W is SO2, which would suggest X is a sulfite or something similar.

But I'm not certain yet. Let me think about the precipitate. The precipitate G when heated gives B. If B is a metal oxide, perhaps. For example, if G is a metal hydroxide, heating it would dehydrate it to form the oxide. So if G is Cu(OH)2, heating gives CuO and water. But then, the precipitate would have to be a hydroxide. So perhaps the reaction of X with Y produces a metal hydroxide.

Putting it all together, perhaps X is a metal carbonate. Reacting with an acid (Y) would produce CO2 gas, water, and a metal salt. If the metal salt is insoluble, it would precipitate as a hydroxide if the solution is basic, but that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid, producing H2S gas, but H2S's molecule has 2 protons and 34 neutrons (since H has 0, S has 34? Wait, S has 16 protons, 16 neutrons in S-32. So each H2S molecule has 2 protons and 16 (from S) * 2? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's think about the melting point of B. If B is a solid that melts near 277 K (4°C), perhaps it's a metal. Metals usually melt at higher temperatures, but maybe it's not a metal. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids have the structure RCOCOOH. When they react with something, perhaps a base, they lose CO2. Wait, for example, a beta-keto acid (like acetoacetic acid) upon treatment with a base can undergo decarboxylation, losing CO2 and forming a ketone. So the product would have fewer oxygen atoms. But the product in this case has 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. If it's something like NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent. When a keto acid (like a ketone) reacts with a reducing agent, it might get reduced. But I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, another thought: the product of the reaction has two oxygen atoms. Suppose the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group. If X reacts with it, perhaps deprotonating it, but the product would still have two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a strong base, like NaOH. When a keto acid reacts with NaOH, the -COOH group would deprotonate to form a carboxylate ion. The product would be the sodium salt of the keto acid, which would have the same number of oxygen atoms as the acid. Let's see: a keto acid has, for example, RCO-COOH. The product would be RCO-COO^- Na^+.

Wait, but the problem states that the product of the reaction contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So perhaps the reaction is decarboxylation. For example, if the keto acid loses CO2, leaving a compound with fewer oxygen atoms. Suppose the starting keto acid has three oxygen atoms, and after losing CO2, it has one. But the problem says 2, so maybe the starting point has four oxygen atoms, and after losing two CO2, but no, that's not right.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydration. For example, converting a keto acid into an anhydride, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, and the reaction is something else. Let's think about the initial part again.

Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element with a heavy isotope. For example, chlorine has isotopes Cl-35 and Cl-37. So perhaps X contains chlorine.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of X with Y produces a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a hydroxide, and B is an oxide. For example, copper hydroxide when heated becomes copper oxide and water. If B is copper oxide, its melting point is around 2000°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride. Wait, but when heated, ammonium chloride decomposes into NH3 and HCl, but that doesn't form a solid B. Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate, which upon heating decomposes into CO2 and B. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let's think about the melting point again. 277 K is about 4°C. What solid melts around there? Maybe ice, but ice melts at 0°C. Perhaps something like a hydrated salt? For example, calcium chloride hexahydrate melts at about 0°C. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. The problem says especially its very close analog. Hmm. What reagents are commonly used? Maybe something like NaOH, KOH? Or maybe something like THF (tetrahydrofuran), but that's a solvent. Alternatively, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent, but those are typically organometallic and reactive.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of X with Y produces a precipitate G. If Y is an aqueous solution, perhaps X is a metal nitrate reacting with another solution to form a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: let's think about the possible options given. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29. These are the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Wait, the question says to calculate the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X has two elements, say, A and B. The lightest is A, the heaviest is B. So the sum would be atomic mass of A plus atomic mass of B.

Looking at the options: 35, 25, 31, 29. Let's think about possible elements whose sum of lightest and heaviest is one of these.

For example, if X is NaOH: Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24, not in the options.

If X is NH3: N (14), H (1). So lightest H (1), heaviest N (14). Sum 15, not an option.

If X is HCl: H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest H, heaviest Cl. Sum 36.5. Closest option is A)35. But the option is 35, so maybe H and Cl sum approx 36, which is not exactly an option. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope. So X could be something like Cl (with Cl-35 and Cl-37). So if X is HCl, the Cl could be the heavier isotope. But let me think.

Wait, another possibility: X is a diatomic molecule. Let's consider X as Cl2. But Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, but is it used as a reagent? Yes, Cl2 is a common reagent in organic chemistry, especially in substitution reactions. But the question says X incorporates a heavier isotope, so maybe it's Cl-37.

But wait, if X is Cl2, Y could be something like water, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, looking back, the product of a keto acid with X has 2 oxygen atoms. So perhaps X is a base, and the reaction is a neutralization. For example, if X is NaOH and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the product would be sodium acetate, which has O in acetate and O in NaOH. The sodium acetate would have more oxygen atoms. Hmm, but the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. For example, P2O5 is used as a dehydrating agent. When a keto acid reacts with P2O5, it
