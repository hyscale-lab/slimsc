Okay, so I'm trying to answer this astronomy question about how the number of stars changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax in arcseconds (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, which means distance d = 1/plx.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. I think that means the number density of stars is constant in space. So more stars would be at larger distances, but wait, how does that translate when we look at a range of parallaxes?

Let's think about the number of stars per unit volume. If the distribution is uniform, then the number of stars in a volume element dV is n * dV, where n is the number density (constant). But when we observe stars, we receive them based on their apparent brightness and their actual brightness. Wait, no, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx, assuming uniform distribution. So it's more about how many stars fall into a certain parallax interval.

Parallax is a measure of distance. So as parallax decreases (since plx = 1/d), distance increases. So the number of stars with higher parallax (closer) would be more dense because higher plx means closer distance, but wait, if they are uniformly distributed, the number depends on the volume.

Wait, maybe I should model it. Let's say I have a shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of this shell would be 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area times thickness. The surface area is 4π d².

Now, since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So let's change variables from d to plx. So dd = -d² d(plx), but perhaps I should express the volume in terms of plx.

Wait, d = 1/plx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx). Because when plx increases, d decreases, so as plx increases by d(plx), d changes by - (1/plx²) d(plx). Not sure if that's necessary right now.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx is proportional to the volume of the shell at distance d=1/plx with thickness dd. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd). But dd is (d plx)^-1 * dplx? Hmm, perhaps I should express dd in terms of dplx.

Wait, since d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx. But when plx increases, d decreases, so the shell volume is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = - (1/plx²) d plx, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) dplx. But we can take the absolute value since we're dealing with positive volumes. So 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the number of stars in a dplx interval would be the volume multiplied by the number density. Let me correct that. Let me denote n as the number density (stars per unit volume). So the number of stars in that shell is n * volume = n * 4π (d)^2 * dd.

But d=1/plx, so substituting:

n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

And since dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx, but I think the absolute value is better here because we're considering the thickness as positive. So:

n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx

Which simplifies to n * 4π / plx^4 * dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx interval (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's the number per unit plx. So the number per unit range of plx (dplx) is decreasing as 1/plx^4. So as plx increases (which means closer distances), the number of stars per unit plx interval decreases.

Wait, but the options are about how the number changes with plx. So if the number per unit plx interval is proportional to 1/plx^4, the number per unit plx range (dplx) scales with 1/plx^4. So the function is ~ 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~ 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume itself.

Consider a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is given by \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes:

\[
4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot dd.
\]

Next, express \( dd \) in terms of \( d\text{plx} \). Since \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we have:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting this into the volume expression:

\[
4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Taking the absolute value for simplicity, the volume becomes:

\[
4\pi \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume multiplied by the uniform number density \( n \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax \( d\text{plx} \) is:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
