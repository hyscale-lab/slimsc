Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the density matrix ρ given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space, with the options being A to D.

Wait, what's a density matrix again? Oh right, a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when the system is in a mixed state. Pure states can be represented as density matrices too, but then they're rank 1. This one looks like a mixture of |0> and |1>, so it's a mixed state.

So the density matrix ρ is a 2x2 matrix, right? Let me write it out. |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 at (2,2). So when you add them and multiply by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2, and the off-diagonal are zeros. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2].

I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, a single qubit state can be represented as a vector r on the unit sphere. For a pure state |ψ> = cos(θ/2)|0> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)|1>, the Bloch vector is (x, y, z) where x = sinθ cosφ, y = sinθ sinφ, z = cosθ. But wait, this is for pure states. Since ρ is a mixed state, how does that translate?

Oh right, for a density matrix ρ, the corresponding Bloch vector can be found using the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. Let me write that out. So, I is the identity matrix, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So ρ equals (I + σ_x r_x + σ_y r_y + σ_z r_z) all over 2.

Let me compute that. The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So (I + ... ) would add each term. So for our ρ, which is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]], let's set up the equation:

(1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) = (I + r·σ)/2.

Multiplying both sides by 2: |0><0| + |1><1| = I + r·σ.

But wait, |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix I. So I = I + r·σ.

Hmm, that would mean that r·σ must be zero matrix. Because I = I + 0. So the only way this is true is if each component of r is zero. Because the Pauli matrices are non-zero, so their linear combination (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) must be zero, which implies r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Which would be the completely mixed state, right? Because the Bloch vector is at the origin. That makes sense because this density matrix is a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with probability 1/2. So it's maximally mixed, like the completely depolarized state.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state where the qubit is in a statistical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general single-qubit density matrix, the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the given \(\rho\) into this formula, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right).
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

\[
\left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| = I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z.
\]

The left-hand side simplifies to the identity matrix \(I\), as \(|0\rangle\langle 0| + |1\rangle\langle 1| = I\). Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
I = I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z.
\]

Subtracting \(I\) from both sides gives:

\[
r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z = 0.
\]

Since the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are linearly independent, the only solution to this equation is \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector \(r\) is at the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
