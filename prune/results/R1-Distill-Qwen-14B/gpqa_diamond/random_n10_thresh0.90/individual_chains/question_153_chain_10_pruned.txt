Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, Michael additionâ€”right, that's when a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. I remember that the Michael reaction is a conjugate addition, which leads to the formation of an enolate intermediate. Okay, let's break down each part of the question.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each involves a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the major products for each, then match them with the options given.

Starting with part A: Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a di-ester of malonic acid. It can act as a donor in the Michael reaction. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be an acrylate ester with a p-tolyl group at the beta position. Since it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, it's the acceptor in the Michael reaction.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. Wait, but the acceptor here is an acrylate, which is more like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the substituent being p-tolyl. So, the acceptor is the conjugated ester.

Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups and a central CH2 group. So, when it acts as a nucleophile, it would attack the beta position of the acrylate. Wait, the acrylate has the structure CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, wait. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 (if we number from the ester), making the structure CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) connected to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the second carbon (the CH2=CH- group). So in 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is at the beta position, meaning the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3? Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure.

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-COOR. So for methyl acrylate, it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So when it's 3-substituted, like 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. So the structure is: the double bond is between C1 and C2, with the p-tolyl group on C2. So the ester is on C3.

So, the acceptor is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-
