Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem states that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(ν + X(y))ψ_f(y)

Hmm, wait, I think that might not be right. Oh wait, the actual Lagrangian is probably something like L = -λ F ψ̄ F ψ, where F is the fermion field. But the way it's written here is a bit confusing. Oh, wait, the original equation is:

L(y) = -λ f f̄ (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f (y)

Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh, perhaps it's actually:

L(y) = -λ ψ_f† (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f (y)

Where ν is some constant, perhaps the vacuum expectation value (VEV) since it's added to X(y), the field. This looks like a Yukawa interaction term, right? Because Yukawa couplings typically have a scalar field (like X) interacting with fermions, and the Lagrangian term is something like λ ψ† (φ + v) ψ, where φ is the scalar field and v is the VEV.

So the interaction term here would cause the scalar boson X to couple to fermions. That means X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decay channels of X at the lowest order.

Alright, so for a decay to be allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. Because in particle decays, the rest mass of the parent must be greater than or equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

So what's the mass of X? 6 GeV. Now, I need to think about the masses of the possible fermions that X can decay into.

Let me list the known fermion masses, focusing on quarks and leptons.

Quarks:
- Up (u) and Down (d): These are light, current masses around ~2-5 MeV. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact masses. Typically, their masses are much lower than the GeV scale. So 6 GeV is way heavier than twice 5 MeV. So u and d quarks would be allowed.

- Strange (s): Around ~100 MeV. So twice that is ~200 MeV, which is way less than 6 GeV. So s s̄ would be allowed.

- Charm (c): Mass around 1.5 GeV. Twice that is 3 GeV. So 6 GeV is more than 3 GeV, so yes, c c̄ decay is allowed.

- Bottom (b): Mass around 4-5 GeV, so twice that is around 8-10 GeV. Wait, X is 6 GeV, which is less than 8 GeV. So b and anti-b would require the sum of their masses to be 8 GeV, but X is only 6. So X can't decay into b b̄, because 6 < 8. So that's not allowed.

Top (t): Way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So twice that is 346 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, so no way.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): Mass ~0.5 MeV. Twice that is negligible, so allowed.

- Muon (μ): Mass ~105 MeV. Twice is ~210 MeV. 6 GeV is way more than that. So μ+ μ- allowed.

- Tau (τ): Mass ~1.78 GeV. Twice that is ~3.56 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.56 GeV. So τ+ τ- decay is allowed.

So possible fermion pairs for X decays include:

u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, e+ e-.

Wait, but earlier I thought that b b̄ is not allowed because 6 GeV < 8 GeV. So option A includes b b̄, which is not allowed. So this can't be the correct option.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

This includes c c̄, which is allowed (since 3 GeV <6 GeV). No b b̄, which is correct. Also, includes mu and tau leptons, which are allowed. So this option seems plausible.

Option C: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Wait, t is top quark, but that's way too heavy. X is 6 GeV, t is 173 GeV. 2*m_t is 346 GeV, which is way larger than X's mass. So t t̄ decay is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Same as option A, including b b̄ which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check: option B includes c c̄, which is correct because 6 GeV > 3 GeV (twice 1.5 GeV). So the allowed decays are:

c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Which matches option B.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem statement says the Lagrangian is L = -λ f f̄ (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, I think I might have misinterpreted the fields. Let's think again: ψ_f is the fermion field, perhaps. So the interaction term is similar to Yukawa coupling, which is L ~ g ψ† ψ X, so X can decay into two fermions. So the possible decays are any fermion-antifermion pair that satisfies the mass condition.

So, the possible decay products are any pair where each fermion has mass less than 3 GeV (since X is 6 GeV, each must be less than 3 GeV mass). Let me think about the fermion masses again:

Quarks:
- u: ~2 MeV
- d: ~3 MeV (but varies)
- s: ~95 MeV
- c: ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- b: ~4.5-5 GeV
- t: way too heavy.

So for X to decay into a pair, each fermion must be less than 3 GeV. So the fermions allowed are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau (since tau is ~1.78 GeV, so 2*1.78 ~3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, wait. Wait, 6 GeV (X's mass) must be >= 2*m_fermion. So for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, m_fermion must be <= 3 GeV.

So for each fermion:

e: 0.5 MeV → allowed.

mu: ~105 MeV → allowed.

tau: ~1.78 GeV → allowed, since 2*1.78=3.56 GeV <6 GeV.

c: 1.5 GeV → allowed.

s: 95 MeV → allowed.

d: ~3 MeV → allowed.

u: ~2 MeV → allowed.

b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 *2=9 GeV >6 GeV → not allowed.

So the allowed fermions are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So the decay channels are:

uū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Which matches option B exactly. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ-, μ+ μ-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's right. So the correct option is B.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the quark masses. Are the masses I'm recalling correct?

For example, the current masses of the up and down quarks are around 2-5 MeV, but their constituent masses are higher. But in terms of actual rest mass, it's the current mass that matters for decay. So yes, u and d are allowed.

So the allowed decays are option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction term provided in the Lagrangian. The interaction term resembles a Yukawa coupling, allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it decays into.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass of \( X \):** \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
2. **Fermion Mass Constraints:** For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be allowed, the mass of the fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \). Thus, \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

3. **Fermion Masses:**
   - **Quarks:**
     - \( u, d \): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5-5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
     - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - **Leptons:**
     - \( e \): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105 \, \text{MeV} \) (allowed).
     - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

4. **Allowed Decays:** Based on the above, the allowed decay channels are:
   - \( X \to u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B:** Matches the allowed decays \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). Correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
