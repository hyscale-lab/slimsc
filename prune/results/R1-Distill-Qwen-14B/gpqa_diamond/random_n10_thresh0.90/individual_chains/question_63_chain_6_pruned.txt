Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember the fundamental state usually refers to the lowest energy state, but wait, sometimes it's the first excited state? No, no, wait. Fundamental state is the ground state. So for a diatomic molecule modeled by the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions.

The molecule can absorb a photon, and we need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between these two states.

Wait, but wait. The problem specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. So what's the next state after the ground state? Well, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. The vibrational energy levels are quantized, and the rotational are as well. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model? Not sure about that part. Oh wait, for the rigid rotor, the ground state is J=0. But for the non-rigid rotor, maybe it's a bit different.)

Wait, but the problem is about a non-rigid rotor model. I think in the rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational motions are considered independently, with the bond length fixed. But the non-rigid rotor model accounts for bond vibrations, so maybe the rotational energy levels are influenced by the vibrational state. Or perhaps the problem treats it as a rotation-vibration coupling model, where the energy levels are a combination of both.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the transition when the molecule absorbs a photon. So, the photon's energy must match the energy difference between two adjacent states. Since it's going to the next state, that should be the smallest possible energy increase, which would be a transition to the next higher state in one of the possible quantum numbers.

But what's the next state? The fundamental state is the lowest energy, so the next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (like J=1) depending on which requires less energy.

Wait, but in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational energies. So the overall energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So when the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0. What's the next state? It could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0 and J=1. But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy needs to match the difference.

Hmm, let's think about the energy of the vibrational and rotational transitions. Vibrational transitions are usually higher energy than rotational ones because the vibrational energy levels are spaced more widely. For example, the vibrational energy quantum is (1/2)hω + hω for the first transition. The rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I) where I is the moment of inertia. So I need to calculate both the vibrational and rotational energy differences and see which is smaller.

Wait, but the question says it's a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the molecule can undergo transitions that involve both vibrational and rotational changes, but the minimal energy transition would be the one that requires the least photon energy. So, which transition is lower in energy: the first vibrational transition (v=0→v=1) or the first rotational transition (J=0→J=1)?

Let me compute both energies.

First, let's find the vibrational energy difference. The energy levels of vibration are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h ω. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 would require a photon of energy ΔE_vibrational = h ω.

Next, the rotational energy levels. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = [J (J+1) ] ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length is not fixed. So I guess the moment of inertia might change with the vibrational state. But perhaps for this problem, they treat I as constant, using the bond length R. So I'll proceed with that.

So, the rotational energy difference when going from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rotational = E_J=1 - E_J=0 = [ (2)(1) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I) ) = (2) ħ²/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Wait, so ΔE_rot = ħ²/(I) and ΔE_vibr = h ω.

So which is smaller: h ω or ħ²/(I)?

We can compute both.

Given the data:

Mass of X (Mx) = 20 amu

Mass of Y (My) = 2 amu

Bond length R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

Angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s.

So first, compute the reduced mass μ.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) 

Mx = 20, My=2. So Mx + My =22.

μ = (20 * 2) / 22 = 40 / 22 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.66e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ let's compute that. 1.818 * 1.66 ≈ 3.017. So μ ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, 1.818 * 1.66: 1.8 *1.66 = approx 2.988, 0.018 *1.66≈0.03. So total around 3.018. So μ ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

The moment of inertia I = μ R².

R is 2e-10 m. So R² = (2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I = μ R² = 3.018e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = approx 1.207e-46 kg m².

Wait, let me compute that.

3.018e-27 *4e-20 = (3.018 *4) * 1e-47 = 12.072e-47 = 1.2072e-46 kg m².

So I ≈ 1.207e-46 kg m².

Now, compute ħ²/I.

ħ is the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ approx (1.112e-68) (J² s²).

Wait, but the exact value isn't critical right now; let's compute ħ²/(I):

ħ²/I ≈ (1.0545718e-34)^2 / 1.207e-46.

Let me compute that:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 1.112e-68.

So 1.112e-68 divided by 1.207e-46 is approximately (1.112 / 1.207) * 1e-22 ≈ approx 0.921 * 1e-22 = 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Wait, 1e-68 divided by 1e-46 is 1e-22. So yes.

Wait, 1e-68 / 1e-46 = 1e-22. So 1.11e-68 / 1.2e-46 ≈ (1.11/1.2) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.925e-22 = 9.25e-23 J.

So the rotational energy ΔE_rot is about 9.25e-23 J.

Now, what's the vibrational energy difference? ΔE_vibr = h ω.

h is Planck's constant, approx 6.626e-34 J s.

ω is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So ΔE_vibr = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Compare the two: 2.65e-19 J (vibrational) vs 9.25e-23 J (rotational). So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon with lower energy is the rotational one. So the molecule would need to absorb a photon with energy matching ΔE_rot, which is about 9.25e-23 J.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the state with the lowest possible energy transition. So the photon's energy should be the smaller of the two.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake. Because in a diatomic molecule, the transitions are not purely rotational or vibrational but a combination of both. But for the selection rules, the change in J is ±1 and Δv = ±1, but not sure about that. Wait, in the pure rotational spectra, Δv=0, but in vibrational spectra, Δv=±1. But in the rotation-vibration model, perhaps transitions can involve changes in both J and v.

Wait, but I'm not sure. The problem is about the next state with the lowest energy. So perhaps the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, and we need the one with the least energy.

But from the calculations, the rotational transition requires much less energy, so the photon's energy would be 9.25e-23 J.

But wait, let me think again. The question says: the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the ground state (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one that's the next in the energy levels. So it could be either a higher J (J=1) with same v=0, or v=1 and same J=0.

But which of these two has a lower energy?

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest in energy. Next possible states would be J=1 (same v=0) or v=1 (same J=0). Which one has lower energy?

Wait, we can compute both and see.

Compute E_rot for J=1: E_J=1 = [2 * ħ² ]/(2I) = ħ²/(I) ≈9.25e-23 J.

Compute E_vibr for v=1: E_v=1 = h ω = 2.65e-19 J.

So clearly, the rotational transition is lower in energy. Therefore, the photon's energy should be 9.25e-23 J.

But wait, the problem says to find the momentum of the photon. Because the energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. Wait, no, more accurately, E = pc (since for photons, E = hf = hc/λ, and p = E/c).

So, if E_photon = ΔE, then p = E / c.

So, E_photon = 9.25e-23 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.25e
