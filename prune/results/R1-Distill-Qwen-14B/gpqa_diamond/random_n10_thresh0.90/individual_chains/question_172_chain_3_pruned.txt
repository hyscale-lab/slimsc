Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, wait, noâ€”wait, actually, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the excitation level for star_1 is higher. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2. The options are A, B, C, D. 

I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the Boltzmann equation comes into play. The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. 

The Boltzmann factor is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels. The formula is n_j / n_i = exp( - (E_j - E_i) / (k*T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and E_j and E_i are the energies of levels j and i respectively.

In this scenario, I think the two energy levels are the excited and ground states. Let's say that in star_1, the excitation is higher, which would mean more atoms are in the higher energy level compared to star_2. But wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. Wait, does that mean that the population in the higher energy level is twice as much? Or does it mean the excitation energy is twice as much? No, I think it refers to the number of atoms in that specific energy level being twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

So, let's say the two energy levels are E2 (excited) and E1 (ground). The number ratio for each star would be:

For star_1: n2_1 / n1_1 = (something)
For star_2: n2_2 / n1_2 = (something else)

But wait, wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. Let me denote the energy levels as E_high and E_low. The ratio of their populations is given by the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio n_high / n_low = exp( - (E_high - E_low) / (k T) )

But the problem states that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote this as delta_E = E_high - E_low = 1.38e-23 J.

But wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as much for star_1. So for star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2's excited state. Or wait, no, maybe it's that the excitation (the number in the higher level) in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same level. Hmm.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms
