Alright, I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's all about. Okay, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. The options are all different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

Let me start by looking at each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the problem says "very broad," which might make me think of a strong hydrogen bonding, perhaps in an alcohol or maybe an acid. But I should also look at the other peaks. There's a strong peak at 1700 and another at 1650. Hmm, the 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups (C=O). Now, the 1650 might be another carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but that might be less likely here.

Wait, but if the compound has both a carbonyl and another peak around 1650, maybe it's something like a ketone and an ester, or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, could it be a carbonyl and an aromatic ring? Because aromatic rings (like in benzene) have absorption around 1600, but maybe if it's a substituted ring or conjugated, that's where the 1650 comes in.

Next, the ¹H NMR spectrum. They mention peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl Hs are the ones on a double bond, like CH₂=CH. So the compound has a double bond, probably either an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring (which is a conjugated diene). But if it's an aromatic ring, the protons might appear downfield, but vinyl protons are usually in the 5-6 ppm range. So the presence of vinyl Hs suggests there's a double bond, not necessarily aromatic.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Let me recall, common fragments: maybe a methyl group attached to something? Or perhaps a ketone fragment. Wait, 45 could be CH3-O-CO- or something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be a carbonyl group with some substituents. Let me think about the options.

Now, looking at the possible formulas:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So all are C6, varying H and O.

Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For each option:

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=2/2=1. So DoU is 1. That could be one ring or one double bond, or a combination.

Option B: C=6, H=10, O=1.

DoU=(14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a triple bond and a ring. Hmm, but the NMR suggests a double bond, so perhaps a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C=6, H=10, O=2.

DoU=(14-10)/2=4/2=2. So same as B, two DoU.

Option D: C=6, H=12, O=1.

DoU=(14-12)/2=2/2=1. So same as A, one DoU.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are vinyl hydrogens. So the compound has at least one double bond, so the DoU must be at least 1. All options have at least that. The IR shows a broad peak at 3000, which suggests O-H (maybe alcohol or carboxylic acid). But carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and stronger. But the options don't include a compound with two O's and a carboxylic acid group, but let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Esters have carbonyl groups, and an O-H might not be present. Wait, no, esters don't have O-H; they have an ether linkage. Unless it's an alcohol and another functional group.

Wait, the IR shows a broad peak around 3000, which is probably O-H. So the compound has an O-H group. So the options must have at least one O in the formula. All options have O except possibly none, but here all include O in the formula.

Looking back, the IR peaks: 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching (around 1600 usually), but 1650 is a bit higher. So maybe it's an ester or a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, if there are two carbonyl groups, that would mean DoU increases. Let's check the options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU is 2. So two double bonds or a ring and a double bond.

Option A: DoU is 1. So if there's a carbonyl group, that would account for the DoU, but then another feature would need to come from elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So the DoU should include that.

So if the structure has an O-H (from the broad IR peak), a carbonyl (IR at 1700), a double bond (from NMR), and perhaps another carbonyl or ring.

Let me think of possible structures. Maybe an ester with a double bond and an O-H group. Wait, but esters don't have O-H. So perhaps the O-H is a hydroxyl group, like in a diol, but then another carbonyl.

Alternatively, it could be a ketone with an alcohol group. But if it's a ketone, the carbonyl is around 1700. Then, the O-H (broad) would be from an alcohol. So the structure could be something like a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group.

Wait, another possibility: if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So, an ester (with carbonyl at 1700) and a conjugated double bond (which would have a peak around 1650. That would fit the IR data. But then, where does the O-H come in? Oh wait, if the compound has an ester and an alcohol group, but that would require two O's. For example, perhaps a structure like CH₂=CHCOOCH₂CH₂OH? But that's just a thought; maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, think about the possible functional groups. If the compound has an ester and a hydroxyl group, like a glycolic ester or something similar.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ester of a diacid, but that might not fit the H count.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a lactone. Lactones have an ester ring and a hydroxyl group. No, wait, lactones are cyclic esters, so they don't have a free O-H. Hmm.

Let me think about the molecular formulas.

Option A: C6H12O2. The formula would have a molecular weight of (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 72 +10 +32=114.

Which fragment would have m/z 45. Let me think about common fragments. 45 is a common m/z for (CH3CO)+, which is the acetate ion. Because CH3CO is 45 (12+1*3 +12 +16=45). So if the compound has an acetate group, that might fragment to give 45. So maybe the compound is an ester, like an acetate.

But wait, to have an acetate group, the formula would have to include an acetyl group. Let me see.

If the formula is C6H10O2, that's similar to an ester like methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's see the possible functional groups. The IR has a broad O-H (probably alcohol) and a strong carbonyl (1700). So maybe it's a ketone and an alcohol. But that would be a ketone (O=C-) and an -OH group.

Wait, but then DoU: for option D, C6H12O: DoU is 1. So if there's a ketone (O=C-) and an alcohol (OH), that would account for the O's, but the DoU would be 1 from the ketone. But then, if the compound also has a double bond, which is suggested by the NMR, then the DoU would be 2, which doesn't match option D. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an ester (so O in the ester group) and an alcohol. Wait, but that would require O in both groups. So the formula would have more oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group. So, for example, an ester like CH₂=CHCOOR. Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula for that.

If the ester is, say, methyl propenoate: CH₂=CHCOOCH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. But the options are C6, so perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like cyclopentene oxide, but that's an epoxide, which wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a beta-keto ester. That way, it has two carbonyl groups. For example, ethyl acetoacetate. Let me think about its formula. Acetoacetate is (CH3CO)CH2COO-R. Wait, for ethyl acetoacetate, the formula is C5H8O3, which is not matching any of the given options. So that's probably not it.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond. But earlier I thought lactones don't have OH groups. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester with a double bond.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So it's a double bond, maybe isolated or in a ring. Let's think about the possible structures.

Looking back at the IR: the 1700 is a strong peak, which could be an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), which would have a lower wavenumber than a regular ester. So maybe the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but if it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the structure would have a double bond next to the carbonyl. That would fit the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak as the conjugated double bond. The 1700 would be the ester carbonyl.

So the structure would be something like CH₂=CHCOOR, where R is some group. But then, where is the O-H group?

Hmm, maybe the structure has both an ester group and a hydroxyl
