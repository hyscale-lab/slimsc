Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period means it's orbiting more quickly, which usually means a smaller orbit.

The host stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but similar in radius. But Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Hmm, does the star's mass affect the planet's orbital distance? Well, Kepler's third law says that the orbital period squared is proportional to (a^3)/(M_total), where M_total is the mass of the star plus planet. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star, we can approximate M_total as just the star's mass. So a^3 is proportional to (P^2 * M_star). 

Wait, so for Planet_1, P is shorter by a factor of 3, and M is twice as much. Let me think:

For Kepler's law, the semi-major axis a is proportional to ( (P^2 * M) )^(1/3). So Planet_1's a is ( ( (P1^2) * M1 ) )^(1/3). Similarly for Planet_2: a2 is ( (P2^2 * M2) )^(1/3).

Given that P1 is (1/3) P2, and M1 is 2 M2.

So a1 = [ ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * 2 M2 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ ( P2² * 2 M2 ) / 9 ) ]^(1/3 )

= [ (2/9) * (P2² M2) ) ]^(1/3 )

a2 is [ ( P2^2 M2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

What's 2/9? That's about 0.222, so cube root is roughly 0.6 something. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of transit. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I recall is that the probability is approximately (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, actually, the transit probability is given by (R_star / a) * (some factor, but I think it's (R_star / a) squared? Or maybe that's the area blocked. Wait, no. The geometric probability for a transit is R_star / (a (1 - e²)^0.5 ), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so it's R_star / (a).

So the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) / (something). Wait, no, let me think again.

The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star to the orbital distance, divided by the semi-major axis. So the probability P is roughly (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if a is larger, R_* / a is smaller, which would mean lower probability. So higher a implies lower probability of transit.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a), but in reality, it's (R_star / a) * (something else?) Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think differently. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, because the area of the sky where the planet can transit is a circle with diameter R_*, and the total possible area is the area of the orbit (a circle with radius a). So the probability is (R_* / a )^2 * (something else?), but wait, no, the area ratio is (R_*²) / (a²), but that's not exactly the case because the planet's orbit is much larger than the star.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_* / a. Wait, that's a linear relation. So higher a → lower probability.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me check. The transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance, as a fraction. So probability ≈ (R_*/a) * (some factor based on inclination). Since the orbits are circular, and the only factor is the alignment, the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) / (something). Wait, actually, the probability is (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (a/R_* )) ), but that's probably not right. Alternatively, the probability is simply (R_*/a) * (1/(something)), but perhaps I should look for a formula.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital distance. So, geometrically, the chance that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight is (R_*/a) * (1 / (some factor)), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_* + R_p) / a. Since R_p is much smaller than R_*, this is approximately R_* / a.

But wait, no, I think the actual probability is given by (R_*/a) * (something involving the star's size relative to the orbit). Alternatively, the probability is (R_* / a) * (1 / (something else)), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of angular size. The star has an angular radius θ = R_* / a. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately θ², because the area where the planet can block the star is a circle of radius θ on the sky. The total possible area for alignment is a circle of radius π (but wait, no, because the orbital distance is a, and the planet has to pass within the star's disk, which is much smaller, so I think the probability is actually (R_* / a)² divided by something else, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is approximately (R_*/a) / (1 + (R_*/a)), but that might not be correct. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_*/a) * (1/(something)), but this isn't helping.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the transit probability is given by (R_*/a) * (1 / (something), like the impact parameter). Wait, no, the impact parameter affects whether a transit occurs but the overall probability is more about the orbital alignment.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look for the formula. I think the transit probability P is given by:

P ≈ (R_* + R_p) / a

But since R_p << R_*, it's approximately R_*/a. So the probability is proportional to R_*/a.

Wait, that can't be right because if a is larger, the probability should be smaller. So P is proportional to 1/a, but also proportional to R_*.

So in our case, the probability is (R_*/a) * (some constant), but for the purpose of comparing two planets, the constants would cancel out.

So P1 ∝ R1*/a1

P2 ∝ R2*/a2

But in the problem, both host stars have the same radii, R_*. So R1* = R2* = R.

So P1 ∝ (R) / a1

P2 ∝ (R) / a2

So the ratio P2/P
