Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. They've given me the production energy, mass, and width. Wait, what's the formula for mean decay distance again?

I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (which relates to the width Γ) and the uncertainty in time (which is the lifetime τ) are inversely proportional. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Wait, but units might be tricky here.

Also, the decay distance would be the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime, right? So distance = v * τ. But wait, the particle's lifetime is from its own frame. Since it's moving relativistically, I might need to consider time dilation. Oh wait, that's right. The lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer by the Lorentz factor γ.

So, putting it together, the steps should be:

1. Calculate the Lorentz factor γ using the energy and mass.
2. Find the mean lifetime τ from the width Γ using τ ≈ ħ/(Γ).
3. Multiply τ by γ to get the proper lifetime in the lab frame.
4. Multiply by the velocity v to get the decay distance.

Wait, but velocity v can be expressed in terms of βγ since v = βc, where β = v/c. And from the energy, I can find β.

Let me think about how to compute γ. The energy E is related to the rest mass m by E = γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But wait, the units here are given in GeV and MeV, so I'll have to make sure to handle the units correctly.

Let me write down the given values:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV

Wait, units: 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. Okay.

So first, compute γ:

γ = E / (m c²) → but wait, units: E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c². So when I compute E/(m c²), the units would be (GeV)/(GeV/c² * c²) ) → GeV / GeV → dimensionless, which is correct for γ.

So plugging in the numbers:

γ = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) → 8/1.2 = 6.666... So γ ≈ 6.6667.

Next, find the mean lifetime τ. The formula is τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But Γ is in GeV, and ħ is in units like GeV·s (since ħ ≈ 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s).

Wait, let's recall the value of ħ in GeV·s. Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, 1 GeV = 1e9 eV. So, ħc is about 197.33 MeV·fm, but maybe that's another relation. Alternatively, I know that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ.

Plugging in the numbers:

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s
Γ = 0.32 GeV

So τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 → let me calculate that.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 → 20.56875e-25 → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let me compute that accurately
