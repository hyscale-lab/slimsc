Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about a star whose surface temperature changes when spots cover part of its surface. When 40% of the surface is covered, the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay, so first, the key concepts here are the Boltzmann equation and how it relates to the excitation of atoms in the stellar photosphere. Since the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann distribution to model the population of these energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights of the levels, E_i and E_j their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the question, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when the temperature is higher (6000 K). Because lower temperature means less thermal energy, so lower excitation, so fewer atoms in higher energy levels.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 and level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots. Or is it the other way around? Let me clarify.

The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the ratio without spots is higher. So the factor would be (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = some number greater than 1.

But wait, the question is about the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So if without spots it's R1, and with spots it's R2, the factor is R1/R2.

So, the key is to model R1 and R2 using the Boltzmann equation.

But wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at one temperature when spots are present. Oh wait, but the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. I think that the problem is approximating the entire photosphere as being at a single temperature, 5500 K, when 40% spots are present. So maybe I can model each scenario (with and without spots) using a single temperature.

So, the ratio R = (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because the energy difference is E2 - E1 in the exponent. Wait, wait. Let me get that right. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE = E_upper - E_lower. So for level 2 being higher than level 1, E2 > E1. So the exponent is negative when E2 > E1.

Wait, let me write it correctly. The ratio of n1 to n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Since E2 > E1, E1 - E2 is negative, so the exponent becomes positive. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The general formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So, if E_i > E_j, then (E_i - E_j) is positive, so the exponential is exp(-positive/(k T)). As temperature T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, making the ratio larger.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the temperature T_eff drops. So let's compute R without spots (T=6000 K) and R with spots (T=5500 K).

But wait, the problem doesn't give us the energies of the levels. Oh, but it does give the wavelength of the transition: approximately 1448 Å. So that's the wavelength λ corresponding to the transition between the two levels. I can find the energy difference using the relation E = hc / λ.

So first, calculate the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

Let me compute that. Constants: h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m).

So, ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Calculating that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Now, to get this in terms of eV (electron volts), since typically in atomic physics, energies are expressed in eV. 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J.

So, ΔE (eV) = 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ (1.373 / 1.602) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) )

Wait, 1e-18 / 1e-19 is 10, so:

ΔE ≈ (1.373 / 1.602) * 10 ≈ approximately 8.57 eV.

Wait, that's a rough estimate. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = (1.373 / 1.602) * (1e-18 / 1e-19) )

Which is (0.857) * 10 = 8.57 eV. So about 8.57 eV.

So ΔE is about 8.57 eV.

Alternatively, another approach: 1448 Å is in the near UV or visible range. Hmm, but perhaps I can compute the value more accurately.

Wait, let me compute hc/lambda in eV·Å to make it easier.

Since hc ≈ 12400 eV·Å (I remember this value because 1240 nm is about 1 eV, so 12400 eV·Å is hc).

So, hc = 12400 eV·Å.

λ = 1448 Å.

So, ΔE = hc/λ = 12400 / 1448 ≈ let's calculate that.

1448 * 8 = 11584. 12400 - 11584 = 816. So 8 + (816 / 1448) ≈ 8.564 eV.

Yes, so approximately 8.564 eV. So about 8.56 eV.

Now, the energy difference is 8.56 eV. But wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the energy of a photon emitted when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one is given by E_photon = hc/λ. So the energy difference between the two levels is exactly this. So yes, E2 - E1 = 8.56 eV.

Now, in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T), but with a negative sign because it's (E_i - E_j)/(k T), but in our case, i is level 2 and j is level 1? Or perhaps I should clarify the indices.

Wait, in the general ratio n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So in our case, level 1 and level 2. Let's say level 2 is higher than level 1. So E2 > E1. So when you go from level 2 to 1, you emit a photon of energy ΔE = E2 - E1 = 8.56 eV.

So to find n1/n2, which is the ratio of the lower level to the upper level, we have:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Because E_i would be E2 and E_j would be E1. So E_i - E_j = ΔE.

So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, wait no. Wait, n1 is the number of atoms in level 1, and n2 in level 2. So when you compute n1/n2, it's (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-derive it.

The Boltzmann equation is:

n_i = n_j * (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So, for i = 1 and j = 2, we have:

n1 = n2 * (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

But E1 - E2 is negative because E2 > E1. So -(E1 - E2) is positive, so the exponent is positive.

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Yeah, that makes sense. So the higher the temperature, the more the ratio n1/n2 increases, because the exponent is positive, and as T increases, the exponent (ΔE/(k T)) becomes smaller, so the exp term becomes larger.

So, when the star has spots and T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 will be lower than when it doesn't have spots.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So without spots, T = 6000 K; with spots, T =5500 K.

So, the ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k * 6000) )

And R2 (with spots) is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k * 5500) )

So the factor is R1/R2 = [exp(ΔE/(k * 6000))] / [exp(ΔE/(k * 5500))] )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, because R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

So let me compute the exponent.

First, compute (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(
