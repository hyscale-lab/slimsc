Okay, so I've got this question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula for an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let's break down the information given and see what each clue tells me.

First, the question lists the techniques used: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are different chemical formulas, so I'll need to match the data to one of them.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The main absorption peaks are at 3000 (very broad), 1700, and 1650 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak around 3000 usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, maybe it's an -OH group from an ester or something else? Alternatively, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid since those have broad O-H stretches. But sometimes alcohols can have broad peaks too.

The strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit tricky. I think that might be a conjugated carbonyl group, perhaps a carbonyl next to an electron-withdrawing group. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic carbonyl. Wait, no, 1650 is more in the range for conjugated double bonds or possibly an amide. But I'm not sure about that. Another possibility is an ester's carbonyl being at around 1700, and maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching, but that's usually around 1600. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe part of a ring or a substituent. So the structure might have an alkene group.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment for an ethylene group (maybe CH₂CH₂+?), but wait, more accurately, 45 could correspond to a fragment like (CH₂)₂O or something else. Alternatively, 45 is the mass for a CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) ion, but I'm not certain. Wait, what about the molecular ion? Let me think about the possible molecular formulas and their molecular weights.

The options are:
A) C6H12O2 → Molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) → 72 +12 +32 = 116 g/mol.
B) C6H10O → (72)+(10)+(16)=98 g/mol.
C) C6H10O2 → (72)+(10)+(32)=114 g/mol.
D) C6H12O → (72)+(12)+(16)=100 g/mol.

Wait, but the mass spec shows a fragment at 45. So I need to think about what would break off to give m/z 45. For example, when a molecule breaks, possible fragments include smaller alkanes, alkenes, or functional groups. Let's think about each formula.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structure could be a cyclic ester (like a lactone), a diester, or maybe an aromatic compound with substituents. But with two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's something like an ester or a ketone with another group.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a molecular formula that might correspond to a cyclic ether with a double bond or an aromatic ring with substituents. For example, maybe something like cyclohexene oxide.

Option C: C6H10O2. This has two oxygen atoms. Maybe a cyclic ester or a compound with both ester and ether groups. Alternatively, maybe a diester or something like that.

Option D: C6H12O. That's similar to option B but with more hydrogens. Maybe a diol or something else.

Back to the IR data. The 1700 cm⁻¹ could be an ester or ketone. But the broad peak around 3000 probably indicates an -OH group. So if the compound has an -OH, then the formula probably includes an O. So the options are A, C, D. Wait, option B only has one O and that's it. So if the broad peak is due to an -OH, then options A, C, D are possible.

Wait, but the IR also shows a peak at 1650. Let me think: if the compound has an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1700, and maybe another group. Alternatively, if it's a conjugated carbonyl, maybe a ketone next to a double bond, which would lower the carbonyl frequency, making it around 1680-1650. So maybe that's where the 1650 comes in.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the structure has a double bond. So the molecule isn't a completely saturated compound. Looking at the options, their degrees of unsaturation can help.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, it's (2C + 2 - H - O)/2? Wait, wait, correct formula is Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, Degrees = (2*C + 2 - H - O)/2.

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2.

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 → (14-14)/2=0. So zero degrees of unsaturation. That's not possible because the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond (1 degree). So option A is probably not correct.

Option B: C=6, H=10, O=1.

Degrees = (12+2 -10 -1)/2 → (14-11)/2=3/2=1.5. Hmm, fractional degrees? That can't be. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's recalculate.

Wait, the correct formula for Degrees of Unsaturation is:

Degrees = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2.

So for option B: C=6, H=10, O=1.

So 2*6=12, +2=14; H=10, X=0, N=0. So 14 -10 -0 +0=4. Divided by 2 → 2 degrees.

Wait, that's better. So 2 degrees. That can be one double bond and one ring, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C=6, H=10, O=2.

Degrees: (2*6 +2 -10 -2)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That would be either a ring or a double bond.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So option C must have at least one double bond. But according to degrees of unsaturation, it's only one. So either a double bond or a ring. If it's a ring plus a double bond, that would be two, but wait, the calculation says one. So maybe it's a ring and a double bond? Wait, no, each ring is one degree. Each double bond is one. So if a molecule has one ring and one double bond, that would be two degrees.

Wait, but option C's degrees are 1. So perhaps a single double bond or a single ring.

But the presence of a vinyl group (double bond) would require at least one degree. So option C's structure could have a double bond, making it 1 degree. Alternatively, a ring plus a double bond would require two, which it doesn't have. So perhaps option C is a compound with one double bond and no rings.

Option D: C=6, H=12, O=1.

Degrees: (12 +2 -12 -1)/2 = (14 -13)/2=0.5. Hmm, again fractional. Wait, maybe I should check the calculation again.

Wait, 2C +2 = 12 + 2 =14. H=12, O=1.

14 -12 (H) -1 (O) → 14-13=1. Divided by 2→ 0.5. That can't be right. So perhaps D isn't possible. Wait, maybe I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong. Wait, the correct formula for Degrees of Unsaturation is: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for D: C=6, H=12, O=1.

So 2*6=12 +2=14. H=12, O=1 (but O doesn't affect the formula). So 14 -12=2. Divided by 2 → 1 degree. So 1 degree. So it could be one double bond or one ring.

But looking back, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So D would have one double bond. So the structure would have a double bond but no ring.

Now, considering all this, let's go back to the IR. The 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. If the compound has an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1700. The 1650 could be an adjacent double bond, perhaps in conjugation. So for example, an ester with a conjugated double bond. But that would require the structure to have a conjugated enol ester or something like that.

Looking at the options, the possible structures could be something like methyl vinyl ether, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with a double bond.

Wait, the Mass Spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about that. 45 is the mass of (CH3)2O (if I'm not mistaken, that's 45: 12 + 3*1 (CH3) *2 + 16). Wait, (CH3)2O is (2*(15)) + 16 → wait, 15*2=30 +16=46. No, wait, molecular formula of (CH3)2O is C2H6O, which has a molecular weight of (2*12) + (6*1) +16=24+6+16=46. So that can't be the 45 peak.

Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of CH2=CH-O- something. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from an ethylene group (CH2=CH2), but that's 28. Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me calculate the possible molecular formulas and see what their possible fragments would be.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116. If the fragment is 45, that leaves 71 as the remaining. 71 is a possible mass for a benzene ring (C6H5 would be 77, but maybe with some loss). Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group or something else.

Option B: C6H10O. MW 98. If 45 is a fragment, the remaining is 53. Hmm, not sure what that would be.

Option C: C6H10O2. MW 114. Subtract 45 gives 69. 69 could be C3H7O or something else. Not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. MW 100. 45 would leave 55. 55 is often a m/z for a CO+ ion (28 for CO, but 55? Not exactly. Wait, maybe a CH2CH2O group? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone or an ester group. For example, a fragment like O=C-O-R could lose a part to give a 45 m/z. Wait, 45 could be a (CH3)CO+ ion, which is 58. No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is an ester group losing some part.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a (CH2)2O group. Wait, (CH2)2O is 45: C2H4O → 24 +4 +16=44. Hmm, close but not 45. Wait, perhaps it's another structure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion is the highest peak in the mass spectrum, but the question says there's a fragment at m/z=45. So perhaps the molecular ion is higher, but a fragment breaks off into a 45 mass.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is 114. If it breaks into 45 and 69, 69 is a possible fragment, but not sure.

Alternatively, if the molecular formula is C6H12O2, molecular weight 116. Breaking into 45 and 71. 71 is the molecular weight of C4H9O (like CH2CH2CH2CH2O, but not sure).

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible functional groups. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, so maybe an enol ether or some conjugated system.

Alternatively, the IR might suggest an ester and a conjugated group. So maybe the structure is something like an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, let's consider each option and the possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Could be an ester and a cyclic structure, but earlier the degrees of unsaturation suggested zero, which contradicts the presence of a double bond. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

Wait, option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation calculation.

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 → (14-14)/2=0. So zero degrees. That would imply a fully saturated compound, no rings or double bonds. But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are in a double bond. So this contradicts. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees = (12+2 -10 -1)/2 → (14-11)/2=1.5. Wait, that can't be. So I think I messed up earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, molecular formula for option B: C6H10O.

Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*6 + 2 -10 -1)/2 → (14 -11)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5. Hmm, fractional degrees don't make sense. So that's impossible, meaning option B is not possible. So we can eliminate option B.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees = (12+2 -10 -2)/2 → (14-12)/2=1. So one degree. Which can be a double bond or a ring.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees = (12+2 -12 -1)/2 → (14-13)/2=0.5. Also fractional, so D is not possible. So after this, the only possible options are C and maybe A, but A has zero degrees, which doesn't fit.

So now only option C is left. So the formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, but let me think again. The IR shows 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. So if it's an ester, which has a carbonyl around 1700, and the 1650 could be something else, maybe a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring. But if the molecule has a conjugated system, the carbonyl might shift.

Also, in the NMR, vinyl hydrogens would show up in the range of, say, 4.5-6.5 ppm. So that supports the presence of a double bond.

The mass spec fragment 45. Let me think about what could give that. If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, maybe the structure is something like methyl vinyl carbonate or another ester with a vinyl group.

Wait, for example, a structure like CH2=CHCO2R. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester with a double bond.

But let's think about the possible fragments. For a molecule with formula C6H10O2, molecular weight 114.

If it's a cyclic ester (lactone), perhaps a five or six-membered ring. Let's say it's a five-membered ring: gamma-butyrolactone would be C4H6O2, which is not what we have. So perhaps a larger ring.

Alternatively, if the compound is an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 or something. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion for option C (C6H10O2, 114) could break into a 45 fragment. So 45 is 45. Let's see what possible structures have a mass of 45.

Possible fragments with m/z 45:

- C3H7O: 3*12 +7 +16=36 +7 +16=59. No.

Wait, 45 could be CH2CH2OCH3 (no, that's more than 45), or perhaps a fragment like (CH2)2O, which is 45? Let me calculate: (CH2)2O is C2H4O → 24 +4 +16=44. Close but not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a COCH2CH2 group? No, that would be higher.

Alternatively, maybe a (CH3)CO+ ion. That would be 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43). Not 45.

Wait, another possibility is a CH2CH2O fragment. Wait, that's 44. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O group attached to something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketene group, but I don't know.

Wait, looking for possible molecular formulas that sum up to 45. Let's see:

45 can be:

- C3H3O → 36 +3 +16=55. No.
- C3H7O → 36 +7 +16=59.
- C2H5O2 → 24 +10 +32=66. No.

Hmm, maybe 45 isn't a common fragment. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group, but that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group, which is C2H4O, mass 44. Close, but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2OCH3 group, but that's 45? Let me calculate: CH2CH2OCH3 is C3H8O, mass 3*12 +8 +16=36+8+16=60. No, that's not right.

Another possibility: the fragment could be CH2=CH-O- . The mass of that group would be 44 (C2H4O) as before. So perhaps it's losing something else.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula of the unknown is C6H10O2, and the mass spectrum shows a fragment that's an ethylene group (m/z=28) plus something else. But the question says the peak is at 45, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a (CH3)CO+ ion, which is 58? No, that's not matching.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me recap.

From the IR, the presence of a broad peak at 3000 suggests an -OH group, so the formula must have at least one O. The 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, possibly an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl.

The NMR shows vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. So the formula must have a double bond (one degree of unsaturation).

Mass spec has a fragment at 45. So looking for a possible fragment.

Looking back, option C is C6H10O2. Let me imagine a possible structure: maybe it's an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. But that would be C6H10O2. Wait, no, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2? Let's count:

CH2=CHCOO- is C3H4O2. The other part is CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that would be four carbons, making it C7). So perhaps it's a smaller ester.

Alternatively, the structure could be a cyclic ester with a double bond, like a six-membered ring with an ester linkage and a double bond. But perhaps that's too complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, another approach: think of the possible molecular ion. For C6H10O2, the molecular weight is 114. If during fragmentation, a 45 piece breaks off, the remaining would be 114-45=69. What's 69? 69 is the molecular weight of C3H7O or C4H9O. Wait, C4H9O is 4*12 +9 +16=48+9+16=73. No, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a fragment from the ester group. For example, if the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure how that would fragment.

Alternatively, the 45 could be a glycol group or something else. I'm a bit stuck, perhaps I should think more about the IR and NMR.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an -OH group. So the compound is either an alcohol, carboxylic acid, or an ester with an -OH group. Wait, but esters typically don't have free -OH groups; if it's an ester, the -OH would be part of the ester group (like in a hemiacetal or something else? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But the IR of a carboxylic acid would have a very broad O-H stretch and a strong carbonyl peak, but the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the O-H is very broad. But in this case, the FTIR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1650 could be something else, like a conjugated double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So if it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, maybe something like CH2=CHCOOH. But that would have the formula C3H4O2. However, our options are for C6 compounds. So perhaps the compound is a longer chain with a double bond and a carboxylic acid group.

But looking at the options, the only formula with two oxygens and the right degrees is option C. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2OH. Wait, that's C7H12O3, which doesn't fit any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with a vinyl group. Like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 (ethyl vinyl ester). That's C6H10O2. Yes, that's option C.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2.

The IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1700 cm⁻¹, and perhaps the 1650 peak is the conjugated double bond (the vinyl group). The broad peak at 3000 could be from an -OH group, but wait, in an ester, the -OH is part of the ester group and is not a free -OH. Unless it's a hemiacetal or something, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an alcohol, but in that case, the formula would have an -OH group. Wait, but for option C, the formula is C6H10O2. If it's an ester, O2 makes sense (R-O-CO-O-R?), no, that can't be. Wait, esters are R-O-CO-R, so they have two oxygen atoms: one from the ester oxygen and the carbonyl. So for a simple ester like ethyl propionate, it's C5H10O2.

So in our case, the compound is C6H10O2. So maybe it's methyl vinyl ester or something similar. But I'm not sure.

In the mass spec, the fragment at 45 could be from the ester group breaking off. For example, the ester could lose the R group, leaving the O-CO- part. But the mass of O-CO would be 16 +12 +16=44. Hmm, close to 45. Perhaps the fragment is [CH2CH2O]+ or similar.

Alternatively, maybe the ester's R group is a methyl or ethyl, and the fragment is the COO- part. But I'm not certain.

Putting it all together, the IR suggests an ester or carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. The formula must be C6H10O2, which is option C.


The question involves identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on spectroscopic data: FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O. Here's the analysis:

### FTIR Analysis
- **Broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an -OH group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- **Strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), possibly from an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid.
- **Strong absorption at 1650 cm⁻¹**: Likely corresponds to a conjugated carbonyl group or a double bond.

### ¹H NMR Analysis
- Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens suggest the presence of a double bond (alkene or aromatic).

### Mass Spectrometry
- A fragment peak at m/z = 45 is observed. This could correspond to a fragment such as CH₂=CHO or a similar group.

### Degrees of Unsaturation
The degrees of unsaturation were calculated for each option:
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 0. This implies a fully saturated compound, which contradicts the presence of vinyl hydrogens (indicating a double bond). Thus, **A is eliminated**.
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1.5. Fractional degrees of unsaturation are not possible, so **B is eliminated**.
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 1. This matches the presence of one double bond, consistent with the vinyl hydrogens in the NMR.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Degrees of unsaturation = 0.5. Fractional degrees of unsaturation are not possible, so **D is eliminated**.

### Final Analysis
The only plausible option remaining is **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula aligns with the spectroscopic data:
- The IR spectrum supports the presence of a carbonyl group (ester or carboxylic acid) and a conjugated system.
- The NMR indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, consistent with a double bond.
- The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 is reasonable for a compound with this formula.

Thus, the chemical formula of the unknown compound is **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

**Answer: C**
