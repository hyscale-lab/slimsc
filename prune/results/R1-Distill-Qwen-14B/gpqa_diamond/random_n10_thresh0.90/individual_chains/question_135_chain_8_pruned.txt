Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, maybe I'm misreading that. Let me parse it. Oh, right, it's probably:

L = -λ (ψ_f)^† (ῡ + X) ψ_f.

Wait, no, that doesn't look right. Oh, perhaps it's more like a Yukawa coupling. The Lagrangian given is L = -λ f ψ̄_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f, where f might be a charge or something. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the key here is that the boson X interacts with fermions through this term.

The problem states that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We're to find which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

So, kinematics for decay. Remember, for a particle to decay into two particles, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Also, in pair production (like fermions), each fermion must have a mass less than half the parent's mass.

Wait, but since X is a boson, and the interaction term involves ψ_f, which are fermions, I think X can decay into a pair of fermions.

So the possible decay products would be fermion-antifermion pairs. The question is, which of these are allowed given the mass of X.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. Each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than 3 GeV, because 2m_f ≤ m_X.

Wait, but the fermions' masses vary. Let's list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): like 2 MeV (massless in many approximations)
- Down quark (d): around 4-5 MeV
- Strange (s): around 100 MeV
- Charm (c): about 1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top (t): around 173 GeV (way too heavy, so can't be produced here)
- Tau (τ): about 1.77 GeV
- Electron (e), muon (μ), etc.: very light, like 0.0005 GeV.

Wait, so for X to decay into a pair of fermions, each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. Let's see:

- For b quarks: mass ≈4.5 GeV. So 4.5 > 3, so can't have b quarks. So decay channels like X→b bbar are not allowed. So any option with b quark decay is out. Looking at the options:

Option A includes bb, which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option D also includes bb, so D is out.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, e, mu. Let's check their masses.

c: 1.5 GeV → 1.5 <3, so okay. s: 0.1 GeV, okay. u and d are negligible, okay. tau: 1.77 GeV → 1.77 <3, okay. So decay into tau pair is allowed. e and mu are also allowed.

What about option C? It includes top quarks, which have mass ~173 GeV, way higher than 3 GeV. So decay into t tbar is not possible. So C is out.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option D: same as B but includes bb.

Wait, earlier thought: X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into two particles, each must be less than 3 GeV.

So for tau, 1.77 GeV, so two taus would have a total mass of about 3.54 GeV. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait a second. Because the sum of the masses of the pair must be less than or equal to the mass of X. So, for X→τ+ τ-, each tau is 1.77 GeV, so 2 * 1.77 = 3.54 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, 3.54 is less than 6, so that decay is allowed. So tau is allowed. Similarly, for e and mu, which are almost massless, so definitely allowed.

But what about c quarks? Each is 1.5 GeV, so two c's would be 3 GeV, which is equal to X's mass divided by two (since X is 6 GeV). So 3 GeV is exactly half, so it's allowed. So that's fine.

So what about the c cbar decay? Yes, allowed.

Now, what about bottom quarks? As their mass is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than half of X's mass, so 2 *4.5 is 9 GeV, which is larger than 6 GeV. So decay into b quarks is impossible. So any option including b is out. So options A and D are incorrect.

Now, which about charm quarks? 1.5 GeV each. 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, they can decay into c cbar.

So the allowed decay products are all pairs where each fermion is less than 3 GeV. So which option fits?

Looking at the options:

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all these fermions have masses less than 3 GeV. So their pairs are allowed.

Option C includes t, which is way too heavy. So C is out.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, let me double-check. What about the process
