Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, okay, let's break it down. 

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected via the RV method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is less than Jupiter but more than Earth. 

The key data given is the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Oh wait, right, the RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. So the bigger the shift, the more the star is moving, which relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, but how exactly does the shift relate to these factors? I remember that the Doppler shift (or radial velocity) is related to the star's velocity. The formula I think is K = (V*sin i)/c, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps it's more about the amplitude of the star's velocity, K, which is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve. 

Oh right, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p)^3 ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²) ) )^(1/3) )^(1/3) ) * ... Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ) ... Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I remember that when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's mass (which it is, since M_p << M_*), the formula simplifies. Let me think: the formula for K is approximately K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the Doppler shift in terms of the star's velocity. The star's velocity is the same as the planet's orbital speed but in the opposite direction, scaled by the mass ratio. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the star's velocity is much smaller. 

But in this problem, both planets have the same mass (similar to Neptune), and the stars have the same mass. So the Doppler shifts depend on the orbital velocities of the stars. The higher the shift, the higher the velocity. 

Wait, the shift in wavelength is proportional to the star's velocity. So a larger shift implies a higher velocity, which would suggest a more massive planet or a shorter orbital period. Wait, no, because for a given planet mass, a shorter orbital period would mean a tighter orbit, which I think would lead to a higher velocity.

Wait, but in this case, both planets have the same mass. So the difference in Doppler shifts (Planet #1: 5, Planet #2:7) must come from the orbital velocities. So the star's velocity semi-amplitude K would be higher for Planet #2. 

But the orbital velocity of the star (K) is related to the orbital velocity of the planet. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the star's velocity is K ≈ (M_p/(M_*)) * v_p, where v_p is the planet's orbital speed. Wait, that might not be necessary.

Alternatively, considering the formula for K, which is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity. The formula is K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. The formula for K is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) * ( (1 - e²) )^(-1/2) ) )^(1/3) / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe an easier approach
