Okay, so I’ve got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm. Let me think. The question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, what does that mean exactly? Oh right, uniform distribution usually implies that the number density is the same throughout the space we're considering. So, more stars in a larger volume.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance—closer stars have larger parallaxes. Right, because parallax angle is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs, I think.

We need to find how N, the number of stars per unit plx, changes with plx. So, N as a function of plx.

Wait, parallax is inversely related to distance. So if a star is at a distance d, its parallax p is 1/d. So d = 1/p.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars in a volume V is n*V. So for a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr, because it's a spherical shell. So number of stars in that shell is n * 4πd² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Let's substitute d with 1/p, so d = 1/p → dr = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because if d increases, p decreases. So when p is small, d is large. So when we move from p to p + dp, the corresponding d would be 1/(p + dp) ≈ (1/p) - (dp/p²). Hmm, but maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of p.

So, the volume element in terms of p. Let me think. The volume of a shell at distance d is 4πd² dr. Substitute d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p². dr is the change in distance. So dr = (change in d). What's dr in terms of dp?

Since d = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. Because if p increases, d decreases. So substituting, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So the volume element dV becomes 4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) dp. Wait, that's 4π
