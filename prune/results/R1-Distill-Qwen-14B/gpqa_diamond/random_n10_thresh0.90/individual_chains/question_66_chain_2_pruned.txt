Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT framework. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. I remember it's used when you have new physics at a high energy scale, and you write down all possible interactions respecting the Standard Model gauge symmetry. But beyond that, which symmetries do the operators have to obey?

The question lists four symmetries and asks which must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are combinations of these.

Let me start by recalling each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity, including rotations, boosts, and translations. All terms in the Lagrangian must respect this, because physics is the same in all inertial frames.

2. Poincaré Symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position and time). So Poincaré implies the theory is invariant under the Poincaré group, which includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. But wait, in effective field theories, I think the Poincaré symmetry is already part of the foundation because they describe local physics, but maybe the SMEFT operators don't necessarily have to respect it if they are non-renormalizable? Hmm, or wait, no, because EFTs are low-energy and valid below some cutoff. Wait, but EFTs are still Lorentz invariant because all the physics we observe is Lorentz invariant, up to the cutoff. So I think SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, and Poincaré includes that. But wait, do they have to respect Poincaré? Because Poincaré includes momentum translations, which would relate to the energy-momentum of the system, but in EFTs, you can have terms that break Lorentz symmetry? No, wait, I think all operators in SMEFT are still required to be Lorentz invariant. Because the SMEFT is built as an effective theory of the Standard Model, which is Lorentz invariant. So all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is option 1. What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes both Lorentz and translations. But in effective theories, operators are local, so I think they must respect Poincaré as well. So both 1 and 2 would be required. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because Poincaré symmetry is more about the local symmetries, including the momentum. But in SMEFT, as an effective theory, the operators are constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, including Lorentz. So both 1 and 2 are required.

3. CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes particles to antiparticles, parity inverts spatial coordinates. CP symmetry is not automatically respected in the Standard Model. Wait, the Standard Model isn't CP symmetric. For example, CP violation exists in the CKM matrix. So, if SMEFT is an extension, the operators can violate CP, right? So the operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

4. CPT symmetry: This is the combination of Charge conjugation, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that all theories require CPT symmetry. So any operator in the theory must respect CPT. Because in a Lorentz invariant theory, CPT is a symmetry. So this symmetry must be respected.

So putting it together:

Which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry - Yes.
2. Poincaré - Hmm. Wait, Poincaré includes Lorentz. But in SMEFT, operators are written as local terms, so they're Poincaré invariant. Because Poincaré invariance includes translations, which are part of the local symmetry. So the operators must respect this as well. So yes, 2 is required.

Wait, another approach: the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators must be Lorentz scalars, making option 1 correct. But what about Poincaré? Poincaré symmetry is part of the framework, but I think that in SMEFT, the operators are built to be Lore
