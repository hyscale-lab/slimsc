Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is about the ratio of flux between two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III branch suddenly stops. 

Wait, first, I need to recall what the pp-III branch is. Oh right, in the Sun's core, fusion reactions happen, and the proton-proton chain is the main process. The pp-I branch is the initial stage where two protons fuse into deuterium, right? Then pp-II and pp-III are later steps. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is probably the part where the two protons combine via a different pathway, maybe involving a boron-8 nucleus or something like that.

But the question says the pp-III branch stopped. So all other reactions are the same. That means the proton-proton chain's pp-III part is no longer happening. So, what does that mean for the neutrinos produced?

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced through the proton-proton chain, right? The main neutrino types come from the decay of boron-8, which comes from the pp-III reactions. Wait, no, wait—actually, the proton-proton chain can proceed via different branches. The dominant one is the pp-I, which accounts for about 90% of the fusion, and the pp-II and pp-III are minor, but they contribute to higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I and pp-II. Because in the pp-III process, a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7 plus two positrons and two neutrinos. Oh wait, no, the decay of boron-8 emits positrons and neutrinos. So the neutrinos from this process would have higher energies because the binding energy of boron-8 is higher, so when it decays, the neutrinos carry more energy.

So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos (like those in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands) would be affected. Let me think about the flux in each band.

Wait, the flux is the number of neutrinos per cm² per second. So the question is, what's the ratio of flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) to band 2 (800-900 keV) after the pp-III process stops.

Wait, normally, without the pp-III, the main source of neutrinos would be from the pp-I and pp-II branches. Since the pp-III is stopped, the neutrinos in higher energy bands would decrease more than the lower ones.

Wait, in the pp-I process, the neutrinos are produced in the initial steps, which I think are lower energy. Let me think: in the pp chain, the main neutrinos are from the decay of boron-8 in the pp-III branch. So, if pp-III stops, the production of high-energy neutrinos would drop, but the lower energy ones from pp-I and pp-II would remain.

But wait, in the pp-I branch, do any neutrinos get produced? Let me recall. The pp-I branch is the main process where two protons collide to form deuterium, then another proton fuses to make helium-3, and then either it can combine with another helium-3 (that's the pp-II branch) or a helium-3 and a helium-4 (pp-III). 

Wait, in the pp-I path, the first step is proton + proton → deuterium + positron + neutrino. Oh right, so each of these steps produces a neutrino. So the first step in pp-I produces lower-energy neutrinos since it's just a proton-proton fusion with a positron emitted. The energy of that neutrino would be lower compared to the neutrinos from the pp-III branch.

So the neutrinos from the first step of pp-I are lower energy, let's say in the 200 keV range or so. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher energy neutrinos. 

Wait, the pp-III process involves helium-3 and a proton to make boron-8, which then decays into lithium-7 plus two positrons and two neutrinos. So each decay gives two neutrinos, each with higher energy. So the neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy, say around a few MeV? Or maybe a couple hundreds of keV. Hmm, maybe I should recall the typical energies.

I think the neutrinos from the main pp chain (pp-III) are around 0.5 MeV, which is about 500 keV. So the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are in the range of these higher-energy neutrinos. 

If the pp-III stops, the flux of neutrinos in higher energy bands (like 700-800 and 800-900 keV) would decrease because those neutrinos come mainly from pp-III. But the lower energy bands would remain as they were because they come from the pp-I and pp-II processes, which are still ongoing.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 (700-800) to band 2 (800-900). Before the pp-III stopped, the flux in both bands would be similar if they're both dominated by pp-III. But once pp-III stops, the flux in these high energy bands would drop. But how do the two bands compare before and after?

Wait, before pp-III stopped, the neutrinos in band 1 and 2 are both from pp-III, so their fluxes might have been similar, but perhaps the flux drops more in band 2 than in band 1 if pp-III produces more in some regions. Or perhaps the flux in band 1 and 2 are both from the same process, so they would be similarly affected.

Wait, but if pp-III stops, but the other processes continue, then the neutrinos in band 1 and 2 would be from the same source (pp-III), so their fluxes would decrease by the same amount. Wait, no, but wait, the neutrinos from other sources, like pp-I and pp-II, might contribute to lower energy bands. So if the high-energy bands lose their pp-III contributions, those fluxes drop, whereas lower energy bands might remain similar.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band 1 (700-800) to band 2 (800-900) after pp-III stops.

Before stopping, the main source for both bands is pp-III. So their fluxes would be similar. But after stopping, if those bands are only getting contributions from other processes, which are negligible, then both fluxes would be similar. But wait, the other processes (pp-I and pp-II) don't produce high-energy neutrinos. So maybe band 1 and 2 would have their fluxes drop to almost zero, but how much would each drop?

Wait, no, the
