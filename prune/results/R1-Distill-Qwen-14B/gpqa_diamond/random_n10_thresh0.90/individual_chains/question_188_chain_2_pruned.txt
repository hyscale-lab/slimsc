Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Wait, the question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, rhombohedral means all the edges are equal and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees.

The problem is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ ), but wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) but wait, wait, no, in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, so the formula simplifies, but for rhombohedral, the angles are different.

Wait, another thought: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) - 2(hk (cos α)/a² + ... ) ), but I might be mixing terms here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ), but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the correct formula. Oh right, in a rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance for (hkl) plane is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ). But wait, since in the rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, α = β = γ. So substituting that in, the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos α - 2kl cos α ).

Wait, but in this problem, the Miller indices are (111), so h=1, k=1
