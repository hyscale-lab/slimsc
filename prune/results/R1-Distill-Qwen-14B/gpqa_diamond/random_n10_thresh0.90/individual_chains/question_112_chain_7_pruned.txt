Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. 

The question says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator. 

Wait, wait. So the operator whose matrix is A_ij is such that diagonal elements are zero and off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix must be a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin states, which are two-dimensional. Let me write that matrix out.

The matrix A would look like:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

Because when i≠j, A_ij = hbar/2. So, A is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, but what operator does this represent? Hmm. Oh right, in spin systems, the Pauli matrices are often involved. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if I multiply that by some factor, perhaps. Since A_ij is (hbar/2) times the off-diagonal elements of the identity matrix. So actually, A = (hbar/2) * σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, because they're just scaled by a factor. The eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, right?

So the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates when the state is |alpha>.

Wait, but first I need to normalize |alpha>, because the question says it's proportional to that vector. So let me calculate the normalization factor.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me compute the norm. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) + any cross terms? Wait no, because when you compute the inner product, the cross terms would involve |up> and |down> being orthonormal. So <alpha|alpha> is |1+i|² + |2 -i|².

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2.

Wait, no. Wait, |a + bi|^2 is a² + b². So (1+i) has a=1, b=1 → |1+i|^2 = 1 +1 =2. Similarly, |2 -i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2=4+1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

So the state is |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|↑> + (2 -i)|↓> ].

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of the operator A, which are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |-x>.

What are |+x> and |-x> in terms of |↑> and |↓>? Oh right, the eigenstates of σ_x are (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2) and (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, σ_x is the Pauli matrix in x-direction. Its eigenvalues are ±1. So the eigenstates are |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|↑> − |↓>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, or is it the other way around? Because if I apply σ_x to |+x>, I get |+x> again. Let me think: σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in the basis |↑>, |↓>, σ_x swaps the two states. So |+x> is an equal superposition of |↑> and |↓>. So yeah, |+x> = (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2), |-x> = (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2).

So to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>, and find a and b.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |-x>.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, express |alpha> as a vector.

|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) |↑> + (2 -i)|↓> ]

In the basis |↑>, |↓>, this is represented as the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, actually, it's a column vector with first component (1+i)/sqrt(7), second component (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Now, the |+x> state is (|↑> + |↓>)/sqrt(2), so in vector form, it's [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Similarly, |-x> is (|↑> - |↓>)/sqrt(2), so vector [1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)].

To find the coefficients a and b, such that |alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>, we can compute the inner products.

a = < +x | alpha > 

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) * [1, 1] multiplied by the vector (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1) * (1+i) + (1) * (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me compute numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + i + 2 -i = 3.

So a = (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, b = < -x | alpha > 

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, -1] multiplied by the vector.

So b = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(1+i) + (-1)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Compute the numerator: (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 + i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So b = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the probabilities as |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Compute |b|^2: |(-1 + 2i)|^2 / (14).

| -1 +2i |^2 is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So |b|^2 is 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571.

Wait, but wait a second. No, because a and b are coefficients in the expansion of |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>. So the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

So probability of measuring +x is |a|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Probability of measuring -x is |b|^2 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check because the options don't have 9/14 and 5/14. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7).

Hmm. 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64, which is option A's first two numbers (0.64 and 0.36). But wait, 0.64 + 0.36 = 1, which is correct. But wait, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36. Hmm.

But wait, another thought. Did I make a mistake in calculating a and b? Let me recheck.

Wait, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|↑> + (2-i)|↓> normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2-i)/sqrt(7).

Wait, when I compute a = < +x | alpha >, it's (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 - i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the
