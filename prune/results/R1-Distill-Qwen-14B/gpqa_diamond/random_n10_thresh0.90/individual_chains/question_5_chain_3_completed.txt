Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. We're given the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are often used to represent spin operators. Each component (P_x, P_y, P_z) corresponds to the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So, maybe the operator P is a vector of these Pauli matrices. 

The way the question is phrased, I think the operator P is given in terms of its components. So P is a vector operator, and when you want the operator along a direction n, you take the dot product of P with the unit vector n. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z), which would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n must be zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is measured from the z-axis. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the polar angle.

Wait, but the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so maybe θ is the angle from the x-axis? Or perhaps the angle from the z-axis, I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, in the standard spherical coordinate system, θ is the angle from the positive z-axis, so in x-z plane, the angle would vary θ from 0 to π/2 (assuming it's in the x-z plane—like the equator would be the x-y plane). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think that the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so its components are (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² =1. So n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n·P would be sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Wait, but the operator along direction n is given by P_n = (n · P). So yes, that's right. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the y-component of n is zero.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to find the eigenvector |+> such that P_n |+> = (ħ/2)|+>.

Let me write down each component of P.

Given:

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix of P_n. Let's compute each element:

The matrix will have elements:

Top left: (ħ/2) (n_z *1 + 0) = (ħ/2) n_z
Top right: (ħ/2) (n_x *1 + 0) = (ħ/2) n_x
Bottom left: same as top right, so (ħ/2) n_x
Bottom right: (ħ/2) (n_z*(-1) + 0) = -(ħ/2) n_z

So the matrix is:

[ (ħ/2 n_z )    (ħ/2 n_x) ]
[ (ħ/2 n_x)    -(ħ/2 n_z) ]

We can factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, no, because n_x and n_z are direction cosines. So n_x² + n_z² =1.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>. Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for vectors |v> such that when P_n acts on them, they get multiplied by ħ/2.

So writing the eigenvalue equation:

[ (n_z)   n_x     ] [a]   [ (ħ/2) a ]
[ n_x    -n_z    ] [b] = [ (ħ/2) b ]

Wait, no. Because the matrix is multiplied by ħ/2. So perhaps it's better to write the equation as:

( P_n - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0

Which gives us:

(P_n - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0

So the matrix (P_n - (ħ/2) I) must be singular, so its determinant is zero.

But let me write out the matrix P_n - (ħ/2) I. Since P_n is (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ], subtracting (ħ/2) I gives:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z - 0] ] Wait, no. Wait, wait. P_n is (ħ/2)*[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. So the matrix (P_n - (ħ/2) I) would be (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] multiplied by the identity matrix, which has 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. So subtracting (ħ/2) times the identity matrix, which is [[(ħ/2), 0], [0, (ħ/2)]], from P_n:

So:

P_n - (ħ/2) I = (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

Because:

Top left: (ħ/2) n_z - (ħ/2)*1 = (ħ/2)(n_z -1)
Top right: (ħ/2) n_x - 0 = (ħ/2) n_x
Bottom left: same as top right.
Bottom right: (ħ/2)(-n_z) - (ħ/2)*1 = (ħ/2)(-n_z -1 )

Wait, no. Wait, the identity matrix has 1s on the diagonal, so when multiplied by (ħ/2), it's (ħ/2) in each diagonal element. So when subtracting, each diagonal element of P_n is (n_z * (ħ/2)) and (−n_z * (ħ/2)), and we subtract (ħ/2) from the diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write out the matrix without factoring:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So P_n - (ħ/2) I = [ [ (n_z)(ħ/2) - (ħ/2), n_x (ħ/2) ], [n_x (ħ/2), (-n_z)(ħ/2) - (ħ/2) ] ]

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

So for the eigenvalue equation, the matrix must have a non-trivial solution, so the determinant must be zero.

The determinant of the matrix (P_n - (ħ/2) I ) should be zero.

But perhaps a better approach is to write the eigenvalue equation:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) [n_z a + n_x b] = (ħ/2) a
(ħ/2) [n_x a - n_z b] = (ħ/2) b

We can divide both equations by ħ/2, leading to:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

So we have the system of equations:

( n_z a + n_x b ) - a = 0 → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0 ... (1)
n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0 ... (2)

We can write this as:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
Equation 2: n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

We can solve this system for a and b. Since eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple, we can set one variable in terms of the other.

From equation 1: (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b

Let me substitute this into equation 2.

n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0 → n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z-1) b ] - (n_z +1) b = 0

Factor out b:

[ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) - (n_z +1) ] b = 0

Since this must hold for non-zero b, the coefficient must be zero.

So:

(-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) - (n_z +1) = 0

Multiply both sides by (n_z -1):

- n_x^2 - (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = 0

Simplify (n_z +1)(n_z -1) = n_z^2 -1

So:

- n_x^2 - (n_z^2 -1) = 0 → -n_x^2 - n_z^2 +1 =0 → - (n_x^2 + n_z^2) +1 =0 → Since n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1, because n is a unit vector, this equation becomes -1 +1 =0 → 0=0.

Which is always true. So the two equations are consistent, and we can proceed.

So from equation 1, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

But since we're looking for non-zero eigenvectors, we can choose b=1 (or any non-zero value), but let's see what this gives.

Wait, but another approach is to parametrize the problem. Let's think about the eigenvectors for spin-1/2 particles. The eigenstates of S·n (spin operator along n) are the eigenstates with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So for +ħ/2, the spinor is typically written as [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T, where θ is the polar angle relative to the z-axis and φ is the azimuthal angle.

But in this problem, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so φ=0. Because it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ (around the z-axis) is zero. So the spinor would be [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T, because e^{i*0} is 1.

Wait, but that's option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector, which is a spinor. The options given are:

A) (\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)
B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (\sqrt{2/3} hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2))

Wait, but wait: the eigenvectors are typically normalized. So the spinor [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] has a norm of cos^2(theta/2) + sin^2(theta/2)=1, so it's already normalized. So that's option C.

But wait, let me think again. The spinor for the eigenstate of S·n with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is indeed (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2))^T. Because when n is along the z-axis (theta=0), the state is (1, 0), and when theta=pi, it's (0,1). So that makes sense.

But in our problem, the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi=0, so the spinor becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))^T.

So looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer would be option C.

But let me check the other options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's not the standard form. The standard form is with theta/2. So B is probably for a different parameterization.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors multiplied by hbar, which doesn't seem right, because the eigenvectors aren't scaled by ħ. They are dimensionless, as spinors. So the presence of ħ in the options is confusing. Because in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors are unit vectors in Hilbert space, so their components shouldn't have units of ħ.

Wait, looking at the given options:

Option A: Each component has sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. That can't be correct because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Option B: The components are cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). Again, doesn't match the standard form, which uses theta/2.

Option C: Correct for the spinor, normalized.

Option D: Components have sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively. So this would be the case if the direction n is along some specific axis, but the question says n is arbitrary in x-z plane, so the eigenvector should depend on theta, the angle of direction n from the z-axis.

Wait, but in the question, the eigenvector is to be written in terms of the direction n lying in the x-z plane. So perhaps the components are expressed in terms of theta, which is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, but the standard spinor for the + state is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). Since phi=0 in this case, it's (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, looking again, option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), respectively, and also multiplied by ħ. That doesn't match the expected spinor form, so I think D is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct option is C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is expressed in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The direction $\vec{n}$ is in the x-z plane, so it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$. Substituting the components of $\vec{n}$ and the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, the matrix representation of $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is derived. The eigenvalue equation $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} |v\rangle = (\hbar/2) |v\rangle$ is then solved to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.

For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of $\vec{S} \cdot \vec{n}$ (analogous to $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$) are well-known. The eigenstate with eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is given by the spinor:

\[
|+\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix},
\]

where $\theta$ is the polar angle of $\vec{n}$ from the z-axis. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is zero, and the spinor simplifies to the above form.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The components include $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B**: The components are $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$, which does not match the standard spinor form $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
- **Option C**: The components are $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$, which matches the standard spinor form for the eigenstate with eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.
- **Option D**: The components include $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which suggest a specific direction for $\vec{n}$, but the problem specifies an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Thus, this option is not general.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as it represents the normalized eigenvector for the given eigenvalue and arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane.

Answer: C
