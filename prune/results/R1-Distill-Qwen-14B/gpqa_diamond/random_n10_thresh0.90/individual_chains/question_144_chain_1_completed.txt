--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance, right?

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, and β is the velocity relative to the speed of light.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh, right, the lifetime is connected to the decay width via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the inverse of the lifetime: τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Because Γ is the total decay width, which is the energy width over which the particle decays. So Γ is related to the uncertainty in energy, and τ is the uncertainty in time, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ.

Wait, I should double-check the formula. I think the correct formula is τ = ħ / Γ. Because the decay width Γ is the total width, and the lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. That makes sense because a larger Γ means a shorter lifetime, which would mean a shorter decay distance, right.

So first, I need to calculate τ. Let's think about the units. ħ is the reduced Planck constant, which is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because ħ has units of GeV·s when using natural units where c=1.

So Γ is given as 320 MeV. Oh wait, that's 0.32 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s.

Let me compute that: 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let's see, 32 × 20 is 640, so 0.32 × 20.56 is about 6.58 (because 0.32 *20=6.4, 0.32*0.56=0.1792; 6.4+0.1792=6.5792). So 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So tau is approximately 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, no, because 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. So that's about 20.56875e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. Let me do the division correctly. 6.582 divided by 0.32. Let me compute it precisely.

0.32 × 20 = 6.4. 6.582 - 6.4 is 0.182. So 0.182 / 0.32 = 0.56875. So 20.56875. So yes, 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875. So tau is 20.56875e-25 seconds, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25, which is 20.56875 * 1e-25 s. So 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, because 20e-25 is 2e-24. So okay, 2.056875e-24 seconds is the lifetime.

Now, next, I need to find the velocity β. Because the mean decay distance is c multiplied by beta multiplied by tau.

But wait, beta is v/c. So I need to find beta for the particle X. The particle is a meson, so it's a hadron, likely a pion or something similar, but the mass is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, but wait, pion masses are around 0.14 GeV. But maybe it's a different meson.

But how do I find beta? I think I can use the energy and mass to find the velocity. The energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. The mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV.

In relativity, the total energy is E = gamma * m c². But since we're working in units where c=1 and GeV are used, E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 8/1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

Then, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So rearranging, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

So let's compute beta. Gamma is 6.6667, so gamma squared is (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/(gamma^2) is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887.

Wait, maybe a more precise calculation is needed because the options are very close. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute gamma: 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... Let me write that as 20/3. So gamma = 20/3.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2) because 1/(gamma^2) is (3/20)^2, which is 9/400.

Wait, 3/20 is 0.15, so squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is what? Let me calculate that.

I remember that sqrt(0.96) is about 0.98, sqrt(0.9775) is a bit higher. Let's compute it precisely.

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

Let me approximate this. Let me think of it as x^2 = 0.9775. Let's take x ≈ 0.988.

0.988^2 = (0.98 *10 + 0.008)^2? Wait, 0.988 squared is 0.988 *0.988.

Let me compute 988 * 988:

988^2 = (1000 -12)^2 = 1000000 - 24000 + 144 = 976144.

So 0.988^2 is 0.976144. But we need 0.9775. So current x is 0.988 gives x^2=0.976144. The target is 0.9775, which is 0.001356 higher.

Let me try 0.988 + delta, where delta is small. Let me approximate delta.

(0.988 + delta)^2 ≈ 0.988^2 + 2*0.988*delta.

Set this equal to 0.9775:

0.976144 + 2*0.988 * delta = 0.9775

So 2*0.988 * delta = 0.001356

=> delta = 0.001356 / (2 * 0.988) ≈ 0.001356 / 1.976 ≈ 0.000686.

So x ≈ 0.988 + 0.000686 ≈ 0.988686. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

So beta ≈ 0.9887.

Now, with tau and beta known, the mean decay distance is L = c * tau * beta.

Wait, let me make sure. The formula is L = c * tau * beta. Because the particle is moving at speed v = beta c, so the distance traveled during its lifetime is v * tau = beta c tau.

Yes, correct.

So, let's compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Beta is approximately 0.9887.

So L = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.9887.

Let me compute the numbers step by step.

First, compute all the multiplicative factors.

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 3 * 2.056875e(8-24) = 6.170625e-16.

Then multiply by 0.9887.

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 6.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ let's compute that.

6.170625 * 0.9887:

Well, 6 * 0.9887 ≈ 5.9322.

0.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ approximately 0.1685.

So total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.1685 = 6.1007.

So 6.1007e-16 meters.

Wait, but the options provided are in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. Looking at the options, option A is 5.02e-16, option C is 5.02e-15.

Wait, but my calculation gave approximately 6.1e-16 meters, but none of the options are exactly that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of tau. Let me recheck.

Tau is ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That part seems correct.

Then beta calculation. Hmm, wait, maybe I should compute beta more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using exact numbers would help. Let me compute gamma exactly as 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

So gamma = 20/3.

Beta squared is 1 - (3/20)^2 = 1 - (9/400) = (400-9)/400 = 391/400 = 0.9775.

So beta squared is 0.9775, so beta is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So that's correct.

So then, L = c * tau * beta.

Compute c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 meters.

Multiply by beta: 6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.100e-16 meters.

So about 6.1e-16 meters.

But looking at the options, the closest is A:5.02e-16, and D:4.06e-16. Hmm, none near 6e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me think again.

Wait, what if I used the relativistic energy equation E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. Oh wait, but in units where c=1, that's E² = p² + m².

So, E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

So p² = E² - m² = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 GeV².

So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, beta is (p c) / E, but in units where c=1, beta is p/E.

So beta = p / E = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. Which is consistent with what I had earlier.

So no mistake there.

Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation in the multiplication of the numbers.

Wait, let me re-calculate L step by step.

Compute 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s:

3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * (1e8 * 1e-24) )= 6.170625 * 1e-16 m.

Wait, 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16. So that part is correct.

Then multiply by 0.9887:

6.170625e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.170625 * 0.9887.

6 * 0.9887 = 5.9322.

0.170625 * 0.9887 ≈ 0.1686.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.1686 = 6.1008.

So 6.1008e-16 meters.

Hmm, but none of the options are near that. The options are about 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, 5e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of tau. Wait, let me double-check.

Tau is ħ / Γ. So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. That's correct.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps the decay width is given in GeV, and I should use ħ = 197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, wait, no, because ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. But perhaps if I use ħ in MeV·s, that might change the calculation.

Wait, let me think. 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 1 GeV·s is 1e3 MeV·s.

So ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV.

So tau = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-22 MeV·s) / (320 MeV) ) = (6.582e-22 / 320) s.

6.582e-22 / 320 = approx 2.056875e-24 s, which is the same as before. So no issue there.

But wait, perhaps I should have used natural units where ħ c is something else. Wait, no, I think I properly converted units.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the lifetime formula with Γ in natural units.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = c * (ħ / (Γ c)) ) * β.

Wait, no, because tau is ħ/(Γ), and L = c * tau * beta.

Wait, let me write it in terms of units.

c is in m/s.

Tau is in seconds.

So L = (m/s) * s * (dimensionless) → meters.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of beta.

Wait, let me compute beta more precisely.

p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) = approx 7.91 GeV.

So beta = p/E = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

But I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(62.56):

62.56 is between 7.9^2 =62.41 and 7.91^2=62.5681.

Wait, 7.91^2 = (7.9 + 0.01)^2 = 7.9^2 + 2*(7.9)(0.01) + 0.01^2 = 62.41 + 0.158 + 0.0001= 62.5681.

So sqrt(62.56) is approximately 7.90997.

So p = 7.90997 GeV.

So beta = 7.90997 / 8 = 0.98874625.

So beta is approximately 0.988746.

So when I compute L:

3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s * 0.988746.

So 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.170625e-16 m.

6.170625e-16 * 0.988746 = ?

Compute 6.170625 * 0.988746.

Let me do this precisely:

6.170625 * 0.988746.

Break it down:

6 * 0.988746 = 5.932476.

0.170625 * 0.988746.

Compute 0.170625 * 0.988746:

0.1 * 0.988746 = 0.0988746.

0.07 * 0.988746 = 0.06921222.

0.000625 * 0.988746 ≈ 0.000618.

Add them up: 0.0988746 + 0.06921222 = 0.16808682 + 0.000618 = 0.16870482.

So total 6.170625 * 0.988746 ≈ 5.932476 + 0.16870482 =6.10118082.

So L ≈ 6.10118e-16 m.

Hmm, that's about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the decay width is given as the total width, but the formula for the mean path uses the natural line width or something else.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the mean lifetime is tau = hbar * (m) / (Gamma), but wait, no, because for a Breit-Wigner distribution, the width is Gamma, and the lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, but I should have converted it to GeV earlier.

Wait, in the problem statement, Gamma is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV, which I used correctly.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = c * tau * beta * gamma. Wait, no, because beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1-beta²). Wait, but the expression I used earlier is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, no, because beta gamma is (v/c) * gamma. But in any case, let me think about how the mean lifetime is computed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total decay width in the rest frame, then get the lifetime, then find the velocity, and then compute the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the velocity using the relativistic relation between energy and mass.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the formula for the decay length as L = c * (hbar * c) / (m * Gamma) ) * (E / m -1) )

Wait, no, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the decay length as L = (c^2 * tau) / (m) * (E / m -1). Wait, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula L = (c * tau) * beta gamma.

Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me think.

The mean decay length is L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, because tau is the proper lifetime, and the observed lifetime is gamma tau, so the time is gamma tau. So distance is v * t = beta c * gamma tau.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

Ah, that's another way to write it.

So L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, so if I compute beta gamma, that's (v/c) * gamma.

So let me compute beta gamma.

Wait, beta is v/c = 0.988746, gamma is 20/3 ≈6.666667.

So beta gamma is 0.988746 * 6.666667 ≈ 6.600.

So then, L = beta gamma c tau.

So beta gamma is about 6.6, c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.6 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Compute 6.6 * 3e8 = 1.98e9.

1.98e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.98e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.98 *2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.98 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.064.

So L ≈4.064e-15 meters.

Oh, that's approximately 4.06e-15 meters, which matches option B and C.

Wait, wait, looking back at the options:

A)5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B)4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m

So 4.06e-15 is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. So I had a wrong approach earlier, using L = c * tau * beta, but that gave me 6e-16 m, which isn't an option. But when I use L= beta gamma c tau, I get 4.06e-15, which is option B.

But why is that? Let me think again.

The proper formula for the mean decay length is indeed L = c * beta gamma * tau. Because the lifetime observed is gamma times the proper lifetime, and the velocity is beta c, so distance is beta c * gamma tau.

So yes, L = beta gamma c tau.

So in this case, beta gamma is approximately 6.6 (0.9887 * 6.6667), which is about 6.6.

So (6.6) * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = 6.6 *3e8*2.056875e-24.

Compute 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.6: 6.170625e-16 *6.6 ≈4.068e-15.

So L≈4.068e-15 m, which is about option B, 4.0655e-15.

So that's the correct approach.

Wait, why did the initial approach give me a different answer? Because I forgot to include the gamma factor in the formula. The mean decay length is not just c * beta * tau, but c * beta * gamma * tau.

So the correct formula is L = c * beta gamma * tau.

So I should have used that. Hence, the correct answer is option B.

Let me recap: by using the correct formula, I get L ≈4.0655e-15 m, which is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance, we use the formula:

\[
L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \beta = v/c \) is the velocity of the particle as a fraction of the speed of light,
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the lifetime of the particle, and
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), and the decay width is \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \) and \( \gamma \)
The energy of the particle is \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), and its mass is \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \). The Lorentz factor is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity fraction \( \beta \) is calculated using:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{400}} = \sqrt{\frac{391}{400}} \approx 0.9887.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = c \cdot \beta \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau \):

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (0.9887) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot \tau \):

\[
c \cdot \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}.
\]

Next, multiply by \( \beta \cdot \gamma \):

\[
\beta \cdot \gamma = 0.9887 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 6.6.
\]

Thus:

\[
L = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.6 \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to option **B**.

ANSWER: B
