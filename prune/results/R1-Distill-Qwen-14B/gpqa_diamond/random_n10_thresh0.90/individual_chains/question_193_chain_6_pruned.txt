Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance. They've observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, or N = k / plx^5, where k is some constant.

But the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance. So I think I need to relate parallax (plx) to distance (r) and then express N in terms of r.

I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1 / r, where plx is in parsecs and r is in parsecs too. So plx = 1/r. That means r = 1/plx, right? So if I can express everything in terms of r, maybe I can find how N depends on r.

Let me substitute plx into the N equation. Since N is proportional to 1/plx^5, substituting plx = 1/r gives:

N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5.

Let's compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that is r^5. So 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. Therefore, N is proportional to r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait a second, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So when r increases, what happens to N? If N increases with r^5, then as you go further out, the number of stars increases rapidly.

Wait, but the question is about the change per unit distance. Wait, no, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" Hmmm. So perhaps it's about the rate of change, like the derivative, or the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The way N varies with parallax is 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5). Since plx = 1/r, substituting gives:

N = k * (1/( (1/r)^5 )) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So as the distance r increases, the number of stars in that region increases with r^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, maybe it's the number density, like stars per unit volume? Or perhaps they're considering a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr, and how many stars are in that shell.

If that's the case, then the number of stars in a thin shell would be the number density times the volume of the shell. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πr² dr, but wait, the problem says "region of the sky," which makes me think it's a volume perhaps, but maybe it's a thin slice. Alternatively, it could be a fixed solid angle, so the volume is proportional to r² dr. Hmm.

Wait, the number of stars in a region could be determined by the volume of that region. If we're looking at a given solid angle, the volume would be (2π r dr) for a cylinder if you imagine looking at a certain depth dr. But perhaps for a spherical region, but I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, let's think about it in terms of distance. Suppose you have a region of the sky. For each unit of distance r, how many stars are there. Since N is proportional to r^5, does that mean that the number of stars increases as we move away? But wait, that's not how stars are in the universe. Wait, maybe the question is more theoretical and not about the real universe.

Wait, in reality, the number of stars doesn't increase with distance because beyond a certain point, there are no more stars. But this question
