Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully. 

The question says that X is a meson resonance and asks for the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the formula involves the lifetime τ, which is connected to the width Γ. The uncertainty principle says that Γ is the energy uncertainty, so τ is inversely proportional to Γ. The formula is τ = ħ/(Γ), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

But wait, what about the decay length? Decay length L is the product of the particle's velocity v and the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ. I think that's right. So putting it together, L = v * ħ / Γ.

But wait, how do I find the velocity v of the meson X? Because the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass. Since E is much larger than m (8 GeV vs 1.2 GeV), it's probably ultra-relativistic, so v is approximately c. But I shouldn't be too hasty. Let me think.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c². The relativistic gamma factor is γ = E/(m c²). So gamma here would be 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666..., so approximately 6.667. 

Then, the velocity v can be found using beta (β) since β = v/c. The relation between gamma and beta is γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So let me solve for beta.

Let me compute β. So for γ = 6.667, 1/γ² is 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. Then 1 - β² = 1/(γ²) => β² = 1 - 1/(γ²) = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. So β = sqrt(0.9775). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. Close enough to c, but not exactly. So for a more accurate calculation, I should use v = β c.

Now, putting it all together. The lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, let me get the units right. Γ is given in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV (since 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV). So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0569e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L = v * τ. v is β c. So L = β c τ.

Beta is approximately 0.9887, so let's take that as 0.9887. c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So τ is 2.0569e-24 s. Multiply by v (β c):

L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 3e8 m/s * 2.0569e-24 s = 3 * 2.0569e-16 = 6.1707e-16 meters.

Then multiply by 0.9887: 6.1707e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.109e-16 m.

Wait, that's about 6.1e-16 meters. But looking at the options, they're all in the 1e-15 or 1e-16 range. Hmm. Wait, the options are A)5.02...e-16, B)4.06e-15, C)5.02e-15, D)4.06e-16.

Wait, none of the options are around 6.1e-16. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate τ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So τ = (6.582e-25)/(0.32) s.

Compute 6.582 / 0.32: 6.582 ÷ 0.32. Let me compute that. 0.32 * 20 =6.4, so 20.568 would be 0.32 * 20.568 =6.582. So 6.582 /0.32 =20.568e-25 s. So τ is 2.0568e-24 s. That part is correct.

Then, v = β c. So β is sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)) = sqrt(1 - (1/(44.444)) ) = sqrt(0.977778) ≈ 0.9888 as before.

So L = v τ = 0.9888 * c * τ.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s, τ is 2.0568e-24 s.

So c * τ is 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s = 3 * 2.0568e-16 = 6.1704e-16 m.

Multiply that by beta (0.9888): 6.1704e-16 *0.9888 ≈ 6.102e-16 m.

Hmm. But the options are all lower than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v. Maybe I should use a better approximation for beta when gamma is large.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is different. Oh wait, wait. Maybe I should calculate the mean lifetime correctly considering the relativistic effects.

Wait, another approach: The mean proper lifetime τ_0 (proper time) is ħ/(Γ c²) ? Wait no, the natural units may complicate things. Let me think in natural units first.

In natural units, c=1, ħ=1. So the lifetime τ_0 is 1/(Γ), but wait, no. Because Γ is the width, which in natural units is inverse time. So τ_0 = ħ/(Γ) when using SI units.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about units.

Γ is the decay width, which has units of energy (MeV or GeV). The uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So Δt ≈ ħ / ΔE. So τ is approximately ħ / (Γ). So that part is correct.

But when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer. The observed lifetime is τ = γ τ_0, where τ_0 is the proper lifetime. So τ_0 = ħ/(Γ c²) ?

Wait, maybe I should correct my units. Because in the formula, the energy and mass are in GeV, but when calculating τ, the units must be in seconds.

Wait, let me recast the formula properly.

Γ is in GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV = 0.32e9 eV.

But I think I should convert units properly. Let me compute τ in seconds.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. So τ = ħ/(Γ) = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s = 20.56875 * 1e-25 s => 2.056875e-24 seconds.

That's correct. Then, the velocity v is β c. So beta is sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ). Since E is much larger than m, beta is approximately 1, but let's calculate it exactly.

E = 8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

Beta squared is 1 - (m c² / E )^2.

Wait, but in natural units, E = γ m, so beta is sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1.2^2)/(8^2)) = sqrt(1 - 1.44/64) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So same as before.

So then, the decay length is L = v * τ = beta c * τ.

Which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Compute 3e8 * 2.0568e-24 = 6.1704e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.1704e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.102e-16 m.

Wait, but the options are all lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay length is calculated using the mean energy, or something else. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the particle's speed as c, neglecting any relativistic effects, but that doesn't make sense because E is given as 8 GeV, which is much higher than its rest mass.

Wait, wait a second. Another approach: The decay length is often approximated as L ≈ c τ. Because when gamma is high, beta approaches 1, so L ≈ c * τ.

In that case, L = c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.0568e-24 s.

So L = 3e8 * 2.0568e-24 = 6.1704e-16 m.

But again, the options don't match this. So perhaps the calculation is correct, but I have to think about the given options.

Looking at the options: 

A)5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, my calculation is around 6.1e-16 m, but the closest option is A)5.02e-16 and D)4.06e-16. Hmm.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me recalculate beta more accurately.

Gamma is E / m c^2, but since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps better to compute beta correctly.

Wait, in natural units, where c=1 and ħ=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = E/(m c²) but since in natural units, m c² is m (in GeV/c² * c² = GeV), so gamma = E/(m) = 8/1.2 = 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2)).

gamma^2 is (8/1.2)^2 = (20/3)^2 ≈ (6.6667)^2 = 44.4444.

So 1/(gamma^2) is 1/44.444≈ 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

So beta is sqrt(0.9775) = approximately 0.9887.

Hmm, but perhaps more accurately, sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute it precisely.

0.9775 is between 0.96 (0.98^2) and 0.9801 (0.99^2). Let me compute sqrt(0.9775).

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach: 0.9775 = (0.9887)^2?

0.9887^2 = (approx) 0.9887 * 0.9887. Let's compute that.

0.98 * 0.98 = 0.9604.

0.98 * 0.0087 = 0.008526.

0.0087 * 0.98 = same as above.

0.0087 * 0.0087 is about 0.00007569.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.9887 * 0.9887:

= (0.98 + 0.0087) * (0.98 + 0.0087) 

= 0.98^2 + 2*0.98*0.0087 + 0.0087^2

= 0.9604 + 2*0.008526 + 0.00007569

= 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775, so beta is 0.9887. So that seems accurate.

So L = beta c tau = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0568e-24 s.

Wait, 3e8 * 2.0568e-24 = 6.1704e-16 m.

Multiply by 0.9887: 6.1704e-16 * ~0.9887 = approx 6.103e-16 m.

Hmm. Now, looking at the options, none of them match this. Did I perhaps make a mistake in the calculation of tau?

Wait, let me check the calculation of tau again.

Tau = ħ / Gamma.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV.

ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Gamma is given in MeV, but I converted it to GeV, which is correct. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So that's right.

Another thought: Maybe the formula for decay length uses the particle's speed in terms of beta, which is v = beta c, but perhaps the proper lifetime is gamma multiplied by the lifetime at rest.

Wait, the proper lifetime tau_0 is the lifetime when the particle is at rest, so tau = gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is ħ/(Gamma c^2) ?

Wait, perhaps I should not use natural units. Let me try to compute tau_0.

In natural units, tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). But when you convert to SI units, you must consider the units.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from unit conversion. Let me try to compute tau in seconds correctly.

Gamma = 0.32 GeV = 0.32e9 eV.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s = 6.582e-25 * 1e9 eV·s = 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (0.32e9 eV) )= (6.582e-16 / 0.32e9) s = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25 s.

Which is 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. So same as before.

So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the decay length as L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Wait, because in the lab frame, the lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0.

Wait, no. The decay length is L = v * tau, where tau is the lifetime in the lab frame. So tau is gamma tau_0.

So in that case, L = v * gamma tau_0.

But wait, v = beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau_0.

Wait, but tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma).

Wait, let me think. The proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma c²) ?

Wait, perhaps including c². Because Gamma has units of energy, and tau_0 has units of seconds.

Wait, the decay width is Gamma (in GeV), and the Planck constant is ħ (in GeV·s). So tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma).

But wait, in natural units, c=1, so it's correct. But when converting to SI units, perhaps I should include the c².

Wait, perhaps I should rederive it.

The natural formula is tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma). But Gamma is in the same units as ħ. So in natural units, yes, but when using SI units, I need to be careful.

Let me think again: The decay width Gamma has units of energy (GeV). The Planck constant ħ has units of J·s, which is (GeV·s) when we consider that 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute using the value of ħ in J·s and Gamma in J.

But that might be lengthy, but perhaps more accurate.

So, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Gamma is 320 MeV. 320 MeV is 320e6 eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So Gamma = 320e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 5.1264e-11 J.

So tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.1264e-11 J) ) = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's the same as before. So tau_0 is 2.057e-24 s.

But wait, tau_0 is the proper lifetime. The observed lifetime in the lab is tau = gamma * tau_0.

So tau = gamma * tau_0 = (8 GeV / 1.2 GeV) ) * 2.057e-24 s = (6.6667) * 2.057e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Wait, that's a much longer time. Now, the velocity v is beta c, which is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

So decay length L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s = 4.065e-15 m.

Ah! Now, that's 4.065e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option D is 4.0655e-16 m. So option B is 4.0655e-15, which matches.

Wait, but I thought earlier I was getting 6e-16 m, but that was using tau as the proper time. But correct approach is to calculate tau as gamma * tau_0. So I must have made a mistake earlier. 

Wait, why the discrepancy? Because I think earlier I took tau as tau_0 and didn't account for the gamma factor.

So the correct steps are:

1. Compute tau_0 = ħ / Gamma.

2. Compute gamma = E/(m c^2) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

3. tau = gamma * tau_0 = 6.6667 * (6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV) ) = 6.6667 * (2.056875e-24 s) ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

4. Compute velocity v = beta c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

5. Decay length L = v * tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s ≈ let's compute:

2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.371 ≈ 4.065.

So 4.065e-15 m.

Which matches option B:4.0655e-15 m and option C:5.02e-15.

Wait, wait, options are:

A)5.0223 * 10^-16 m
B)4.0655 * 10^-15 m
C)5.0223 * 10^-15 m
D)4.0655 * 10^-16 m.

So option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is the same as our result.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the decay length was beta c tau, but tau was the proper time, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to realize that the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by gamma, so tau = gamma tau_0.

So the correct calculation gives L ≈4.065e-15 m, which is option B.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation steps.

Gamma is 0.32 GeV. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Tau_0 = ħ / Gamma = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0568e-24 s.

Gamma factor gamma = E / m =8/1.2=6.6667.

Tau = gamma * tau_0 =6.6667 * 2.0568e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

v=beta c=0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

L= v tau = 2.966e8 m/s * 1.371e-23 s.

Compute 2.966e8 * 1.371e-23 = (2.966 * 1.371) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.371 is approximately:

2.966 *1=2.966

2.966 *0.3=0.8898

2.966 *0.07=0.20762

2.966 *0.001=0.002966

Adding up: 2.966 +0.8898=3.8558 +0.20762=4.0634 +0.002966≈4.0664.

So 4.0664e-15 m, which approximates to 4.066e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the decay length \( L \), the particle's velocity \( v \), and the lifetime \( \tau \):  
\[
L = v \tau
\]  
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the uncertainty principle:  
\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]  
where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \)) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). Substituting these values:  
\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0568 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]  

Next, the velocity \( v \) is calculated using the relativistic relation:  
\[
v = \beta c, \quad \text{where } \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}}
\]  
Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):  
\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.2^2}{8^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1.44}{64}} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]  
Thus, \( v \approx 0.9887 \cdot c \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
\[
v \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]  

Finally, the decay length is:  
\[
L = v \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.0568 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 6.102 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]  

However, the problem specifies that the lifetime \( \tau \) should account for the relativistic time dilation factor \( \gamma \), where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667 \). The observed lifetime in the lab frame is:  
\[
\tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 6.6667 \cdot 2.0568 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.371 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]  
Recomputing the decay length with this corrected \( \tau \):  
\[
L = v \tau = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (1.371 \times 10^{-23}) \approx 4.065 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]  

This matches option **B**, which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).  

Answer: B
