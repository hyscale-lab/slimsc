Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The task is to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A to D, with various exponents of eV.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The product of the energy uncertainty and the time uncertainty must be greater than or equal to h-bar over 2, or maybe h/(2π), depending on the formulation. But wait, I think the main idea is that the energy uncertainty ΔE times the time Δt is about h/(2π). So ΔE ~ h/(Δt * 2π).

So to distinguish between two energy levels, their energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, we can't tell them apart—they would be considered the same energy level experimentally.

Let me think about the lifetimes. The lifetime here is probably the time Δt over which the system is observed. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be h/(Δt * 2π). Wait, but wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of natural units where ħ is involved.

Alternatively, the energy uncertainty ΔE is ħ/(Δt), but wait, no. Heisenberg's principle says ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is about ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, but in this question, do we consider each state's uncertainty individually? Because each state has its own lifetime. Alternatively, perhaps we're considering the time resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, the system is in a state that's a superposition of E1 and E2. The energy difference would determine how quickly the interference happens. But maybe that's a different aspect. Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the lifetimes of the states and the energy resolution needed to distinguish them.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So that you can resolve E1 and E2 as separate peaks, for example.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2 * 1e-9). Similarly, for E2, Δt is 1e-8, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

But if we want to resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty in each measurement.

Wait, maybe the combined uncertainty. But perhaps the individual ΔE's for each state. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution required is given by the inverse of the maximum time, or something else.

Wait, wait. Let me think in terms of frequencies. Energy is E = ħω, so ΔE = ħ Δω. And time is related to frequency as Δt ≈ 1/Δω. So the uncertainty in time and frequency are inversely related.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find the minimum energy difference required so that the beats or interference between the two states can be observed over their lifetimes.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be such that the two states don't have their signals blur into each other. So the time it takes for the state to decay (lifetime) must be enough to observe the energy difference.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's approach it step by step.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/(2π). So to have a clear distinction between E1 and E2, their energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

So for state 1, ΔE1 = ħ/(2πΔt1) = (hbar)/(2π * 1e-9 s). Similarly, for state 2, ΔE2 = (hbar)/(2π * 1e-8 s).

Wait, but to resolve E1 and E2, the energy difference between them should be larger than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if ΔE is larger than both uncertainties, then you can clearly see the separation.

Wait, maybe the other way: the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty you have in each measurement. So the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in energy for each state. So the energy difference needs to be bigger than the uncertainty of each state.

Wait, but each state's uncertainty is different. State 1 has a shorter lifetime (Δt=1e-9 s) which leads to a larger ΔE, because ΔE ~ 1/Δt. Similarly, state 2 has Δt=1e-8, so smaller ΔE.

So the maximum uncertainty comes from the state with the shorter lifetime, which is state 1. So the energy difference must be larger than ΔE1.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of both. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me calculate the numbers.

Compute ΔE for each state.

We'll use the formula ΔE ≈ ħ/(2π Δt) because ΔE * Δt = ħ/(2π). So rearranged, ΔE = ħ/(2π Δt).

What's ħ in eV·s? Let me recall. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But we need to convert this into eV·s. Since 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J, so ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) = approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for state 1, Δt = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ / (2π Δt) ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * π * 1e-9 s) )

Compute that denominator: 2 * π ≈ 6.283. So 6.283e-9 s.

So ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 ) / (6.283e-9 ) = approx (6.582 /6.283 ) * 1e-7 ≈ 1.047 * 1e-7 eV ≈ 1e-7 eV.

Similarly, for state 2, Δt=1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = (6.582e-16 )/(2π * 1e-8 )

Denominator is 6.283e-8 s.

So 6.582e-16 / 6.283e-8 = 1.047e-8 eV ≈ 1e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 1e-7 eV, ΔE2 about 1e-8 eV.

So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference ΔE between them must be larger than the maximum of these two uncertainties. Because if ΔE is larger than both, then you can separate them.

Wait, but which one is larger? ΔE1 is 1e-7 eV, which is larger than ΔE2's 1e-8 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be larger than 1e-7 eV. Otherwise, you can't resolve them.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → too small, 1e-9 < 1e-7.

B) 1e-11 → way too small.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV, which is larger than 1e-7. So could this be the answer?

Wait, but wait. Are we considering the sum of the uncertainties, or the larger of the two? Because for each state, the uncertainty is about the energy measurement. So for state 1, you can't resolve anything smaller than 1e-7 eV. For state 2, you can't resolve anything smaller than 1e-8 eV. So the more restrictive condition is 1e-7 eV, so ΔE must be bigger than 1e-7 eV.

But looking at the options, option C is 1e-4, which is 100 times larger than 1e-7 (since 1e-4 is 1e3 larger than 1e-7, sorry, wait no, 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7? No, wait 1e-4 is 1e3 times 1e-7, since 1e-7 * 1e3 = 1e-4.

Wait, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6, and 1e-4 is 1e-4, which is 1e3 * 0.1e-6 = 1e-4? No, wait:

Actually, 1e-7 is 0.1e-6. 1e-4 is 1e-4. So 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, which is 1000 times larger than 1e-7. So 1e-4 is 1000 times larger than 1e-7.

So any energy difference larger than 1e-7 eV would be resolvable. So if the options have 1e-4, that is way larger, so it would be resolvable. So the correct option is C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the question states that the two states have different lifetimes. So perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference needs to be larger than the product of the two uncertainties, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, think about the scenario. When you have two states with lifetimes tau1 and tau2, and you want to resolve their energy difference ΔE. The uncertainty in the energy of each state is about ħ/(tau_i). So to resolve E1 and E2, the
