Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a certain nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So Li has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6, so the mass is about 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, the exact mass might not matter because I think I can use the rest mass in terms of energy later.

The question is about the energy of the RHIC so that the speed v is 0.96c. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus. I remember that in relativity, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m*c²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So first, I should find gamma when v is 0.96c. Let me compute that. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) ). Simplify that: 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. So the denominator becomes sqrt(0.0784). What's the square root of 0.0784? Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me be precise. 1 / 0.28 = 100 / 28 ≈ 3.57142857. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is its rest mass m multiplied by c squared. But I need to express this in GeV. So I should find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus in GeV/c². Wait, I remember that 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c². Since the nucleus has a mass of 6 u, the rest mass energy is 6 * 0.9315 GeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 0.9315 = 5.589 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV. Let me calculate that. 3.5714 * 5.589.

Let me see: 3 times 5.589 is 16.767. 0.5714 times 5.589 is approximately 3.196. So adding them: 16.767 + 3.196 is about 19.963 GeV. Hmm, but let me do the exact calculation to be precise.

Wait, 3.5714 * 5.589.

I'll do it step by step. Let me compute 3.5714 * 5 = 17.857, and 3.5714 * 0.589.

Wait, 0.589 * 3.5714 ≈ let's compute 0.5 * 3.5714 = 1.7857, and 0.08 * 3.5714=0.2857, and 0.009 *3.5714≈0.0321. Adding those: 1.7857 + 0.2857 = 2.0714; +0.0321 = 2.1035. So 3.5714 * 5.589 = 3.5714*(5 + 0.589) = 17.857 + 2.1035 = 19.9605 GeV. So approximately 19.96 GeV.

Wait, looking at the options provided:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, my calculation gives about 19.96 GeV, which is close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. But wait, perhaps my approximation for gamma is a bit off or I didn't calculate everything correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me double-check the gamma calculation. v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714286.

Now, the rest energy: each nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Wait, wait, if I use a more precise value for the mass of Li-6.

Wait, Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). So I should double-check that. Because the exact mass of a nucleus isn't just A u, because of binding energy. Oh wait, that's a point I might have missed. Wait, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than A u due to the mass defect. So perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, but without exact numbers, perhaps the problem assumes that the mass is 6 u, which is an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use m = 6 u. Let me think.

Alternatively, Li-6's actual mass is about 6.013 u. So let me see. If I use 6.013 u, then the rest mass energy is 6.013 * 931.5 MeV. Let me compute that.

6.013 * 931.5 = Let's compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. Then, 0.013 * 931.5 ≈ 12.1095 MeV, which is 0.0121095 GeV. So total rest energy is approximately 5.589 + 0.0121 ≈ 5.6011 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the problem expects me to use the exact mass or not. The problem statement says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so Li-6. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 atomic mass units. So let's proceed with that.

So E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714286 * 5.6011 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714286 * 5.6011.

3.5714286 * 5 is 17.857143.

3.5714286 * 0.6011 is approximately:

0.6 *3.5714286 = 2.1428572.

0.0011 *3.5714286≈ 0.00392857.

So adding those, 2.1428572 + 0.00392857 ≈ 2.1467858.

So total E = 17.857143 + 2.1467858 ≈ 20.003929 GeV.

So approximately 20.004 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, so maybe my approximation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is more accurately 6.013 u. So 6.013 * 931.5 MeV = ?

6 * 931.5 = 5589, 0.013 *931.5=12.1095, so total is 5601.1095 MeV or 5.6011095 GeV.

So using gamma as 3.5714286, multiply by 5.6011095.

So 3.5714286 *5.6011095.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.5714286 *5 = 17.857143.

3.5714286 * 0.6011095 = ?

Let me calculate 3.5714286 *0.6 = 2.14285716.

3.5714286 * 0.0011095 = approximately 0.003958.

So adding those: 2.14285716 + 0.003958 ≈ 2.146815.

So total E is 17.857143 + 2.146815 = 20.003958 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.004 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's a bit higher. My calculation is around 20 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) where v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784.

So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a particle moving at that speed, so its kinetic energy is (gamma-1) m c^2. Oh wait, wait, the question is about the total energy. Or is it?

Wait, the question says, what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c.

RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so the energy would be the total energy, not just the kinetic.

So E = gamma m c².

So with gamma 3.5714286 and m c² =5.6011 GeV, E is approximately 20.004 GeV.

But none of the options exactly match that. The option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the mass?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass. Let's find the exact value of Li-6's mass in atomic mass units.

A quick lookup in my mind: the atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0132898 u.

So m =6.0132898 u.

So m c² =6.0132898 *931.5 MeV.

Wait, 6 *931.5=5589, 0.0132898 *931.5 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.5=9.315, 0.0032898 *931.5 ≈ 3.064. So total 9.315 +3.064=12.379 MeV. So 5589 + 12.379 = 5601.379 MeV, which is 5.601379 GeV.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.5714286 *5.601379.

Let me compute 3.5714286 *5.601379.

Let me do this step by step.

Compute 3.5714286 *5 =17.857143.

Compute 3.5714286 *0.601379.

Hmm, 0.6 *3.5714286 =2.14285716.

Then 0.001379 *3.5714286 ≈ 0.004934.

So 0.601379 is 0.6 +0.001379.

So 2.14285716 +0.004934 ≈2.147791.

So adding to the 17.857143 we get 17.857143 +2.147791 =20.004934 GeV.

So approximately 20.0049 GeV.

Looking again at the options, none exactly match. The options are A:18.475, B:23.069, C:20.132, D:21.419.

Hmm. So 20 GeV is close to option C (20.1
