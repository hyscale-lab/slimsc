Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution.

Alright, let's start by understanding what's given. We have a Co(II) solution with a concentration of 1e-2 M. The thiocyanate (SCN-) concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, I'm a bit confused about what these betas correspond to. Usually, stability constants are for complexes in order of their formation. So I think β1 is for the first complex, CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^+, and so on up to β4, which would be Co(SCN)_4^2- or something like that.

The problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I remember that in cobalt complexes, different SCN- ligand counts give different colors. The blue one is typically the tetrathiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)_4^2-, which is the fourth complex. So we're looking for the fraction of Co that's in the β4 complex.

So the approach here is to calculate the fraction of each complex and find the percentage of the β4 complex. Since all the Co is distributed among the different complexes, the sum of their fractions should be 1.

Stability constants are given, so I can use them to find the fraction of each complex. The general formula for the fraction of a complex is (β^n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 ), but wait, I think each β includes the previous ones. No, actually, βn is the formation constant for the nth complex, which is the stepwise addition of each SCN-.

Wait, no, stability constants are cumulative. Or wait, no, in this case, each β is the overall stability constant for the complex up to that point. For example, β1 is K1 = [CoSCN+]/[Co^2+][SCN^-]. β2 would be K1*K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^+]/[Co^2+][SCN^-]^2. Wait, no, maybe each β is the stepwise formation constant. So β1 is K1, β2 is K2, etc. So the formation of each complex is a stepwise process.

But sometimes, stability constants can be given in two ways: as stepwise (each step) or overall (each subsequent step). I need to clarify this. But in the problem statement, it says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I think βn is the overall stability constant for the nth complex. So:

β1 = K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]) = 9

β2 = K1*K2 = [Co(SCN)_2^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40

Similarly, β3 = K1*K2*K3 = [Co(SCN)_3^- ] / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3) = 63

β4 = K1*K2*K3*K4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4) )=16

Wait, but that can't be, because if β1 is 9, then β2 being 40 would imply that K2 = β2 / β1 = 40/9 ≈4.444. Then β3 would be K1*K2*K3=63. So K3=63/(9 * (40/9)) )=63/(40)=1.575. And K4=β4/β3=16/63≈0.254.

But I'm not sure if that's the right way to think about it. Alternatively, perhaps βn is the cumulative constant up to n. That is, β1 is the first, β2 is the first and second steps multiplied, etc. So the way to find the fraction would be to calculate each species' concentration relative to Co^2+.

Another approach: Let's consider that the total concentration of Co is the sum of all species: [Co^2+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)_2^+] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = c_total.

But since the total concentration is given, c(Co) = 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all these species. But when dealing with stability constants, it's often easier to express the fractions in terms of the formation steps.

Wait, but considering the very high [SCN-] (0.1 M) compared to the [Co], which is 0.01 M, the solution is SCN- rich. So the distribution of Co species will be shifted towards the higher complexes.

The problem is to find the percentage of Co in the β4 complex, which is the fourth species. So, I think the way to find the fraction is to compute each species' contribution relative to the others.

Let me think about the general approach. So, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. For each species, the concentration can be written as:

[Co^n] = [Co^2+] * β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN^-]^n

Wait, no, more accurately, each step's stability constant adds another ligand. So for the first complex, [CoSCN+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

The second complex, [Co(SCN)_2^+] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

Wait, no, that's not right because each βn is the overall for the nth complex. So, the nth complex's concentration is [Co(SCN)_n^{charge}] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

Wait, that can't be. Because βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. So for the first complex, [CoSCN+] = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

For the second, [Co(SCN)_2^+] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

Wait, but that would imply that β2 is [Co(SCN)_2^+]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2) = 40. Similarly, β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^- ]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )=63, and β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^2-]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )=16.

Wait, but that's the way I thought before. So then, each species is given by their respective β multiplied by [Co^2+] and [
