Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). I remember that the Lagrangian tells us about the interactions between particles. So, the boson X is interacting with fermions because there are fermionic fields ψ_f there.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So, when it decays, the total energy released must be at least the sum of the masses of the decay products. Because in particle physics, for a decay to be possible, the rest mass of the decaying particle must be greater than or equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

Looking at the options, they all have pairs like b bbar, c cbar, etc. I need to figure out which fermions can be produced when X decays.

First, let's list all the possible fermion pairs X can decay into. The Lagrangian term is λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So, the interaction is proportional to the fermion field. That means X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that the term allows. So, which fermions are present in the model? The problem probably assumes the Standard Model fermions.

In the Standard Model, the fermions are quarks (u, d, c, s, t, b) and leptons (e, mu, tau). For each generation, up and down, charm and strange, top and bottom, etc.

But wait, the interaction term here is written as -λf ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f. So, X couples to all fermions because the term is general for ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion pair.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So let's look at the masses of the possible fermions.

Top quark is way too heavy, around 173 GeV. X can't decay into t tbar because 6 GeV is way less than 2*173 GeV.

Bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV. So 2*4.7 = ~9.4 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9.4, so X can't decay into b bbar. Because 6 < 9.4, so that's not allowed.

What about charm quark? Charm is around 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 = 3 GeV. 6 GeV is more than 3, so that's allowed. So c cbar is possible.

Similarly, strange quark is about 100 MeV (0.1 GeV). 2*0.1 = 0.2 GeV. 6 is way more than that. So s sbar allowed.

Up and down quarks are even lighter. Up is about 2 MeV, down about 5 MeV. So 2*(5 MeV) is negligible. X can decay into u ubar, d dbar.

Now for leptons. The tau lepton is about 1.77 GeV. So 2*1.77 = 3.54 GeV. 6 GeV is more than that, so tau pair is allowed.

Similarly, muon is about 0.1 GeV. 2*0.1=0.2. So decay into mu pair is allowed.

Electron is even lighter. 2*0.0005 (approx) = 0.001 GeV. So e+ e- decay is allowed.

So X can decay into any of these, except for b, t, since their masses are too high. But looking at the options, option A includes b and s, but the mass of X is 6 GeV which is less than 2m_b. So A is wrong because it includes b bbar.

Looking at the options, let's check:

Option A: includes b, which is incorrect.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So yes, that's possible.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, but also t. But t is too massive, so C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b as a decay product, which is impossible.

Wait, option B is X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's all the possible pairs except b and t. So option B is correct.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the masses. For X mass=6 GeV.

For c: 1.5 GeV. So 6 > 2*1.5? 3 GeV. So yes, allowed.

s: about 0.1 GeV. 6>0.2 GeV, yes.

u: 0.002 GeV. 6>0.004, yes.

d: 0.005 GeV. 6>0.01, yes.

Tau: 1.77 GeV. So 2*1.77=3.54 GeV. 6>3.54, yes.

Mu: 0.1 GeV. 6>0.2, yes.

E: negligible, so yes.

So all these are allowed. So the correct decay products are the ones in option B.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda_f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (v + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

From the Lagrangian, it is evident that \( X \) interacts with all fermions, as the interaction term is general for fermionic fields \( \psi_f \). The kinematically allowed decays depend on whether the total mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion pair being produced.

### Analysis of Possible Decay Products:
1. **Bottom quark (\( b \bar{b} \)):**  
   The bottom quark mass is approximately \( 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \). The threshold for \( X \to b \bar{b} \) is \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} < 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is not allowed.

2. **Charm quark (\( c \bar{c} \)):**  
   The charm quark mass is approximately \( 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \). The threshold for \( X \to c \bar{c} \) is \( 2m_c \approx 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} > 3 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is allowed.

3. **Strange quark (\( s \bar{s} \)):**  
   The strange quark mass is approximately \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \). The threshold for \( X \to s \bar{s} \) is \( 2m_s \approx 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} > 0.2 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is allowed.

4. **Up quark (\( u \bar{u} \)) and Down quark (\( d \bar{d} \)):**  
   The up and down quark masses are approximately \( 2 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. The thresholds for \( X \to u \bar{u} \) and \( X \to d \bar{d} \) are negligible compared to \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). These decays are allowed.

5. **Tau lepton (\( \tau^+ \tau^- \)):**  
   The tau lepton mass is approximately \( 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \). The threshold for \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \) is \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.54 \, \text{GeV} \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} > 3.54 \, \text{GeV} \), this decay is allowed.

6. **Muon (\( \mu^+ \mu^- \)) and Electron (\( e^+ e^- \)):**  
   The muon and electron masses are approximately \( 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), respectively. The thresholds for \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \) and \( X \to e^+ e^- \) are negligible compared to \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). These decays are allowed.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_X < 2m_b \). Incorrect.  
- **Option B:** Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.  
- **Option C:** Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed due to the extremely high mass of the top quark. Incorrect.  
- **Option D:** Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
