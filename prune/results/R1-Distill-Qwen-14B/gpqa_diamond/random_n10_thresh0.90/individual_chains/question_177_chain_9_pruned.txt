Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question again.

So, there are two stars: Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2. Oh wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature.

The question says that through spectroscopy, the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is given by Wien's Law. So Wien's Law says lambda_max * T = constant, which is about 2.898×10^-3 m·K. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, then their temperatures must be the same? Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So that would imply that both have the same temperature. Because the peak emission for a blackbody is at a wavelength given by Wien's Law. So if lambda_max is the same for both, then T is the same for both.

But wait, wait. Is that the case? Or could the stars have different temperatures but their spectral lines or something else make them appear brightest at the same wavelength? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. The question says through spectroscopy, they determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. Oh, maybe that refers to the Doppler shift? Like, their actual rest wavelengths are different, but due to their velocities, they appear shifted. So the measured wavelength is the observed wavelength, not the rest wavelength.

Wait, that's a possibility. Oh, because the radial velocity is given—Star 1 has 0, Star 2 has 700 km/s. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but the rest wavelengths are different. So that would mean that the actual temperatures are different, but their observed peak wavelengths are the same because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So are we talking about the observed lambda_max (which would factor in their velocities) or the intrinsic lambda_max (which would be based on their temperatures)?

This is a bit confusing. Let me think. The problem says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed brightness maximum is the same wavelength for both. But that could be due to Doppler shifting. So the actual rest frame lambda_max would be different, but because of their velocities, the observed wavelengths are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the peak emission wavelengths are the same, which would imply same temperature, but that ignores the velocity. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let me approach it step by step.

So, the problem says each star's brightness is highest at the same observed wavelength. Let's say the observed wavelength is lambda_observed. But each star may have a different rest wavelength, due to their motion (radial velocity). So perhaps we need to compute their rest wavelengths and then use that to find their temperatures.

Wait, the radial velocities are given: Star 1 has radial velocity zero, so no Doppler shift. Star 2 has 700 km/s. So for Star 2, its observed wavelength is either longer or shorter than its rest wavelength, depending on whether it's moving away or towards us. But the problem says the observed peak wavelengths are the same as that of Star 1.

Wait, but Star 1 has zero velocity, so its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength. So Star 2's observed wavelength is the same as Star 1's. Therefore, Star 2's rest wavelength is different from Star 1's.

So, for Star 1: lambda_1_observed = lambda_1_rest.

For Star 2: lambda_2_observed = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c), assuming it's moving away (v2 is positive when moving away). Wait, but v is given as 700 km/s. I'm not sure if it's moving away or towards. But the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. So Star 1: v1=0, Star 2: v2=700. But without knowing the direction, we can't be sure. Hmm. But perhaps the sign is given, but just the magnitude is given? The problem states radial velocities are 0 and 700, so perhaps 700 km/s is away, so redshifted.

Wait, but the question is about the luminosity, so maybe the exact direction doesn't matter for now. Let me proceed.

So, the observed wavelength for Star 2 is lambda_2_observed = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c), where v2 is positive if moving away.

But lambda_1_observed = lambda_1_rest, and they are the same as lambda_2_observed.

So lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

Wait, but Star 1's observed wavelength is same as Star 2's. So, for Star 1: lambda_1_obs = lambda_1_rest.

Star 2: lambda_2_obs = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But lambda_1_obs = lambda_2_obs.

So, lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c).

But using Wien's Law, lambda_max is proportional to 1/T.

So, lambda_1_rest * T1 = lambda_2_rest * T2 = constant.

Wait, but from lambda_1_rest = lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c), so:

lambda_1_rest / lambda_2_rest = (1 + v2/c).

And from Wien's Law,

lambda_1_rest * T1 = lambda_2_rest * T2.

So substituting lambda_1_rest:

[lambda_2_rest * (1 + v2/c)] * T1 = lambda_2_rest * T2.

The lambda_2_rest terms cancel out, so:

(1 + v2/c) * T1 = T2.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

But wait, wait. Wait, v2 is 700 km/s. Let me compute v2/c.

c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is about 0.002333. So 1 + v2/c is approximately 1.002333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So T2 is roughly 0.23% higher than T1.

Hmm, but this is probably a small effect. So maybe the temperatures are almost the same, but T2 is a bit higher.

But wait, wait a second. If Star 2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer. So the observed maximum is at a longer wavelength than its rest frame. But according to the problem, the observed maximum is same as Star 1's observed maximum. So Star 1's rest wavelength is same as its observed. So Star 1's rest wavelength is same as Star 2's observed. Which is longer than Star 2's rest wavelength if it's moving away.

So, the rest wavelength of Star 2 is shorter than that of Star 1.

So, using Wien's law: lambda_rest = constant / T.

So, if lambda_2_rest is shorter, then T2 is higher than T1.

Which matches with our earlier result: T2 ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

So, temperature difference is small. Now, moving on to luminosity.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So, L1 = 4 pi (R1)^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4 pi (R2)^2 sigma T2^4.

So, the ratio L1/L2 is (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4).

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5.

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1.002333), approximately.

So, T2 ≈ 1.002333 T1.

So, T2^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4 T1^4.

Let me compute (1.002333)^4.

First compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.002329 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x).

So ln(1.002333)^4 ≈ 4 * 0.002329 ≈ 0.009316.

Exponentiate: exp(0.009316) ≈ 1 + 0.009316 + (0.009316)^2/2 ≈ 1.00937.

So, T2^4 ≈ 1.00937 T1^4.

Now, putting it all together:

L1/L2 = ( (1.5)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( (R2)^2 * T2^4 ) )

Wait, R2 is R2, R1 =1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( (R2)^2 * (1.00937 T1^4) ) )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2^2) * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * 1.00937 T1^4 )

R2^2 and T1^4 cancel out.

= 2.25 / 1.00937 ≈ ?

Compute 2.25 / 1.00937.

Let me compute:

1.00937 * 2.22 = approx 2.22 * 1 =
