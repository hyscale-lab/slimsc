Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each step. Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

The problem states that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I probably need to normalize this state because the question mentions it's proportional, not normalized. Wait, right, when a state is given as proportional, that means we need to find the normalization constant.

The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. That's good because when calculating probabilities, I can use the inner products directly.

First step: normalize |alpha>.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So let's compute the inner product.

<alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 because the cross terms would involve inner products of |up> and |down>, which are zero since they're orthogonal.

Wait, |a + b|^2 where a and b are orthogonal? Oh right, because <up|down> is zero. So the squared magnitude is sum of squares of the coefficients.

So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 because the modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b². So (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), which means the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Got it. So the state is normalized now.

Next part of the problem: calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so it's a 2x2 matrix?

Yes, because the problem is about spin-1/2 particles, with up and down states.

So the matrix A would look like:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because for i != j, A_ij is hbar/2, and diagonal is 0.

Hmm. So this operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal.

Wait, I think this operator is actually sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and multiplying by hbar/2 gives the matrix A. So A = (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Right, sigma_x (Pauli X) has eigenstates that are the eigenstates of A.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively.

But since our A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues will be (hbar/2) *1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), so +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the question is, when we measure the operator A, what is the probability of getting each eigenvalue, and what is the average value.

Wait, the question says "each of the eigenstates of the operator" but I think it's referring to the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, so probably the two possible outcomes.

But to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the square of the coefficients gives the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is the expectation value of the projection onto the (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) state.

Alternatively, since the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So to find the probability of measuring +hbar/2, we compute |< +x | alpha >|^2.

Wait, let me proceed step by step.

We have |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Expressed in terms of |up> and |down>, which are the standard basis vectors.

The eigenstates of A (or sigma_x) are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, we can write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |-x>.

Then the coefficients c_+ and c_- are given by inner products.

Let me compute c_+ = < +x | alpha >.

Compute < +x | alpha >.

< +x | = ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2).

So,

c_+ = [ ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Multiplying these together:

c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Wait, because < up | up > is 1, < down | down > is 1. So when you multiply, you get (1+i) *1 + (2-i)*1, since <up|down> and <down|up> are zero.

So numerator is (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

So c_+ = 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) = 3/sqrt(14).

Similarly, the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is |c_+|^2 = (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, but wait: 9/14 is approximately 0.6429. Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 0.64, which is close. But wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recompute c_+.

c_+ is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2)*sqrt(7).

Wait, (1+i) is from < up | (1+i)|up> ?

Wait, no, wait: < +x | alpha > is [ ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ] multiplied by [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

= [ (1+i) < up | up > + (2 -i) < down | up > ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Similarly for the other term.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The inner product is linear, so:

= [ (1+i) < up | up > + (2 -i) < down | up > ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Wait, no, wait, actually:

Wait, no, the correct way is:

< +x | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2)] [ < up | alpha > + < down | alpha > ]

Because < +x | alpha > = ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2) ) multiplied by |alpha>, which is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So,

= [ ( < up | (1+i)|up> + < up | (2 -i)|down> ) + ( < down | (1+i)|up> + < down | (2 -i)|down> ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

But since < up | down > = 0 and < down | up > = 0, this simplifies to:

= [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) * 0 + (1+i)*0 + (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

So numerator is (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

Hence, c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)).

So |c_+|^2 = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, let's compute c_- , which is < -x | alpha >.

< -x | = ( < up | - < down | ) / sqrt(2).

So,

c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)).

Wait, same approach:

c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

= [ (1+i - 2 + i) ] / (sqrt(14) )

= [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14)

So, the magnitude squared is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / 14 = (1 +4)/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.6429, and 5/14 is about 0.3571. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

So that matches the probabilities.

But wait, let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the eigenvalues and the operator. Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2, which are 9/14 and 5/14.

So 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is 0.64 when rounded, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded.

So the first two values in the answer would be 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the average value (expectation value) of operator A.

The expectation value is < alpha | A | alpha >.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, the expectation is real.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and we can compute the expectation value as (hbar/2) < sigma_x >.

But perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

Compute < alpha | A | alpha >.

Given that |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So first, let me write A in matrix form. Since |up> is the first basis state and |down> is the second.

A is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

So A|up> = (hbar/2)|down>, and A|down> = (hbar/2)|up>.

So A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ] / sqrt(7).

Then, < alpha | A | alpha > is the inner product of |alpha> with A|alpha>.

So,

< alpha | A | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7))*( conjugate(1+i) , conjugate(2 -i) ) [hbar/(2 sqrt(7))] ( (2 - i), (1 +i) )^T )

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me compute it step by step.

Compute < alpha | A | alpha >:

= (1/sqrt(7))*(1-i, 2+i) * A * (1/sqrt(7))*(1+i, 2-i)^T.

Wait, A is a matrix, so when you apply it to |alpha>, you get:

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ] / sqrt(7).

So then, <alpha | A | alpha> is the inner product of |alpha> and A|alpha>.

So,

= [ (1-i) < up | + (2 +i) < down | ] * [ (hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ( (2 -i) |up> + (1 +i) |down> ) ]

Wait, let me compute it term by term.

< up | A | alpha > = hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) * (2 -i) < up | down > = 0.

Similarly, < down | A | alpha > = hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) * (1 +i) < down | up > = 0.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

Wait, A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2) ( (2 - i) |up> + (1 +i) |down> ) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, no, actually:

Wait, A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (1+i) A|up> + (2 -i) A|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Since A|up> = (hbar/2)|down>, and A|down> = (hbar/2)|up>.

So,

A|alpha> = (hbar/2) [ (1+i) (hbar/2)|down> + (2 -i) (hbar/2)|up> ] / sqrt(7).

= (hbar^2/(4 sqrt(7))) [ (1+i)|down> + (2 -i)|up> ]

But wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it as a matrix product.

Alternatively, let me write |alpha> as a column vector.

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, A is the matrix [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ].

So, A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) , (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, < alpha | A | alpha > is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

So, (1/sqrt(7))*(1 - i, 2 +i) * [ (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the inner product is:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 - i) , (2 + i) ] * (hbar/(2 sqrt(7))) [ (2 - i), (1 + i) ]^T.

So,

= (hbar/(2 * 7)) [ (1 - i)(2 - i) + (2 + i)(1 + i) ]

Compute each term.

First term: (1 - i)(2 - i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) -i*2 + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i^2.

i^2 is -1, so 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 + i)(1 + i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i = 2 +2i +i + (-1) = (2-1) +3i = 1 +3i.

Now sum the two terms: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) )= 2.

So,

< alpha | A | alpha > = (hbar/(2 *7)) * 2 = hbar/(7).

Ah, so the expectation value is hbar/7.

So, putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are orthonormal eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be computed.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The given state is |α⟩ = (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, compute the norm:

\[
\langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A is given by the matrix:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, with eigenstates:

\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\text{up}\rangle + |\text{down}\rangle), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|\text{up}\rangle - |\text{down}\rangle),
\]

and corresponding eigenvalues:

\[
\lambda_+ = \frac{\hbar}{2}, \quad \lambda_- = -\frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩
To compute the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of A, express |α⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:

\[
|\alpha⟩ = c_+ |+x⟩ + c_- |-x⟩,
\]

where the coefficients are:

\[
c_+ = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \text{up} | + \langle \text{down} | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
c_+ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) + (2-i) \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

Similarly,

\[
c_- = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \langle \text{up} | - \langle \text{down} | \right) \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\text{up}\rangle + (2-i)|\text{down}\rangle \right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
c_- = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left( (1+i) - (2-i) \right) = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:

\[
P_+ = |c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P_- = |c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

### Step 5: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]

Using the matrix representation of A and the normalized state |α⟩, compute:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left( (1-i)(2-i) + (2+i)(1+i) \right) \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2 \cdot 7} \cdot 2 = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is ℏ/7. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
