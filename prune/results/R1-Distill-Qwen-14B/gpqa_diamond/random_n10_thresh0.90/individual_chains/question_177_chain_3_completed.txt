Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and jot down what I know.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radii and masses are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, so I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, the luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says they're black bodies, so that formula should apply. But since both are being treated as black bodies, we can use that.

But the question mentions the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem says that the stars have the same λ where they appear brightest. So, if T1 = T2, then their temperatures are the same. Because λ_max is the same.

So, let's think: since T1 = T2, and R1 is 1.5 R2, what would be the ratio of luminosities?

Using L = 4πR²σT⁴, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1=T2, the T ratio is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor would be approximately 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait! There's another factor: radial velocity. The radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. How does that come into play?

Oh, right! The radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. The star moving towards us (or away) will shift the wavelength. But wait, in the problem, they found that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both, but their actual temperatures may be different because of the Doppler shift.

Ah, now I see. I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming their actual temperatures are the same, but I need to correct for the Doppler effect.

Because the stars are moving, their emitted wavelengths are Doppler shifted. So the observed λ_max is the same, but the actual emitted λ_max would differ based on their velocities.

Wait, so let me think. Let's denote λ_emitted as the wavelength emitted by the star (the λ_max for their own rest frame). The observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_emitted multiplied by a Doppler factor.

The Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much less than c, but using the relativistic approximation might complicate things. Alternatively, if the velocities are non-relativistic, the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v_r / c) is used. But wait, when a star is moving away, the wavelength is redshifted, so λ_obs would be longer.

But wait, Star_1 has v_r = 0, so its λ_obs is equal to λ_emitted,1. Star_2 has v_r = 700 km/s. Let's compute the Doppler shift for Star_2.

So, the observed λ_max for Star_2 would be λ2_obs = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v2_r) / (1 - v2_r) ), but since v2_r is positive, the denominator becomes (1 - v2_r/c), but wait, v2_r is 700 km/s. Let me calculate v2_r in terms of c.

Speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is about 0.002333c. So non-relativistic speeds, so the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r / c) can be used.

Wait, but which direction is the star moving? If Star_2 is moving away from us (since radial velocity is positive, assuming away is positive), then the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted). So, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But according to the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So:

λ1_obs = λ2_obs

But λ1_obs = λ1_emit (since Star_1 has v_r1 = 0) → λ1_emit = λ1_obs.

Similarly, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c).

So setting λ1_obs = λ2_obs → λ1_emit = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2 / c).

But from Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So, λ1_emit = b / T1, and λ2_emit = b / T2.

So substituting:

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2 / c )

So, T1 / T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

Wait, that's opposite. Let me re-derive.

Wait, 1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the sign. If Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted. So the observed λ_max is longer. So λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 + v_r2/c ). Since λ2_emit = b/T2, and λ1_emit = b/T1.

And since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, and λ1_obs = λ1_emit, which is b/T1.

So,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) (1 + v_r2/c )

So,

T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T1 is less than T2? Because denominator is greater than 1.

Wait, but Star_1 has a larger radius and luminosity. Hmm, but let's proceed.

We can express the ratio of T1 to T2 as T1/T2 = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So, let's compute v_r2: 700 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s, so 700/3e5 ≈ 0.0023333.

So (1 + v_r2/c) ≈ 1.0023333.

So,

T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99767.

So T1 is about 0.99767 times T2.

But wait, Star_1 is supposed to have a higher luminosity because of its larger radius, but perhaps lower temperature. So L = 4πR²σT^4.

So now, L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) = (2.25) * ( (T1/T2)^4 )

We know that T1/T2 = 0.99767, as computed before.

So,

( T1 / T2 )^4 ≈ (0.99767)^4 ≈ approximately, let's compute 0.99767^4.

Wait, 0.99767 is about 0.9977. Let me compute (0.9977)^4.

Compute 0.9977^2: 0.9977 * 0.9977.

0.9977 * 0.9977: let's compute 1 * 1 is 1, subtract 0.0023. Wait, no, perhaps better to compute (1 - 0.0023)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0023 + (0.0023)^2 ≈ 0.9954 + 0.00000529 ≈ 0.99540529.

Wait, but 0.9977 is 1 - 0.0023? No, 1 - 0.0023 is 0.9977. So (0.9977)^2 is (1 - 0.0023)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*(0.0023) + (0.0023)^2 ≈ 0.9954 + 0.00000529 ≈ 0.99540529.

Then, (0.9977)^4 is (0.99540529)^2.

Compute 0.99540529^2: (1 - 0.00459471)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00459471 + (0.00459471)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00918942 + 0.0000211 ≈ 0.99083168.

Wait, but wait, 0.99540529 is approximately 0.9954. So 0.9954 squared is:

Let me compute 0.9954 * 0.9954:

9954 * 9954. Let's compute 10,000 - 46 = 9954. So (10,000 - 46)^2 = 100,000,000 - 2*10,000*46 + 46^2 = 1e8 - 920,000 + 2116 = 99,080,2116? Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.9954 * 0.9954.

(1 - 0.0046)^2 = 1 - 2*0.0046 + 0.0046^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0092 + 0.00002116 ≈ 0.99082116.

So, (0.9977)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9908.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9908 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9908.

Compute 2.25 * 0.9908.

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But 0.9908 is 0.99 + 0.0008, so 2.25 * 0.0008 = 0.0018.

So 2.2275 + 0.0018 = 2.2293.

Approximately 2.23.

So, the luminosity of Star_1 is about 2.23 times that of Star_2. Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the Doppler shift part.

Wait, Doppler shift formula can also be approximated as λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c) when v_r << c. So, since Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, and c is 3e5 km/s, 700 is 0.002333 times c, so the approximation is valid.

So, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c )

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 (given in the problem), and λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 (since Star_1 has zero radial velocity), then λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 (1 + v_r2/c )

From Wien's law, λ_emit = b / T, so λ_emit1 = b / T1 and λ_emit2 = b / T2. So,

b/(T1) = (b/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v_r2/c )

Which gives T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c )

So, T1 = T2 * [1 / (1 + 700/(3e5)) ].

Compute 700/(3e5) = 700/300000 = 0.00233333.

So 1 + 0.00233333 = 1.0023333.

Thus, T1 = T2 * (1/1.0023333) ≈ T2 * 0.99767.

So, T1 is approximately 99.767% of T2.

So, the temperature ratio is T1/T2 ≈ 0.99767.

So, when we compute (T1/T2)^4, that would be (0.99767)^4.

Wait, earlier I calculated that as approximately 0.9908. Let's recompute:

0.99767^2 = (approx) 0.99767 * 0.99767.

Compute 99767 * 99767. Alternatively, compute 0.99767^2.

Compute 1 - 2*(0.00233) + (0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00466 + 0.0000054 ≈ 0.9953454.

Then, 0.9953454 squared:

Again, 0.9953454^2 = (1 - 0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046546 + (0.0046546)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093092 + 0.00002167 ≈ 0.99071247.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9907.

So, L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (0.9907) = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ ?

2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275, and 2.25 * 0.0007 is 0.001575. So total is approximately 2.229075, which is about 2.229. So, approximately 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

So, the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the formula for luminosity of a black body:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
The problem states that \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \). Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The stars are observed to have the same wavelength at which they appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)). Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the observed wavelength is related to the emitted wavelength by the Doppler effect. For Star_2, moving with a radial velocity \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is redshifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} = \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}}
\]

For non-relativistic speeds (\( v_r \ll c \)), this simplifies to:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \approx \lambda_{\text{max, emit}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \) is the same for both stars, we equate the emitted wavelengths:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit, 1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit, 2}} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Using Wien's Law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} = \frac{b}{T} \)):

\[
\frac{b}{T_1} = \frac{b}{T_2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Canceling \( b \) and solving for \( T_1/T_2 \):

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

Substituting \( v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \):

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{300000} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.002333} \approx \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Luminosity Ratio
Substituting \( R_1/R_2 = 1.5 \) and \( T_1/T_2 \approx 0.99767 \) into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 \):

\[
(1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

Next, calculate \( (0.99767)^4 \). Using the approximation \( (1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x \) for small \( x \):

\[
(0.99767)^4 \approx 1 - 4(0.00233) = 1 - 0.00932 = 0.99068
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.99068 \approx 2.229
\]

### Final Answer
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately \( 2.23 \) times that of Star_2. Comparing this result with the options provided, the closest match is:

**D) ~2.23**
