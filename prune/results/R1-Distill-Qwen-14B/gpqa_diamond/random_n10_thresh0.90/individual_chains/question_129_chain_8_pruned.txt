Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. Hmm, I'll need to work through each step carefully.

First, let's write down the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints given.

Looking at the hints:

a) Compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. 

Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with a carbonyl group. So, compound A must have a carbonyl group since it's reacting with a ylide. The product is a cyclopentane with substituents. Let me think about the structure.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is the group CH2-C(CH3)=. So, when attached to the cyclopentane, it would form a double bond from the ring to the substituent.

So, the product is a cyclopentane where carbons 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and carbon 4 has a substituent which is a group like CH2-C(CH3)=. Wait, but the product is the result of a Wittig reaction, so the starting material for that would be an aldehyde or ketone.

Wait, actually, the Wittig reagent (ylide) would attack the carbonyl group of compound A. So compound A must have a carbonyl group. The product of the Wittig reaction would have a new double bond, formed by the ylide's R groups (in this case, the propan-2-ylidene group) and the carbonyl's R group.

So, if the ylide is Ph3P=CH2-C(CH3)-, wait, no. Wait, the propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)C(CH3)=, so the ylide would be something like Ph3P+=CH-C(CH3)2? Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph3P+=C(CH2CH(CH3)2). No, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think differently. The product after the Wittig reaction is the alkene. So, the starting material (compound A) must have a carbonyl group adjacent to a point where the ylide adds.

So, when the ylide adds to the carbonyl, it forms a four-membered ring (oxaphosphetane) which then breaks down to form the alkene and phosphine oxide.

In the product, the substituent is the propan-2-ylidene group, which suggests that the ylide was from a propan-2-ol (like CH3CH(OH)CH2?), but wait, the ylide would have the structure Ph3P+=CH-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, maybe the ylide is Ph3P+=CH-C(CH3)2. So, when this reacts with compound A's carbonyl, it forms a double bond. So, the structure after the Wittig would be a cyclopentane with a double bond connected to a CH(CH3)2 group.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. The substituent at 4 is propan-2-ylidene, which is a substituent with a double bond. Wait, but the ylide adds to the carbonyl, so in
