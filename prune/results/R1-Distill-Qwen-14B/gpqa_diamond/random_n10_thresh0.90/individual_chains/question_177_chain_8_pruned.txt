Okay, I need to figure out how much more luminous Star_1 is compared to Star_2. Both are black bodies, so I should use the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The law says that luminosity L is proportional to R² times T⁴, right? So L = 4πσR²T⁴, but since we're comparing two stars, the constants will cancel out, so L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

The problem states that Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. I'll plug that into the equation. So R1² is (1.5)^2 R2² = 2.25 R2². So the R part is 2.25 times R2 squared, but since we're taking the ratio, it'll be (R1²/R2²) = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25. So the R part is 2.25.

Now the tricky part is the temperatures. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1 = λ2, so T1 = T2. Wait, that can't be right because if their temperatures are the same, then the luminosity ratio is just (R1²/R2²) = 2.25. But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the correct one because the answer options have 2.23, 2.25, 2.32, etc. But wait, some of the options are around 2.25. Option A is 2.25, D is 2.23. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. How does that affect anything? Oh, right, because the observed wavelength (like Doppler shift) would change. But wait, the question says they measured the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. Oh, maybe I should consider the Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths, and then compute the actual temperature from that.

So let's break it down. The observed wavelength λ_obs is due to the Doppler effect. The formula for Doppler shift is λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, if v_r is the radial velocity towards us, then if v_r is positive when moving away, and negative when moving towards. But wait, the exact formula can be a bit tricky. Alternatively, for small velocities compared to c, the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c). But wait, if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then its observed λ would be longer (redshifted), whereas Star_1's λ is the same as its emitted λ because v_r is zero.

Wait, but the question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for Star_1 is λ1, and for Star_2 it's λ2. But these are the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. 

But Star_1 has v_r = 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its emitted λ_max. For Star_2, which has v_r = 700 km/s (I think positive implies moving away), so its observed λ_max' is longer than emitted λ_max''.

Wait, let me clarify. The emitted λ_max (λ_emitted) is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T. So if Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ_max would be λ_emitted * (1 + v_r/c) approximately, assuming v_r << c.

So in the problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

But for Star_1, λ1_obs is equal to λ1_emitted, because its radial velocity is zero. For Star_2, λ2_obs =
