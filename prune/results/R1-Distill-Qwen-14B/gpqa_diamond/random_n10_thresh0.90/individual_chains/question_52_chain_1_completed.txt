--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless versus when it's spotted.

Hmm, so the key here is the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E1 and E2 are the energies, and k is Boltzmann's constant. 

Wait, so the ratio depends exponentially on the temperature. If the temperature changes, this ratio changes as well. But why does the ratio decrease when the star has spots? Spots make the overall Teff lower. Let's think about what happens when the temperature decreases.

In the Boltzmann equation, if the temperature T goes down, the exponent -(ΔE)/(k*T) becomes more negative, because T is in the denominator. So the exponential term would get smaller. Wait, but the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, meaning exp becomes smaller. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease if the denominator (n2) is in the denominator, I might be getting confused here.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The ratio is n1/n2. When T decreases, the exponent -ΔE/(kT) becomes more negative. So the exponential term is exp(negative number) which is a small number, but if the exponent is more negative, the exponential becomes even smaller. So n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) multiplied by a smaller number. So if the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing, that implies that n1 is getting smaller relative to n2, or n2 is getting larger relative to n1.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the Teff is lower (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 is lower than when Teff is 6000 K.

So let me think about that. When Teff drops, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So we can model it as:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, because E2 is higher than E1 if the transition is from level 1 to level 2. So E2 > E1. So (E2-E1) is positive. So the exponent is positive. So as T decreases, the exponent becomes larger because dividing the same positive number by a smaller T (since T is in the denominator) makes the exponent more positive. Wait, no. Let me see: for T1 = 6000 K and T2 = 5500 K.

Wait, wait, the exponent is -(E2 - E1)/(k T) = -ΔE/(k T), assuming E2 > E1, so ΔE is positive. So the exponent is negative. So when T decreases, the value of the exponent becomes more negative. So the exponential term, exp(negative), becomes smaller because the exponent's magnitude increases.

So n1/n2 is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So as T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. Which is what the problem states: when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So that makes sense.

We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes. So we're looking for (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But let's think about the temperatures. The star without spots has Teff = 6000 K, and with spots, Teff = 5500 K. But wait, wait, wait! Are these the effective temperatures of the entire star, or is the Teff the same across the photosphere?

Wait, the problem says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because effective temperature is an average, right? So perhaps the star's surface has regions at different temperatures. But for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is covered.

Wait, but the question says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti atoms, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the relevant temperature is the local temperature of the photosphere in the regions being considered.

Wait, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so each region is in local thermal equilibrium. But when the star is spotted, some regions (the spots) are cooler, and the rest are at the original temperature.

But for each region, the ratio depends on the local temperature. So the observed overall ratio would be a weighted average of the ratios from the different regions. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and treating the entire photosphere as being at the average effective temperature. But I don't think that's correct because the ratio would depend on the local temperature in each region. But the problem doesn't give any details about the temperature of the spots. It just says that the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% of the surface is covered.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So for the purpose of the ratio, we can model it as the stars being at 5500 K when spotted, and 6000 K otherwise.

Wait, but let's read the question again carefully. The problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere, on average, is at 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K.

Wait, but that can't be right because spots are cooler regions. So the overall effective temperature is lower. So the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. But if the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in the photosphere as a whole, then we might need to model it as a sum of contributions from the different regions.

Wait, but the question says "in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels", so perhaps it's considering the photosphere as a combination of regions with and without spots. So when 40% of the surface is spots, 40% is cooler (spots have lower temperature) and 60% is at 6000 K. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the temperature of the spots. It just says that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present. But that doesn't make much sense because the spots are cooler.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when the spots are present. So the photosphere's effective temperature is lower, so the effective temperature we should consider for the Boltzmann factor is 5500 K.

But wait, the problem states that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. 1448 Angstroms is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. Let me check: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1448 A is 144.8 nm, which is in the UV. 

The energy difference ΔE between the two levels can be found using the wavelength. The formula is ΔE = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light.

So let me calculate ΔE. Let's get the numbers right.

h = 6.626e-34 J s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448 A = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) 

Let me compute that:

(6.626e-34 * 3e8) = 1.9878e-25 J m
Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

But wait, 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 J. So converting J to eV:

ΔE = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 1448 A is about 145 nm. Let me compute hc/λ in eV.

hc = 12400 eV·Å (since 1240 eV·nm, and 1 nm is 10 Å, so 12400 eV·Å).

So hc/λ = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV. Yes, that's correct.

So ΔE is about 8.56 eV.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, the energy difference is expressed in terms of k*T. So I need to compute (ΔE)/(k*T) for both temperatures.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So for T = 6000 K:

(ΔE)/(k T) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) 

Let me compute that denominator: 8.617e-5 * 6000 = 0.517 eV.

So 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.56.

Similarly, for T = 5500 K:

(8.56) / (8.617e-5 *5500) = 8.56 / (0.4739) ≈ 18.07.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, let me compute 8.617e-5 * 5500:

8.617e-5 *5500 = 8.617 *55 * 1e-3. Wait, 8.617 *55 is approximately 474, so 474e-3 = 0.474 eV.

So 8.56 / 0.474 ≈ 18.07.

Wait, that's a much larger value. But wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. The denominator is (k*T), which is in eV, and the numerator is in eV, so the ratio is dimensionless.

So for T=6000 K: 8.56 / (8.617e-5 * 6000) = 8.56 / (0.51702) ≈ 16.556.

And for T=5500 K: 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500) = 8.56 / (0.473935) ≈ 18.07.

Wait, that's correct. So the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is (ΔE)/(k T), which is about 16.556 at 6000 K and 18.07 at 5500 K.

Wait, but wait a second. The exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T) = ΔE/(k T). But in the Boltzmann factor, it's exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So the ratio (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Since ΔE is positive, the exponent is negative.

So for T=6000 K, expterm = exp(-16.556), and for T=5500 K, it's exp(-18.07).

Wait, but those are extremely small numbers. Let's compute them.

exp(-16.556): Approximately, since exp(-10)≈4.5e-5, exp(-16)= approx 8.6e-8. 16.556 is a bit more than 16, so exp(-16.556) ≈ 8.6e-8 * exp(-0.556). exp(-0.556) ≈ 0.571. So 8.6e-8 * 0.571 ≈ 4.9e-8.

Similarly, exp(-18.07): let's see. exp(-18)=approx 1.5e-8. 18.07 is 0.07 more than 18. So exp(-0.07) is about 0.932. So exp(-18.07)=1.5e-8 * 0.932 ≈ 1.4e-8.

Wait, so for T=6000 K, the ratio is (g1/g2) * 4.9e-8.

For T=5500 K, it's (g1/g2)*1.4e-8.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio with spots (at 5500 K) is smaller than without spots (at 6000 K). Let's compute the ratio of the two ratios.

The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [ (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*6000)) ] / [ (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ].

The (g1/g2) terms cancel out, leaving exp( [ΔE/(k*6000) - ΔE/(k*5500)] ) ).

Wait, wait, that's because when you divide exponents, you subtract. So let me compute the exponents.

So the exponent is [ (ΔE/(k*6000)) - (ΔE/(k*5500)) ) ].

Which is ΔE/k * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818.

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (0.000181818 - 0.000166667) = 0.000015151.

Wait, but wait, wait: 1/6000 is 1.66667e-4, 1/5500 is 1.81818e-4.

So 1.66667e-4 - 1.81818e-4 = -1.5151e-5.

Wait, because 1/6000 is less than 1/5500. So 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative.

So the exponent becomes (ΔE/k) * ( -1.5151e-5 )

So we have exp( (ΔE/k) * (-1.5151e-5) )

Which is exp( - (ΔE/k) * 1.5151e-5 )

Let me compute (ΔE/k) * 1.5151e-5.

Earlier, I found ΔE/(k*T) for T=6000 K was about 16.556.

Wait, but wait, let me compute ΔE/k.

We have ΔE=8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/k = 8.56 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617.

Let me compute that:

8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 8.56 * 11600 ≈ 99,400 K.

Wait, no:

Wait, 0.00008617 is 8.617e-5. So 8.56 / 8.617e-5 = 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99,300 K.

So ΔE/k ≈ 99,300 K.

So now, (ΔE/k) * 1.5151e-5 = 99300 * 1.5151e-5 = 99300 * 0.000015151 ≈ 1.504.

So the exponent is -1.504.

So the factor is exp( -1.504 ) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but wait, that's the factor of (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = 0.221. So the ratio without spots is 0.221 times the ratio with spots. Or in other words, the ratio with spots is larger than the ratio without spots. But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Which would imply that the star with spots has a lower ratio, so (n1/n2)_with_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

Wait, but according to our calculation, (n1/n2)_no_spots is 0.221 times (n1/n2)_with_spots. So (n1/n2)_no_spots = 0.221 * (n1/n2)_with_spots. That would mean that (n1/n2)_no_spots is smaller than (n1/n2)_with_spots, which contradicts the problem statement. Because the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2)_with_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_no_spots.

Wait, I must have made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let's re-examine.

Wait, the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = exp( [ (ΔE/(k*6000) ) - (ΔE/(k*5500)) ] )

Wait, no, wait: the ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So the ratio when no spots is (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) )

The ratio when spots is (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) )

So the factor is [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

The (g1/g2) cancels out, giving exp( ( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) + (ΔE/(k*5500) ) )

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) ( 1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ) )

Because ( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) + (ΔE/(k*5500) ) = ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ]

Wait, that's the same as ΔE/(k) [ (6000 -5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) ]

Hmm, but let's compute 1/5500 - 1/6000 = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) )= 500 / (33,000,000) )= 5e2 / 3.3e7 = 5/(33000) ≈ 0.0001515.

Wait, so the exponent is (ΔE/k) * 0.0001515.

Earlier, we found that (ΔE/k)= approximately 99,300 K.

So 99,300 K * 0.0001515 ≈ 15.06.

So the exponent is 15.06, so exp(15.06) is a very large number.

Wait, but exp(15.06) is on the order of millions. Let me compute it:

exp(15) is approximately 3.269 million.

exp(15.06) is about 3.269e6 * exp(0.06) ≈ 3.269e6 * 1.0618 ≈ 3.472e6.

So the factor is roughly 3.47 million.

But that doesn't make any sense because the problem gives options that are in the single digits. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the exponents. Let me go back to the beginning.

The original ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

When the star has spots, the Teff is lower, so T is 5500 K.

Wait, when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exp term increases, making the ratio (n1/n2) larger.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Which would mean that (n1/n2)_with_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k*5500) ) ]

Which is exp( [ -ΔE/(k*6000) + ΔE/(k*5500) ] )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/5500 - 1/6000 ] )

As before.

We have ΔE/(k) ≈ 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 99,300 K.

So 99300 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) = 99300 * ( (6000 -5500) / (5500*6000) ) )

= 99300 * (500) / (33,000,000 )

= (99300 *500 ) / 3.3e7

= (49,650,000) / 3.3e7 ≈ 1.5045.

So the exponent is 1.5045. So exp(1.5045) ≈ 4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Which is option C.

So the ratio without spots is 4.5 times higher than when spots are present. Therefore, the factor by which the ratio changes is approx 4.5. So the answer is C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from having no spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \)):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Ratio of Ratios:**  
   The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{6000}}{\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)_{5500}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_{6000}}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_{5500}}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{5500}} - \frac{1}{T_{6000}}\right)\right).
   \]

3. **Compute \( \Delta E / k \):**  
   Using \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \):  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99,300 \, \text{K}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \frac{1}{T_{5500}} - \frac{1}{T_{6000}} \):**  
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_{5500}} - \frac{1}{T_{6000}} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33,000,000} \approx 0.0001515.
   \]

5. **Final Exponent and Factor:**  
   Substituting into the exponent:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{5500}} - \frac{1}{T_{6000}}\right) = 99,300 \times 0.0001515 \approx 15.06.
   \]  
   The factor is then:  
   \[
   \exp(15.06) \approx 3.47 \times 10^6.
   \]  
   However, this result is inconsistent with the problem's scale. Re-evaluating the Boltzmann factor for the given temperatures, the correct factor is approximately \( 4.5 \).

### Conclusion:
The ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots, and the factor by which this ratio changes is approximately **4.5**.

Answer: C
