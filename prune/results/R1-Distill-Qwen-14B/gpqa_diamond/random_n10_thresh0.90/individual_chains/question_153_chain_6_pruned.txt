Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to the formation of an enolate. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to find the products for each. Then, I have to match them with the given options to choose the correct answer.

Let's take them one by one.

First reaction:
Reactants: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

I think this is a classic example of the Michael addition. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester, so it can act as a donor in conjugate additions.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. But wait, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-... No, wait, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOO-? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. No, wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO2Me. Because 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would mean the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3, but that doesn't fit because acrylate is typically CH2=CHCOOR.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)O-Me, but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, no, that would make it a propenoate, not acrylate. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl something? Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the structure is (E)-CH2-CH-(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? Or perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, acrylate is usually CH2=CHCOO-; so the '3-' in 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be the carbonyl carbon? No, that can't be because the carbonyl is at the end. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the structure again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH2-p-t
