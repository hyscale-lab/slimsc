Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm. Let me try to break this down.

Alright, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are already detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, both have the same mass? Oh, right. So mass is the same for both. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, so Planet_1 is closer to its star, I guess, since shorter period means it's orbiting faster, probably closer.

Both have circular orbits. That might simplify things because if the orbit is circular, the probability calculations might be easier. No eccentricity messing things up here.

Now, the host stars. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. So Planet_1's star is more massive but same size. Wait, more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe they're in a different evolutionary stage. Oh, the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so perhaps it's a bit older, leading to same radii but different masses. Not sure if that matters for the transit probability.

So the question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. The formula for the probability is something like (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, wait. Let me think. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star and the distance of the planet from the star. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the transit probability (P) is estimated as (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, sometimes it's approximated as R_star / a. But wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits its star is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a. But since planets are much smaller than stars, R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So the transit probability is roughly proportional to R_star / a.

Wait, but another factor is the inclination of the orbit. Oh, right, only edge-on orbits result in transits. The probability for an edge-on orbit is 1/(tilt), but I think that in the general case, the probability is based on the ratio of the size of the star to the semi-major axis, times the probability of the orbital plane being aligned, which is a 1/(a factor). Hmm, maybe I should get that right.

Wait, let me recall. The probability that a randomly oriented orbit transits is given by the formula (R_star / a) multiplied by (something else?), or is it (R_star / a) squared? No, wait, no. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth (or the observer's perspective) relative to the orbit's area. Wait, no, that's the area ratio for the probability, but I'm a bit confused.

Another approach: the transit probability P is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a * sqrt(1-e²)), assuming circular orbits, e is 0, so it's (R_star + R_planet)/a. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the approximation is P ≈ R_star / a.

So R_star is the radius of the star, a is the semi-major axis (distance) of the planet from the star.

But wait, in this problem, both planets are around stars with the same radius. The host stars have the same radii. So R_star_1 = R_star_2.

So the transit probability for each planet would be proportional to 1/a, because P = R_star / a. So the planet with a smaller a (semi-major axis) would have a higher probability.

Wait, no, wait: if a is smaller, R_star is same, then P is higher. So Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, which implies a smaller a (because for a star, the period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³/(M_star), where M_star is the mass of the host star.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (P^2) * (M_star + m_planet) = (4π²/G) * a^3. But since the planet's mass is negligible, P² ≈ a³ / M_star. So a³ ≈ G*M_star * P² / (4π²). So a is proportional to (M_star * P²)^(1/3).

So, a_1 = ( (M_1) * P_1² )^(1/3 )
a_2 = ( (M_2) * P_2² )^(1/3 )

Given that M_1 = 2 * M_2, and P_1 = P_2 /3.

So let's compute a_1 and a_2.

Let me plug in numbers. Let me assign M_2 = M, so M_1 = 2M.

P_1 = P_2 /3.

So a_1 = (2M * (P_2/3)^2 )^(1/3)
= [ 2M * P_2² /9 ]^(1/3)
= (2/9 * M P_2² )^(1/3)

a_2 = [ M * P_2² ]^(1/3 )

So the ratio a_1 / a_2 is [ (2/9) / 1 ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3 ) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 is about 0.606 times a_2. Wait, no, wait: a_1 is smaller than a_2? Because Planet_1 has a shorter period and a more massive star. Let me think about the formula again. Since a is proportional to (M * P²)^(1/3), for Planet_1, M is twice as much, P is 1/3 of Planet_2's period.

So a_1 = [ (2M) * (P_2/3)^2 ]^(1/3 ) = [ 2 M P_2² /9 ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) * [M P_2²]^(1/3 )

Which is (2/9)^(1/3) times a_2, since a_2 is [ M P_2² ]^(1/3 )

So a_1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a_2. Let's compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2/9 is about 0.222, cube root of that is approximately 0.606. So a_1 ≈ 0.606 * a_2.

So a_1 is about 0.606 times a_2. So the semi-major axis of Planet_1 is smaller than that of Planet_2.

Since the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a, and R_star is the same for both, then P_1 / P_2 = (R_star/a_1) / (R_star/a_2) ) = a_2 / a_1.

Because P_1 = R_star / a_1, P_2 = R_star / a_2.

So P_1 / P_2 = a_2 / a_1 = 1 / (a_1/a_2) ) = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So the researchers should observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability to transit.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which I don't think is the case.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \), where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_{\text{star,1}} = R_{\text{star,2}} \)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2 \), we calculate the semi-major axes of the two planets:

- For Planet_1: \( a_1 \propto (M_1 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3} = \left(2M \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9} \cdot M \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3} \).
- For Planet_2: \( a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3} = \left(M \cdot P_2^2\right)^{1/3} \).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis and is closer to its host star.

The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{R_{\text{star}} / a_1}{R_{\text{star}} / a_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Based on this analysis, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
