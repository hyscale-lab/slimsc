Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a possible relative speed and total energy.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for the total energy, each astronaut would have their own relativistic energy, and I'll need to sum them up.

Let me think. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, no, no, wait—actually, if astronaut A is moving at u and astronaut B at v in the same direction, from A's frame, B's speed would be (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Or is it the other way around? Hmm, because if A is moving faster than B, then from A's perspective, B should be moving backward, but since both are in the same direction, maybe the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of frames. Let me clarify.

Actually, the correct formula for the relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the second object from the first's frame. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this right. If I have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative speed as seen from the first object (moving at u) is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So for example, if u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c, then the relative speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (-0.1c)/(1 - (0.3 c²)/c²) → (-0.1c)/(0.7) → approximately -0.1428c. Since speed is positive, it's 0.1428c. But wait, the sign indicates direction. Since v (0.5c) is less than u (0.6c), from u's frame, the other is moving in the negative direction, but the question is about the relative speed, which is a magnitude, so it's 0.1428c. Hmm, so the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c for v_rel.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's total energy is given by gamma times mc². But wait, their rest masses are 2m and 3m. So the energies would be gamma_1 * (2m)c² and gamma_2 * (3m)c².

Calculating gamma for each:

For the first astronaut (u = 0.6c):
gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no: wait, gamma * (mass) * c². So for astronaut 1, mass is 2m, so energy is gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2 (v = 0.5c):
gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1 / 0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So energy2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c², approximately 5.96 m c². 

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², which is lower than our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the relative speed. Let me redo it. The problem says the astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction, so the first is at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the first's frame, what is the speed of the second.

Using the formula: (v' - u)/(1 - (v' u)/c²), where u is the speed of the first (0.6c), and v' is the speed of the second (0.5c) in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for relative velocity when the second is moving at v in lab frame, and the first at u in lab frame (both same direction), then from u's frame, the second's speed is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So substituting the values:

v = 0.5c, u = 0.6c.

(v - u) = -0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So relative velocity is (-0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ -0.14286c. The magnitude is 0.14286c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that matches with option C and D.

So the relative speed is 0.14c.

Wait, but option D says 0.14c, but the energy is 5 mc². Hmm, our calculation was about 5.96 mc², which would make option C the correct one.

So putting it together, the correct answer is option C: v_rel = 0.14c, E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.14286c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the relative speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### Energy of the First Astronaut
The first astronaut has mass \( 2m \) and speed \( u = 0.6c \). Calculating \( \gamma_1 \):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

The energy of the first astronaut is:

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m)c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the Second Astronaut
The second astronaut has mass \( 3m \) and speed \( v = 0.5c \). Calculating \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

The energy of the second astronaut is:

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m)c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of the two astronauts:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
