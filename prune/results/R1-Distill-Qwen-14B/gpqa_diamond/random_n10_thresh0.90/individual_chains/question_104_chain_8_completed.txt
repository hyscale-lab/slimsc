Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. The method used is the radial velocity (RV) method, which detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble.

So, the key data here is the shift in the spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 compared to planet #1?

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p^3) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) / (P * (1 day in seconds)) )

But wait, in this case, the planets' masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like stars). So M_p is negligible compared to M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Alternatively, I think the formula for K is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

But since e is zero (the orbits are circular), and M_p << M_*, the equation simplifies. Let's see, I think another formula connects the velocity semi-amplitude with the orbital period and the mass of the planet. Oh wait, perhaps the RV method's semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * (P/(1 day)) )^(-1/3) * sin i. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relationship between the velocity shift and other planetary parameters. The RV method measures the star's velocity change, which depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit, and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, and assuming the inclinations are the same (since we detected the planet, sin i is probably close to 1 for both), the ratio of their velocity amplitudes should relate to some function of their orbital periods.

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) * (P)^(−1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (P)^(−1/3)

And since both stars have the same mass, and the planets' masses are similar (so M_p is the same as well), and assuming sin i is the same (since both are detected via RV, which depends on sin i, but if they were not edge-on, we might not detect them. So perhaps sin i is about the same for both, let's say sin i ≈ 1 for simplicity), then K is proportional to (1 / (M_*^(2/3))) * (P^(-1/3)).

Wait, but M_* is same for both stars, so K is proportional to P^(-1/3). Because M_* cancels out when taking the ratio. So if K1 is for planet 1, and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let's think again.

From the formula, K ∝ P^(-1/3). So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1 < K2.

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then lower K implies a longer period. Because if P increases, K decreases.

Wait, let me get this right. Let's say P doubles. Then K would be (2)^(−1/3) times the original, which is about 0.7937 times. So K decreases as P increases.

So in our case, K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So K2 > K1, meaning that P2 < P1. Because K is inversely related to P^(1/3). So higher K means smaller P.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If K is proportional to (P)^(-1/3), then:

K = constant * P^(-1/3)

So, solving for P:

P = (constant / K)^3

So when K increases, P decreases.

So, for planet 1, K1 =5, for planet 2, K2=7.

So, P1 is proportional to (1/K1)^3, P2 proportional to (1/K2)^3.

So the ratio P2/P1 = ( (1/K2)^3 ) / ( (1/K1)^3 ) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's compute that:

P2/P1 = ( (1/7) / (1/5) )^3 = (5/7)^3 = (approx) (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait wait, that can't be right. Because if K2 is larger, then P2 is smaller. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So the ratio is P2/P1 = 0.364, which is about 0.36 times. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36, meaning that P1 is longer than P2 by about 2.77 times. Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the question says: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

Oh wait, that's P2/P1. If P2 is smaller, then the ratio is less than 1, so P2 is shorter than P1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times. So the longer period is planet #1.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning. Because in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) )^(1/3) ) / ( ( (M_*)^(2/3) * c ) ) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the factors.

Another approach: The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( ( 2π ) / P )^(1/3) ) / ( c )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / c )

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct formula.

The correct formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G * P) / (2π c³) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) )

But I'm not entirely confident, maybe it's better to recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3))

Wait, I think the formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)² ) )^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) / c

But since M_p is much less than M_*, (M_* + M_p) ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (2π / P )^(1/3) / c

Simplifying, K is proportional to (M_p / M_*² )^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3) ) * (G^(1/3) * 2π^(1/3) ) / c

But since both planets have similar M_p and M_* is same, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3). So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so K1 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) * K2

Wait, let me think again. If K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3), then K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant that depends on other factors.

So, for two planets, K1 = C1 / P1^(1/3), K2 = C2 / P2^(1/3)

But if the C's are the same (since M_p and M_* are same for both), then K1/K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We have K1 =5, K2=7. So 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Taking both sides to the power of 3: (5/7)^3 = P2/P1

Calculating 5/7 is approximately 0.7143. Cubing that gives approximately 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the ratio is less than 1, approximately 0.36.

Looking back at the options, option A is ~0.36, which would be the correct answer.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of this shift, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the orbital period \( P \) raised to the power of \( -1/3 \), assuming the planet's mass \( M_p \) is much smaller than the star's mass \( M_* \), and the orbits are circular (\( e = 0 \)).

The relationship between \( K \) and \( P \) can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

For two planets, \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \), with orbital periods \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is given by:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for the ratio of orbital periods:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.7143 \), and cubing this value:

\[
\left(0.7143\right)^3 \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.36 \) times the orbital period of planet #1. This means planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1.

From the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**
