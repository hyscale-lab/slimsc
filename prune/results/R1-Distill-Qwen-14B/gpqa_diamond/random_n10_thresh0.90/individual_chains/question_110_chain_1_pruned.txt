Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. The question mentions ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the key points from the question. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, that's V < 17, right? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, higher magnitude means dimmer. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag in V, that means it's V <17. Because the scale is inverted. So ESPRESSO can detect stars with V up to 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The question says, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Oh, wait, no. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, then its magnitude is less than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, apparent V magnitude must be ≤17, but wait the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Hmm, no, wait. If a star has an apparent V magnitude of 16, that's brighter than 17. So yes, ESPRESSO can observe it. So the maximum magnitude ESPRESSO can see is up to 17 mag. So any star with V ≤17 can be seen.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag. So same logic, HIRES can see up to V=16 mag. Because anything brighter than 16 is V <16.

So the question is asking which stars are detectable by both. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the apparent V mag must be ≤16. Because if a star's apparent magnitude is 17, HIRES can't see it (since it can only go up to 16). So both spectrographs can only detect stars with V ≤16.

Wait, wait. Let me rephrase: For a star to be detected by both, it must be within the capabilities of both instruments. So for ESPRESSO, the star's V must be ≤17. For HIRES, V must be ≤16. So the stricter condition is V ≤16, so only stars with V ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at each star's data.

Let's go through each star
