Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things are a bit different from classical mechanics. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I think I need to find two things: the relative speed of one astronaut with respect to the other and the total energy of the system.

Wait, right, when dealing with relative speeds at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the velocities like you would in classical mechanics. I remember there's a formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Since both are moving in the same direction, I think I should subtract the slower one from the faster one.

So let's compute that. The first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, the second's is 0.5c. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. Plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Simplifying numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1-0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that narrows it down to options C and D since their relative speed is 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Since both astronauts are moving, I need to calculate their relativistic energies and sum them up. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let's calculate each astronaut's energy.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 -0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc^2, and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct E is about 5.96, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For the first astronaut: 0.6c, gamma is 1.25, correct. 2m * 1.25=2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: 0.5c. (0.5)^2 = 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=approx 0.8660. So gamma = 1/0.8660 ≈1.1547. So 3m *1.1547=3.464 m. So sum is 2.5 +3.464=5.964, yeah, that's correct. So the total energy is about 5.96 mc².

So the options are C and D for the relative speed. From earlier, relative speed is about 0.14c. So option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Option D has a lower energy but same speed.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving at relativistic speeds in the same direction is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96mc^2\)**
