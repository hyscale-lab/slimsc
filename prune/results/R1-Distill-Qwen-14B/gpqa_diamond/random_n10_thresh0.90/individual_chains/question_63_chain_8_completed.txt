--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Hmm, the molecule consists of two atoms, X and Y. The given masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the options are all momentum values in N*s. So I'm looking to calculate the momentum p of the photon that would cause a transition between energy states.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized and involve both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the problem says "next state with the lowest possible energy." I think that refers to the next state when you make a transition, considering both rotational and vibrational changes. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state, which is the ground state. So the molecule is in the ground state, and we need to find the photon that causes it to transition to the next possible state with the lowest energy. So that would likely be the next vibrational state or perhaps a rotational change within the same vibrational state.

Wait, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy." So I think the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either a change in vibrational state or a change in rotational state. But I need to figure out which has a lower energy transition.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the vibrational transition because the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model. Or perhaps it's a purely vibrational transition, not involving rotation.

Wait, but in the non-rigid rotor model, the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, meaning that the bond length can change, which affects the moment of inertia. So the energy levels would account for both rotation and vibration.

But the fundamental state would be the lowest possible vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (j=0). To go to the next state, perhaps it's the first vibrational excited state (v=1) with j=0, or the next rotational state (j=1) with v=0. Which one requires a lower energy photon?

Wait, but the problem is about the momentum of the photon, so I need to find the energy of the photon. The energy of the photon (E_photon) would be equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.

But wait, the initial state is the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy. The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. To find which transition requires less energy, I should compute the energy differences for both possibilities.

Let me compute the vibrational energy difference first. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_v = (v + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h w. So E_photon_vibrational = h w.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_j = B (j(j+1)), where B is the rotational constant, which is (ħ²)/(2I), with I being the moment of inertia. The moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

So for the rotational transition from j=0 to j=1, the energy difference would be E_photon_rotational = B [1(1+1) - 0(0+1)] = B*(2) = 2 B.

Now, we need to calculate both E_vibrational and E_rotational and see which one is smaller. The photon with the lower energy would be the one that corresponds to the lower transition energy, but wait, the question asks for the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, perhaps they mean the first possible higher energy state, which would be the one with the smallest energy difference. So the photon's energy should match the smallest possible energy difference.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the next state refers to the next possible state in either rotational or vibrational, whichever is lower in energy. Alternatively, maybe the model treats the system such that the rotational and vibrational states are considered together, and the next state could involve a change in either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state for both vibration and rotation, and the next state is the first possible higher state, which would be a vibrational transition because the vibrational energy levels are higher than the rotational ones. Wait, no, the rotational energy levels are much closer together than the vibrational ones. So the energy difference between rotational levels is much smaller than that of vibrational levels.

So if the molecule is in the fundamental (v=0, j=0) state, the next possible energy state would be either j=1, v=0 or v=1, j=0. We need to calculate which of these transitions has a lower energy requirement, i.e., which requires a lower energy photon.

So let's compute both.

First, compute the vibrational energy difference. So E_vibrational = h w. Plugging in the numbers:

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.
w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E_vibrational = 6.626e-34 J·s * 4e14 rad/s = 2.65e-19 J.

Now for the rotational energy difference. First, calculate B.

B is (ħ²)/(2 I), where ħ is h/(2π), I is the moment of inertia.

I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 1.818... amu.

But we need to convert this to kilograms because the standard units are in SI.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg. Let's approximate it as 3e-27 kg for simplicity.

R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg·m².

Now, ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So B = (ħ²)/(2 I) = ( (1.0545718e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 1.2e-46 )

Calculating numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2e-46 = 2.4e-46.

So B ≈ (1.112e-68) / (2.4e-46) ) ≈ 4.633e-23 J.

The energy difference for rotational transition from j=0 to j=1 is E_rotational = 2 B = 2 * 4.633e-23 ≈ 9.266e-23 J.

Wait, but comparing E_vibrational (2.65e-19 J) and E_rotational (9.266e-23 J), the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon required for the rotational transition would have much less energy than the vibrational one.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because I thought that vibrational transitions typically require higher energy than rotational. So if the rotational transition is lower in energy, then the molecule could transition to a higher rotational state with a lower-energy photon than the vibrational transition.

So the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the rotational transition, not the vibrational one. So the photon required would be the one corresponding to the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. It says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which in the context of molecular vibrations is the ground state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (j=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the next possible higher energy state. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon would be in the microwave region (rotational transitions) whereas vibrational transitions are in the infrared.

But the question is about the photon's momentum, which depends on the energy of the photon. The energy and momentum of a photon are related by E = p c, where c is the speed of light. So p = E / c.

Wait, but in this case, the energy required is the rotational energy difference, E_rot = 9.266e-23 J. So the photon must have this energy. Therefore, its momentum p would be E_rot divided by c.

Let me compute that.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.266e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are close to that. Let me check my calculations again. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B or the moment of inertia.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations step by step.

First, find the reduced mass μ.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 1.81818... amu.

Convert μ to kg.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 ≈ let's compute this.

1.81818 * 1.66053906660e-27 ≈

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.006e-27 kg.

Ah, so perhaps I was a bit off in my earlier approximation. Let's take μ as approximately 3.006e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

Moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.006e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.006e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2024e-46 kg·m².

Now, calculate B = ħ² / (2 I).

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Divide by (2 * I) = 2 * 1.2024e-46 = 2.4048e-46 kg·m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4048e-46 ≈ 4.623e-23 J.

So E_rotational = 2B = 9.246e-23 J.

Now, the energy of the photon is 9.246e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = 9.246e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.082e-31 kg·m/s.

But wait, none of the options are close to this. Let's look at the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Hmm, none are around 3e-31, which is much smaller than the options. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should be considering the vibrational transition instead. The vibrational energy difference is h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Then, p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28.

Wait, 8.83e-28 is higher than all options except perhaps not among the choices. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I misread the question. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So maybe it's not just a single quantum transition. Wait, but the quantum numbers would change by one. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition where both rotational and vibrational states change, but that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the photon is causing a transition from the ground state to a state where either vibrational or rotational quantum numbers increase by one. Which requires less energy?

Wait, the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational one. So if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, j=0), the next higher energy state is either j=1 or v=1. Since j=1 transition requires less energy, the photon should have that energy.

Wait, but my calculation for the rotational transition gives p around 3e-31, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's vibrational transition, not the rotational. Maybe I should redo the calculation for the vibrational transition.

Wait, let me compute the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

E_photon_vibrational = h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 ≈ 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is about 8.8e-28 Ns. The options closest to this are A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28). But 8e-28 is larger than those. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is referring to the change in the rotational state within the same vibrational state. So the photon's energy corresponds to a change in j from 0 to 1, which is a rotational transition.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives a p of ~3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. None of the options match that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia.

I = μ R².

μ is in kg, R in meters.

Given that R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

μ is 1.818 amu.

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = let me calculate that.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.006e-27 kg.

So R² is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 3.006e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2024e-46 kg m².

Now, B is ħ²/(2I).

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

2I = 2 * 1.2024e-46 = 2.4048e-46 kg m².

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4048e-46 = approx 4.623e-23 J.

Thus, the energy difference for j=0 to j=1 is 2B = 9.246e-23 J.

p = E / c = 9.246e-23 / 3e8 = 3.082e-31 kg m/s, which is 3.082e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are near this value. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition but assuming a vibrational transition. So I should compute the photon's momentum based on the vibrational energy.

E_photon = 2.65e-19 J, so p = 8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Looking at the options, that's about 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, but that's about four times smaller. So maybe I made a mistake there.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the next state, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational, but that seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply considering the vibrational transition because the given angular frequency is for vibration. So the photon's energy would be h*w, and the momentum would be that energy divided by c.

Let me compute that again:

E_photon = h * w = 6.626e-34 Js * 4e14 1/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 2.6504e-19 J / 3e8 m/s = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28, but that's about 4.6 times smaller.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *4e14 = ?

6.626e-34 * 4e14 = (6.626 *4) * 1e-20 = 26.504e-20 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct.

p = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0, j=0 to v=0, j=1, which would be a rotational transition.

But earlier, that gives p around 3e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational constant B.

Wait, another approach: B is given by (h/(8 pi^2 c)) * (1/(mu R^2)) ), but wait, perhaps I should use a different formula.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recall the formula.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_j = B j (j + 1), where B is the rotational constant.

B is given by (h/(8 pi^2 I)), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, no, the correct formula is B = (ħ²)/(2 I), which is what I used earlier. But perhaps I should compute it differently.

Wait, another way: B is often expressed as (h/(8π² I c)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula is B = (h²)/(8 π² I k), but I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers, but that might not help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recompute B using the correct formula.

Let me recompute I, the moment of inertia.

I = μ R².

μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 = 1.81818... amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 3.006e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.006e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.006e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2024e-46 kg m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2 I).

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 J²·s².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.2024e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4048e-46 ≈ 4.623e-23 J.

So E Rotational (j=1 - j=0) is 2B = 9.246e-23 J.

Photon energy E = 9.246e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = 9.246e-23 / 3e8 = 3.082e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.08e-31 Ns.

Wait, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem isn't considering rotation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the transition from the ground vibrational state to the next vibrational state, which is v=1, but that would require E_photon = h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, leading to p = 8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't match that either. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 or some other consideration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is modeled as a rigid rotor, but the question says non-rigid, which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the model combines both rotational and vibrational aspects, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but considering that the bond length R is given, perhaps the moment of inertia is calculated in a different way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the photon's energy must account for both rotational and vibrational transitions, but that seems unlikely because the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state, which is a combination of both. For example, v increases by 1 and j increases by 1. But that's probably not the case, and the energy would be a sum of both changes, making the energy much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying the scenario and only considering the vibrational transition, but the options don't match.

Wait, looking at the options, the largest option is B) 2.3e-27 Ns. Let me see what energy that corresponds to.

p = 2.3e-27 Ns = kg m/s.

E = p c = 2.3e-27 kg m/s * 3e8 m/s = 6.9e-19 J.

Which is about 6.9e-19 J. Let's see what w would be.

w = E / h = 6.9e-19 J / 6.626e-34 J·s ≈ 1.04e15 rad/s.

But the given w is 4e14 rad/s, so that's higher than the given value. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, let's compute for option B:

E = 2.3e-27 * 3e8 = 6.9e-19 J.

h w = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Hmm, 6.9e-19 is larger than 2.65e-19 J. So perhaps that's not the way.

Let me compute what E_photon would be for each option.

Option A: 1.9e-28 Ns.

E = 1.9e-28 kg m/s * 3e8 m/s = 5.7e-20 J.

Which is much less than the vibrational energy of 2.65e-19 J.

Option B: 2.3e-27 Ns.

E = 2.3e-27 *3e8= 6.9e-19 J.

That's higher than the vibrational transition energy.

Wait, but the vibrational transition is E=2.65e-19 J, which would correspond to p=8.83e-28 Ns. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the energy difference required.

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (j=0). The next possible state would have either v=1 and j=0, or v=0 and j=1. Which transition requires less energy? As computed earlier, j=1 requires less energy than v=1.

So the photon should have energy equal to the rotational transition energy, which is E_rot = 2B = 9.246e-23 J.

So p = E / c = 9.246e-23 /3e8 = 3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But none of the options are close to this. So perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the vibrational transition, but then why is the answer not matching any options?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using w in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but no, the given w is in radians per second.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the photon's momentum using angular frequency.

Wait, no, photon momentum is E/c, and E is h w, regardless of the units.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state of rotation, and the next state is the first vibrational state, which would require a photon with energy E= h w.

But that still leads to p=8.83e-28 Ns, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me think: is the energy difference between j=0 and j=1 correct?

E_j = B j (j+1). So for j=0, E0 = 0. For j=1, E1 = 2B. So the difference is 2B.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the energy for a transition from the (v=0, j=0) state to the (v=1, j=0) state, which is purely vibrational.

So that would have energy difference h w = 2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options are near that. The closest is option A (1.9e-28), which is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate E_photon_vibrational.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

w =4e14 rad/s.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E / c = 2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, none match. So perhaps the problem is considering a rotational transition, but my earlier calculation for that gives p=3e-31, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit, like 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, which I think I did correctly.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is being calculated incorrectly.

mu = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 *2)/(20+2) )=40/22≈1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 = 3.006e-27 kg.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference in terms of the rotational constant B expressed in cm^-1. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference is being calculated as B (j(j+1)).

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the transition from v=0 to v=1, which requires E=h w, but the photon's momentum is p= E/c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy for a transition from (v=0,j=0) to (v=1,j=0) which is purely vibrational. So the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is from (v=0,j=0) to (v=0,j=1), which is a rotational transition requiring E=2B. So the photon's p would be 3e-31 Ns, which also isn't any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of B is correct, but let me compute B in terms of energy.

B = (h^2)/(8 pi^2 I).

Wait, let me compute B using that formula:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

I = 1.2024e-46 kg m².

So,

B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * pi² * 1.2024e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2024e-46 ≈ 8 *9.87 *1.2024e-46 ≈ 8 * 11.87e-46 ≈ 9.496e-45.

So,

B = 4.39e-67 / 9.496e-45 ≈ 4.62e-23 J.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So the energy difference is 9.246e-23 J.

Photon momentum p = 3.08e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the (v=0,j=0) state to (v=1,j=1), which would involve both vibrational and rotational changes. But that's more complicated, and I'm not sure about the energy in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next state with the lowest energy, which could be a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possible quantum numbers. The energy of each state is a sum of vibrational and rotational contributions. The next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest possible energy increment.

So, the initial state is (v=0, j=0): E_initial = (1/2) h w + 0.

The possible next states could be (v=1, j=0) or (v=0, j=1).

The energy of (v=1, j=0) is (3/2) h w.

The energy of (v=0, j=1) is (1/2) h w + 2 B.

So the energy differences are:

To (v=1, j=0): (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w.

To (v=0, j=1): (1/2 h w + 2B) - (1/2 h w) )= 2 B.

So which energy difference is smaller? h w =2.65e-19 J, 2B=9.246e-23 J.

So 2B is much smaller. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is (v=0, j=1), requiring a photon with energy 2B.

Thus, the photon's momentum is p = 2B / c.

But as before, p=3.08e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in considering whether the problem is asking for the transition to the next state in terms of energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next possible state, which could be a combination of vibrational and rotational transitions, but that would likely require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to consider only the vibrational transition, and the options have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the rotational transition. Let me compute the rotational energy difference again.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the rotational energy levels in terms of the bond length and reduced mass.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels are given by E = (ħ² j(j+1)) / (2 I).

So the difference between j=0 and j=1 would be E= (ħ² (2)) / (2 I) )= ħ² / I.

Wait, that simplifies to E= ħ² / I.

Wait, I think earlier I had E_rot = 2B = 2 (ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/I.

So yes, E_rot = ħ² / I.

So let me compute that.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

I is 1.2024e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = 1.112e-68 J² s².

E_rot = 1.112e-68 / 1.2024e-46 ≈ 9.246e-23 J.

So same as before.

Hmm, I'm stuck. The options don't match my calculations. Perhaps I should look for any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the speed of light, like 3e8 m/s is correct, but perhaps I should check the exact value.

c is 2.99792e8 m/s, which is approximately 3e8. So that shouldn't affect the result much.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, but the energy is given as E=h*w, but perhaps the problem is considering the fundamental state as the first excited state? No, the fundamental state is the ground state.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next possible state regardless of whether it's higher or lower. But that doesn't make sense because the fundamental state is the lowest.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the term "fundamental state" differently, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the transition to the next state in the rotational-vibration model, which might involve a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that's more complex and I'm not sure how to compute it.

If I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me think about the possible answers again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

The calculated p for the vibrational transition is 8.8e-28 Ns, which is not among the options. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and D (1.4e-28).

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me double-check h*w.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

h*w=6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p=2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition from j=0 to j=2, which would have an energy difference of 6B. But that would require even more energy, so p would be even larger, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the (v=0, j=0) state to the (v=0, j=1) state, which requires p=3.08e-31 Ns. But that's way below the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the term "fundamental state" to refer to the first rotational state, j=1, and the next state is j=2. But that doesn't make sense because the fundamental state would be j=0.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the vibrational transition, but the given options are off by a factor of about 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me recheck that.

Mx = 20 amu, My=2 amu.

mu = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy difference as E= B (j+1) instead of j(j+1). But that would change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational energy levels are being considered in terms of the rotational constant in wavenumbers, which is B̃ = B/(hc), but that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to find the photon's momentum in a different way, perhaps by considering the change in angular momentum. But I'm not sure how that would apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the term "momentum" in a different context, like the root mean square momentum, but that doesn't fit the scenario.

Hmm, I'm stuck. It seems like none of the options match the calculated values for either rotational or vibrational transitions. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the transition from the ground state (v=0, j=0) to the (v=1, j=0) state, but the energy is calculated as (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) )= h w, so E= h w, which gives p=8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the term "fundamental state" to refer to the first vibrational state, but that would make the initial state v=1. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first state where both v and j increase by one, but that would require a much higher energy.

I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for the option that aligns with the vibrational transition, which would be around 8.8e-28 Ns. Since none of the options are close, perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns or option B) 2.3e-27 Ns.

Wait, let me think: 2.3e-27 Ns is about 2.3e-27 kg m/s.

E = p c = 2.3e-27 *3e8 = 6.9e-19 J.

Which is about 2.6 times the vibrational energy. So perhaps that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach. Another thought: perhaps the problem is asking for the momentum of the molecule after absorbing the photon, but that's a different question.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which considers the bond length changing. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

At this point, I think I've made all the possible calculations and the correct answer based on the rotational transition isn't among the options. But perhaps the intended answer is considering the vibrational transition, and the closest option is option A) 1.9e-28 Ns, but it's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational constant B. Let me try recalculating B using the correct formula.

B = (h^2)/(8 π^2 I).

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

I=1.2024e-46 kg m².

So,

B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² *1.2024e-46 )

Calculate numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 =4.390e-67.

Denominator:8 * (pi)^2 *1.2024e-46 = 8 * 9.8696 *1.2024e-46 ≈ 8 * 11.86 *1.2024e-46 ≈ (94.88) *1.2024e-46 ≈ 1.14e-44.

So,

B=4.390e-67 /1.14e-44 ≈3.84e-23 J.

Wait, earlier calculation gave B=4.62e-23 J. Now it's 3.84e-23 J. Hmmm, did I make a mistake in the denominator?

Wait, 8 * pi² * I =8 * (9.8696) * 1.2024e-46.

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2024e-46 ≈94.9e-46 = 9.49e-45.

So denominator is 9.49e-45.

So,

B=4.39e-67 /9.49e-45 ≈4.62e-23 J.

Ah, so earlier calculation was correct. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Given that I can't find a matching option, perhaps I should select the option that corresponds to the vibrational transition, even though it's not present. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from (v=0, j=0) to (v=0, j=2), which would have E=6B. Let me compute that.

E=6B=6 *4.62e-23=2.772e-22 J.

p=2.772e-22 /3e8 =9.24e-24 kg m/s =9.24e-24 Ns.

Which is still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition from (v=0, j=0) to (v=1, j=1), which would involve both vibrational and rotational changes. The energy would be E= h w + 2B.

h w=2.65e-19 J.

2B=9.246e-23 J.

So E=2.65e-19 +9.246e-23 ≈2.65e-19 J.

p=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 Ns. Still no match.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option A) 1.9e-28 Ns, but I can't find a justification for it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rotational transition.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the photon's momentum is being considered as the change in angular momentum. But I'm not sure how that applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use the vibrational energy, and the correct option is none of the above, but that's not an option.

Given that I can't find a matching option, perhaps the correct answer is option C)1.1e-27 Ns, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula E_photon = h f, where f is frequency. But I've already used w as angular frequency.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the wavelength instead of energy. But I don't have the wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to calculate the momentum change of the molecule upon absorbing the photon, but that's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rotational constant B in cm^-1, but I'm not sure.

I think I've tried all possible approaches and can't find a matching option. Perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The given parameters are:

- Mass of atom X: \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of atom Y: \( M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)
- Bond length: \( R = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)
- Angular frequency of vibration: \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Key Analysis:

1. **Energy Levels in the Rotation-Vibration Model**:
   - The energy levels of the molecule are determined by both vibrational and rotational contributions.
   - The vibrational energy levels are given by \( E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \), where \( v \) is the vibrational quantum number.
   - The rotational energy levels are given by \( E_j = B j(j+1) \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) is the rotational constant, and \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia. Here, \( \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} \) is the reduced mass.

2. **Fundamental State**:
   - The fundamental state corresponds to \( v = 0 \) (lowest vibrational state) and \( j = 0 \) (lowest rotational state).

3. **Next State with the Lowest Energy**:
   - The next possible states are:
     - \( (v=1, j=0) \): Purely vibrational transition with energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = h \omega \).
     - \( (v=0, j=1) \): Purely rotational transition with energy difference \( \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = 2B \).
   - Comparing the energy differences:
     - \( \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
     - \( \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = 2B \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \). The reduced mass \( \mu = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.006 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \), and \( I = \mu R^2 = 3.006 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2024 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2 \). Thus, \( B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.2024 \times 10^{-46}} = 4.623 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and \( \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = 2B = 9.246 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).
   - Since \( \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} \ll \Delta E_{\text{vibrational}} \), the next state with the lowest energy is \( (v=0, j=1) \).

4. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The energy of the photon required for the rotational transition is \( E_{\text{photon}} = \Delta E_{\text{rotational}} = 9.246 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus, \( p = \frac{9.246 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.082 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \).

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated momentum \( p = 3.082 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the vibrational transition corresponds to \( p = \frac{h \omega}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), which is also not listed.
   - Among the options, the closest match to the vibrational transition is **Option A** (\( p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)), though it is smaller by a factor of approximately 4.6.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, even though the calculated value does not match any option exactly. Based on the given choices, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: A**
