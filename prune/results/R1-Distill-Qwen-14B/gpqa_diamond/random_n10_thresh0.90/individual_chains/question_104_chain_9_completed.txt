Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Two stars, same masses as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the star moves toward us, the spectral lines shift blueward (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, they shift redward (longer wavelength). The periodic shift tells us about the planet's influence on the star's motion.

Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Hmm. So, how does the RV method relate the shift to the planet's orbital period?

I remember that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital parameters. The formula I think is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )) )^(1/2) ). Wait, maybe I should think about the relation between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) )^(1/3) ) * (something else... maybe not. Maybe I should look for a simplified version.

Alternatively, I've heard that the RV semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, assuming that the planet's mass and the star's mass are similar. Because the stars are the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune, but wait, Neptune is much smaller than the Sun, so M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_* for both stars.

So, the formula for the semi-amplitude K when M_p << M_* is approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) )^(1/ something... wait, perhaps the formula is more accurately written as:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe another approach. Since both stars are the same (solar mass), and both planets have similar masses, maybe we can relate the semi-amplitude shifts to the orbital periods.

In the RV method, if the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is larger, that could be due to a more massive planet or a shorter orbital period. But wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) )

But perhaps for a circular orbit (e=0), and with M_p << M_*, this simplifies.

Let me try to think of the relation between K and P. If all else is equal, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, if K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of Planet #1 and #2 respectively, and P1 and P2 their periods, then:

K ∝ (M_p) / (P^(1/3))

But wait, the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same. So, K ∝ 1/ (P^(1/3)).

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But in the problem, the shift in wavelength is 5 and 7 milliangstroms. Wait, what's the relation between the Doppler shift and the velocity? The Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is proportional to the velocity. So, the semi-amplitude of velocity K is proportional to the shift in wavelength. So, K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So,

K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (25/49) ≈ 0.5102.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because K is proportional to the velocity semi-amplitude. So, K is proportional to the Doppler shift. So if K1 is smaller than K2 (5 <7), that means Planet #1 causes a smaller velocity change in its star than Planet #2 does. 

Wait, but according to the formula, K is (something) / (P^(1/3)), so higher K means smaller P. So, if K1 is smaller than K2, then P1 must be longer than P2? Or wait, no.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write the formula correctly.

Yes, the formula for K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e² )^(0.5) ) ) * ( 1 / ( P )^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me get the formula correct. The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p )^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2 pi c) / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look for a simpler relation. Since the question gives the same mass for the stars and similar masses for the planets, we can assume that sin i is the same (i.e., both orbits are edge-on, but the question doesn't state this, but for the sake of the problem, perhaps it's assumed equal). Also, since the planets have similar masses, M_p is similar, so let's take M_p as the same for both.

So, for both planets, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_* and M_p are same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So:

K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Because K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const

K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

We can rearrange:

(P2 / P1 ) = (K1 / K2 )^3

Given that K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, K1/K2 =5/7.

So,

P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Which is approximately 0.36, so the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning planet #2's period is shorter. So, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's only about 0.36 as long. So, it's shorter.

Wait, but the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?

If the ratio is 0.36, then P2 is 0.36 times P1, which would mean it's shorter. So, planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's. So, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. If it's 0.36 times, then it's shorter, so the ratio is less than 1. So, the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly.

The shift is 5 for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, K is larger for planet #2. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), a larger K implies a smaller P. So, planet #2 has a smaller period than planet #1.

So, P2 is smaller than P1. So, the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1? That's P2/P1. Which is 0.36 times. So, P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1, so it's shorter.

So, the answer would be 0.36. So, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but wait, I think I may have mixed up the proportionality.

Wait, because K is the velocity semi-amplitude, which is the maximum velocity of the star. So, a larger K means the star is moving faster, which would happen for a planet with a shorter orbital period (because the force is stronger, or the planet is more massive, but in this case, the planet masses are similar).

Alternatively, let me think about the relation between K and P.

In the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / ( (M_*)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity (K), which is the semi-amplitude.

So, K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), as earlier.

So, K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, solving for P2/P1:

(P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. So, it's shorter, not longer. But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1? That ratio is 0.36, which is less than 1, so P2 is shorter, not longer. So, the answer would be 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, given that both planets were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \), which is proportional to the Doppler shift, is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), assuming the stars and planets have similar masses and circular orbits.

The relationship between \( K \) and \( P \) can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that Planet #1 causes a Doppler shift of 5 milliangstroms (\( K_1 = 5 \)) and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms (\( K_2 = 7 \)), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

Using the proportionality \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) is related to the ratio of \( K_1 / K_2 \) by:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging for \( P_2 / P_1 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
