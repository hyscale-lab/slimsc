Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx. Hmm, I need to think about the relationship between parallax and distance, and how star distribution affects this.

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. Right, the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller. Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—does that mean the same number per unit volume? I think so. Because in a uniform distribution, the density is constant.

So, the number of stars in a given volume depends on that volume. Let me imagine a sphere with radius d. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πd³. If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell would be about 4πd² dr. That makes sense because the surface area of a sphere is 4πd², and dr is the thickness.

Now, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume, since the density is uniform. So, stars per unit volume is constant, let's say n. So the number of stars in the shell would be n * 4πd² dr. 

But we're interested in the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me make a substitution: d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. So, when d increases, plx decreases.

Wait, I'm looking for the number of stars per unit plx. So, for a small change in plx, how does that relate to the distance? Let's say I have a small change in plx, delta plx. Then, delta d would be delta (1/plx) = -1/(plx²) delta plx. Hmm, maybe. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. So, d = 1/plx. The volume element in terms of d is 4πd² dr, but dr is the change in d. Let me express dr in terms of delta plx.

Differentiating d = 1/(plx), so dr = - (1/(plx)^2) d plx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're dealing with absolute changes, maybe I can ignore the sign. So, dr = (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

Now, the number of stars between plx and plx + d plx is n * 4πd² * dr. Substituting d = 1/plx, d^2 is 1/plx², and dr is (1/plx²) d plx. So putting it all together:

Number of stars = n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx. 

Wait, that would be n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx. So, the number per unit plx (d plx is 1) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So that would suggest the number of stars per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. So that's option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check because sometimes these problems can be tricky. Are we considering the number per unit parallax or per unit distance? In this case, it's per unit parallax. So, the reasoning seems to hold. So the number of stars in a thin shell of parallax thickness d plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct option should be A.

But another angle: if I think about how the number of stars varies with d, and then change variables to plx. Since plx is 1/d, and the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional to d². But that's per unit distance. When I change variables to plx, I have to account for the change in variable.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential number of stars. Let’s say N is the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + d plx.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to d^2 * dr (because volume is 4πd² dr). Since d = 1/plx, dr = - (d plx) / plx². So, d plx is the change in parallax. Substituting, we get d plx = - (plx²) dr.

So, dr = - (d plx) / plx². But for the number N, we have:

N = (number density) * 4πd² * dr.

Substituting dr from above:

N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (-d plx / plx² )

The negative sign just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes here, we'll ignore it. So,

N = n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx = 1) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I've heard that the number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so the number of stars in a shell should depend on the surface area and the thickness. But converting to parallax adds a factor because the thickness in plx isn't linear in distance.

Alternatively, thinking about the differential number of stars per unit parallax. The number of stars dN in a thin shell is proportional to the volume element, which is 4πd² dr. But dr = (d plx) / (plx²), because plx = 1/d → d plx = - dr / d² → dr = - d plx * d². Wait, maybe I should be more precise.

Actually, if plx = 1/d, then d plx = - (1/d^2) dd. So dd = - d^2 d plx.

But 4πd² dr → 4πd² (dd) (since dr is differential in d). Wait, no, I think I made a mistake before. Let me re-express this.

The volume element in shells is 4πd² dd, where dd is the change in d. Since plx = 1/d, dd = - (d²) d plx. So substituting:

dN = n * 4π d² (dd) = n *4 π d² (-d² d plx) ) → n *4 π (d^4) (-d plx).

But d = 1/plx, so d^4 is (1/plx)^4. So:

dN = n *4 π (1/plx^4) (-d plx)

But again, since we're considering the magnitude, negative sign indicates direction, so ignoring it:

dN = n *4 π (1/plx^4) d plx

So per unit plx (d plx =1), dN = (n *4 π ) (1/plx^4 )

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d},
\]

where \(d\) is the distance to the star in parsecs. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dr\) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 dr.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then proportional to \(4\pi d^2 dr\), assuming a constant number density of stars.

To relate this to parallax, we express \(d\) in terms of plx: \(d = 1/\text{plx}\). Substituting this into the volume element, we get:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dr.
\]

Next, we express \(dr\) in terms of a small change in parallax, \(d\text{plx}\). Differentiating \(d = 1/\text{plx}\), we find:

\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Substituting \(dr\) into the volume element:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{Volume} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \(1/\text{plx}^4\). This corresponds to option A.
