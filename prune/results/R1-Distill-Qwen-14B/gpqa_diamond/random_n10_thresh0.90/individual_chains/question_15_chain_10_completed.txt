Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one that's more likely to transit, so they'll choose the one with a higher probability. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits. 

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But wait, both stars have the same radii because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_orb / R_star)), where a_orb is the orbital distance.

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact formula. The transit probability (P) is given by P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (M_s / M_p)^(1/3))) ), but wait, no, that's more for the Doppler method. Alternatively, for transit probability, it's the area of the planet's disk divided by the area of the star's disk, multiplied by something else. Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the impact parameter term, but wait, the impact parameter affects whether it transits or not, but the probability is about the chance that the orbit's inclination is such that it transits.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a_orb/(R_s))), no, wait, let me think. I think the transit probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. Oh right! The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (a_orb/(R_s))) ), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / (R_s * sqrt(1 - e^2))) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/(a/(R_s)) )). But wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think again.

Another approach: The chance of a planet transiting is higher if the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's disk size to the planet's orbital distance. So, the probability P is approximately (R_s / a)^2 * (R_p / R_s)^2. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the probability of transit is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 + (R_s / a)^2)) ). Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the reciprocal of (a/(R_s)) ), but I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability of a transit is given by the formula:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a * sin(i), but that's not exactly it. Wait, no, the transit probability is the volume of the cone where the planet's path would cross the star's disk, divided by the total volume of possible inclinations. Alternatively, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) )) )? Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, I think the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a / R_s)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a / R_s)), but that might not be correct. Let me think about the units. a is in AU or meters, R_s is radius of star, same units. R_p is planet radius, same units.

Wait, the correct formula I remember is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a / R_s)). So if a is the orbital distance, R_s is the star's radius, and R_p is the planet's radius.

Wait, but wait, a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So for a circular orbit, a is the distance from the star.

But I think the formula is more accurately: P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) )) ), but that would be (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a) = (R_p^2 R_s) / (R_s^2 a) ) = (R_p^2) / (R_s a) ), so P = (R_p²) / (R_s a).

Wait, that seems possible. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_p²) / (R_s a).

Wait, but wait, another formula I've come across is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a/(R_s))) ), but that would be (R_p²)/(R_s²) * (R_s/a) ) = R_p²/(R_s a). So yes, same as before.

So, P = (R_p^2) / (R_s * a).

But wait, in this problem, both planets have the same mass, but that's not directly relevant for the transit probability, as transit probability depends on size, not mass. So, the transit probability depends on R_p, R_s, and a.

But wait, I think the actual transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) )). Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to look it up mentally.

Another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block (which is π R_p²) to the area of the star's disk (which is π R_s²), multiplied by the solid angle where the planet's path would cross the star. Alternatively, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (a/(R_s) )) ). Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by (a/(R_s)), which is (R_p^2)/(R_s^2) * (R_s/a) ) = R_p^2/(R_s a).

So P = (R_p^2) / (R_s a).

But I'm not entirely sure, but let's proceed with this formula.

Now, given that, let's compute for each planet.

But wait, we don't know the planet's radius. The question states that both are Earth-like, so perhaps assuming R_p is the same for both planets. But the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can assume R_p1 = R_p2 = R_earth.

So, let's compute P for each.

P = (R_p^2) / ( R_s * a )

We need a for each planet. The orbital period is given, so using Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G(M_s + M_p) * P^2 ) / (4 π² )

But since M_p is much less than M_s, we can approximate M_s + M_p ≈ M_s.

So a^3 = ( G M_s P^2 ) / (4 π^2 )

So a = [ ( G M_s P^2 ) / (4 π^2 ) ]^(1/3 )

But since both planets have the same mass, but P1 is 1/3 of P2.

Wait, no, Planet_1 has a shorter period: its orbital period is three times shorter. So P1 = P2 / 3.

But the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive as the host of Planet_2. So M_s1 = 2 M_s2.

So let's denote M_s2 as M, M_s1 = 2M.

So for Planet_1:

a1^3 = ( G * 2M * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

And for Planet_2:

a2^3 = ( G * M * P2^2 ) / (4 π² )

So, taking the ratio a1^3 / a2^3 = ( (2M) ( (P2/3)^2 ) ) / ( M P2^2 ) ) = (2 * (P2^2)/(9 P2^2) ) ) = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) = a2 * (2^(1/3))/(9^(1/3)) ) → 9^(1/3) is (3^2)^(1/3) = 3^(2/3) ≈ 2.08.

Wait, 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 9^(1/3) is about 2.08. So a1/a2 ≈ (1.26)/(2.08) ≈ 0.605.

So a1 is about 0.605 times a2.

Now, let's compute the transit probability for each.

P1 = (R_p1^2) / (R_s1 * a1 )

P2 = (R_p2^2) / (R_s2 * a2 )

But since R_p1 = R_p2 = R_earth, R_p1^2 = R_p2^2.

So P1/P2 = [ (1/(R_s1 a1 )) ] / [ (1/(R_s2 a2 )) ] = ( R_s2 a2 ) / ( R_s1 a1 )

We know from the problem that both host stars have the same radii. R_s1 = R_s2.

So R_s2 / R_s1 = 1.

Thus, P1/P2 = (a2) / (a1)

But earlier, a1 is 0.605 a2.

So a2/a1 = 1 / 0.605 ≈ 1.652.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculation.

Because P1 = (R_p²) / ( R_s1 * a1 )

P2 = (R_p²) / ( R_s2 * a2 )

Since R_s1 = R_s2, P1/P2 = (1/(a1)) / (1/(a2)) ) = a2 / a1.

Which is a2 /a1 = (a2 / a1 ) = (a2 / (0.605 a2 )) ) = 1 / 0.605 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D says ~2.7 times.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I get a1 and a2 correctly?

Let me recalculate the a ratio.

a1^3 = (2 M) * (P1)^2 / (4 pi^2 )

But P1 = P2 /3 → (P1)^2 = (P2^2)/9.

So a1^3 = (2 M * (P2^2 /9 )) / (4 pi^2 ) )

a2^3 = (M * P2^2 ) / (4 pi^2 )

So a1^3 / a2^3 = [2 M (P2^2/9) ] / [M P2^2 ] = 2/(9) → 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3):

2/9 is approximately 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.606, so a1 = a2 * 0.606.

So a2/a1 = 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 = a2/(a1) = 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but the question says that the researchers have to choose which planet to observe. So if P1 is higher, they should prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option C is option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.

So the correct answer would be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula:

\[
P = \frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a}
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius, \( R_s \) is the star's radius, and \( a \) is the planet's orbital distance from the star. Since both planets are Earth-like, we assume \( R_p \) is the same for both. Additionally, the problem states that both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), so this term cancels out when comparing the two planets.

The orbital distance \( a \) can be derived from Kepler's third law:

\[
a^3 = \frac{G M_s P^2}{4 \pi^2}
\]

where \( M_s \) is the star's mass and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1, \( M_s = 2M \) (twice the mass of Planet_2's host star), and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (three times shorter orbital period than Planet_2). Using these relationships, the ratio of the orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{(2M) \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \).

The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a_1}}{\frac{R_p^2}{R_s \cdot a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.605 \cdot a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.605 \cdot a_2} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
