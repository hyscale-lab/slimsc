Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about all the reactions involved. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The first part of the question is about heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. This is probably a dehydrohalogenation reaction.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent carbons. Heating with KOH would likely remove both bromine atoms and form a double bond. The product from this reaction is product 1. The NMR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is probably the -OH protons from a ketone or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but wait! The IR spectrum has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). So that suggests that product 1 is a ketone. Hmm, wait, but I thought elimination would give an alkene. Did I get that right?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing something. Let me think again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If it's treated with excess KOH, what reaction occurs? Oh wait, perhaps it's a double elimination. So, if two vicinal bromides are present, maybe each loses HBr. So, each Br is on a different carbon, adjacent to each other. So when KOH is added, perhaps two E2 eliminations occur, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. Oh wait, but that would produce an alkene. But the product's NMR shows an O-H peak? Or wait, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). Let me think: in an E2 elimination, you get an alkene, but if it's a di-halide elimination, maybe it's a conjugated diene? Or maybe it's a more complex structure.

Wait, but the IR peak at 1720 is a big clue. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a ketone group. How does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane?

Oh wait! Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but Hofmann usually produces amines. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation where the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, and the Br leaves, but if there's another Br adjacent, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base and poor nucleophile in such conditions, but more likely, elimination would occur. But if we have two adjacent Br atoms, maybe it's a di-elimination to form a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, another possibility: if the structure is such that eliminating two HBr molecules leads to a ring structure with a carbonyl. Because adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two Brs in a way that when both are eliminated, maybe a bridgehead carbonyl forms. Oh, perhaps it's forming an adamantyl structure with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more of a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a peroxide effect, but I don't think KOH would provide that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone? Or maybe a cyclopropane ring? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR of product 1. The 1H NMR shows:

4.79 (2H) – probably an -OH group, but wait, in D2O, the -OH would exchange and not appear. Unless it's a ketone enol, but that's unlikely. Wait, 4.79 ppm is more typical for a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or a ketone. Alternatively, it could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in a geminal diol (but that's more like 3-4 ppm). Alternatively, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in a ketone where the carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group.

Wait, wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 has a ketone group. So, the reaction must have formed a ketone.

So, how does that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Oh! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism or some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination, but pinacol involves diols.

Wait, another possibility: when you have two vicinal bromides, perhaps the base induces an elimination to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a double elimination where each Br leaves, and two Hs are abstracted, forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, like the formation of a ketone from a 1,2-dibromide. I think when a 1,2-dibromide is treated with a strong base, it can undergo a double elimination, losing two HBr molecules and forming a carbonyl group. Because each Br is on adjacent carbons, so each elimination would form a double bond, but if the two eliminations are on the same side, maybe they form a carbonyl.

Wait, but in the case of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps it's a bridge structure. So, the two Brs are on adjacent bridgehead carbons, and eliminating two HBr would form a bridgehead carbonyl group. So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone or something similar. That would fit with the carbonyl IR peak.

So, product 1 is a ketone, like 1,3-adamantanone.

Next step: product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Hmm. What's aluminum isopropoxide used for? I think it's a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 is a ketone. So maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is reacting in a nucleophilic addition. But wait, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's undergoing a Claisen or aldol condensation? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening.

Wait, another thought: the second step uses aluminum isopropoxide, which is a catalyst for Friedel-Crafts. But product 1 is a ketone. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts acylation uses a ketone as the acylating agent. So perhaps product 2 is the result of a Friedel-Crafts acylation of some aromatic ring. Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so if product 1 is the acylating agent, then product 2 would be an aromatic compound with an acyl group attached.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention an aromatic starting material, so perhaps I'm off track. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the process is a ring-opening of the adamantane structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an alpha-diketone? No, because the starting material had two Br atoms on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a single ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclopropane ring with a ketone? Not sure.

Alternatively, another approach. Product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone. Then, when heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of rearrangement. Or maybe it's a Birch reduction? No, Birch is with metals and ammonia, I think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Grignard reaction, but Grignard reagents require a solvent like ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is undergoing a keto-enol tautomerism or some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage of the carbonyl group. Wait, but aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, maybe it's used to catalyze a decomposition reaction.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, and when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a diol. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Dieckmann condensation if it's a cyclic ketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle. The next step is ozone being bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide (which is a reductive work-up), leading to product 3. So, ozonolysis is usually used to cleave alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis acts on alkenes.

So, product 2 is an alkene, and ozonolysis breaks it into carbonyls.

So, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

So, let's go back. Product 1 is the ketone. Then, product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. So, product 2 must have a double bond because ozonolysis is done on it.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether formed by some kind of elimination. Or perhaps product 1 is being deprotonated and then forms an enolate which tautomerizes.

Wait, another thought: perhaps product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, and when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes a ring-opening to form a conjugated diene. Or perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement where the ketone is converted into an alkene.

Wait, the pinacol rearrangement involves the dehydration of a 1,2-diol (pinacol) to form a ketone (pinacolone), but here product 1 is a ketone. Alternatively, the reverse, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is undergoing a keto-enol tautomerism to form an enol, which could then undergo some reaction, but I'm not sure how that would form an alkene.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, and product 2 is formed via a Diels-Alder reaction, but without a diene, I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about what product 1's structure is. Let's imagine 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are bridgehead carbons, each with a Br.

When KOH is added, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination. Each Br leaves with a β-hydrogen, forming a double bond. But wait, since they're on adjacent bridgeheads, eliminating two HBr would form a bridgehead double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are generally not allowed due to Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead double bonds are not stable in small bicyclic systems. So, perhaps instead, the elimination leads to a ring-opening or a rearrangement that forms a more stable structure.

Wait, perhaps the two eliminations form a conjugated diene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone via a different mechanism. Let me think about the possible product.

Wait, another idea: if the base (KOH) abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. For example, each Br could be eliminated with a neighboring H to form a carbonyl. If each Br is on adjacent carbons, maybe both are eliminated to form a single ketone.

So, for instance, structure could be:

Br
|
C - C
   |
   Br

Eliminating both HBr would form a double bond, but that leads to an alkene. But in a bridgehead, that's not allowed. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe each Br is on a different bridgehead, and eliminating two HBr leads to a bridgehead carbonyl group, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene that's less strained. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps the product 1 is a diketone. But that would require two carbonyl groups, and the starting material is dibrominated. So, perhaps elimination of two HBr from each adjacent Br would form two carbonyls. But I'm not sure how the structure would look.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But KOH is a strong base, and more likely to cause elimination, especially with vicinal dihalides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a single elimination, giving an alkene, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. So I'm a bit stuck on product 1.

Wait, perhaps the NMR data can help. The NMR of product 1 has 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) region suggests perhaps some CH2 or CH groups in the adamantane structure, and 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's 1-adamantanone. So, the structure would have a ketone at position 1 of the adamantane. The NMR would then show the ketone's neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, in 1-adamantanone, the carbonyl is at one bridgehead. The structure would have a CH2 group next to the carbonyl. So, perhaps the 4.79 ppm peak is a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, but 4.79 is a bit upfield for a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Typically, such groups are around 2.1-2.5 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 4.79 is a different group, like an -OCH2- group. But I don't see oxygen elsewhere yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.79 is a -CH2-O- group, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe product 1 isn't a ketone but an alcohol. But the IR would then show an O-H stretch around 3300 cm⁻¹, which isn't mentioned here. The IR here shows 1720, which is more carbonyl.

So, product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So, back to the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-dialkyl ketone, but I don't think so.

Another approach: the problem mentions that product 2 is then ozonolyzed. Ozonolysis cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So, product 2 must have an alkene. Which implies that product 2 is an alkene, and product 1 must have undergone a reaction to form that.

So, product 1 (a ketone) is heated with aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2 (an alkene). What reaction could convert a ketone into an alkene when treated with a Lewis acid?

One possibility is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a ketone to form an alkene. But wait, that usually requires a β-hydroxy ketone (like in the pinacol rearrangement), but product 1 is a ketone, perhaps without any hydroxyl groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ketone undergoes a ring-opening to form an enol ether, which can then eliminate to form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing a keto-enol tautomerism to form an enol, which then under acidic conditions could lose a water molecule to form an alkene.

Wait, but without a hydroxyl group, I'm not sure how that would happen. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is part of a cyclic structure that, under certain conditions, can form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is undergoing a Claisen-like condensation, but that usually forms a β-keto ester, which isn't relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the ketone is undergoing a [1,2]-shift under acidic conditions, forming a more stable carbocation. But then to form an alkene, elimination would need to occur.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe when treated with a Lewis acid like Al(OiPr)3, it's activated for some kind of elimination. For instance, the ketone could be part of a cyclic structure that can open to form a conjugated diene or a more substituted alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is at a bridgehead, and under acidic conditions, it's more stable to form an alkene elsewhere.

But I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps product 2 is a bicyclic alkene formed by the loss of CO2 or some other group. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the reaction conditions for product 2 are heating with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Another possible reaction is the formation of an enol ether from a ketone via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. Enol ethers can undergo elimination to form alkenes. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is an alkene formed by a conjugate elimination. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a dienone, which upon treatment with a Lewis acid, undergoes some rearrangement to form a conjugated diene, which is product 2.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should think about the ozonolysis part.

Product 2 is ozonolyzed, leading to product 3. Ozonolysis of a diene would typically form two carbonyl groups. For example, a conjugated diene would break into two aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution. If product 2 is a cyclohexene, ozonolysis would give two aldehydes. But in this case, product 3's NMR is of interest.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Wait, the most deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative groups, like carbonyls. So, in product 3, which is an ozonolysis product, perhaps it's a diketone or two aldehyde groups.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H. If product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclohexene, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. Each aldehyde has a -CHO group. The protons on the carbonyl are typically split due to coupling with adjacent groups.

Wait, but for aldehydes, the protons are usually a singlet because they're next to a carbonyl. But in some cases, if the aldehyde is part of a larger structure, the adjacent groups might cause splitting.

Wait, but perhaps product 2 is a more complex structure. Let's think: product 2 is an alkene derived from product 1, which is a ketone.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a di-substituted alkene, and when ozonolysed, it breaks into two carbonyl groups. Product 3 would then have two carbonyl groups, perhaps as two aldehydes or ketones.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a tri-substituted or tetra-substituted alkene, leading to different products upon ozonolysis.

But the key is in the coupling pattern of the most deshielded H in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

In ozonolysis, the reductive work-up (with dimethyl sulfide) typically leads to the formation of aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution of the double bond.

Wait, let's think about a specific example: if product 2 is a simple alkene like 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. Each aldehyde's H would be a singlet, but perhaps if there's some coupling with adjacent H's, it could split into a doublet or something else.

But wait, in the case of a terminal alkyne, the proton is a singlet. But in case of an aldehyde, the H is attached to a carbonyl, and if the adjacent carbon has H's, those could cause coupling.

Wait, for example, if product 3 is a diketone, the H's on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups would couple with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a cyclic diene, like cyclohexene. Ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups, each with a H. Those H's would be adjacent to each other if it's a six-membered ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the product 3's NMR isn't given, so perhaps I should think about the structure more carefully.

Let me try to reconstruct the entire process.

1,3-dibromoadamantane → KOH → product 1 (a ketone, likely 1,3-adamantanone)

Product 1 → Al(OiPr)3 → product 2 (an alkene)

Product 2 → ozonolysis → product 3 (two carbonyl groups)

So, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. Now, the NMR of product 3 is to be considered.

The most deshielded H would be on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. For instance, in an aldehyde, the H is on the carbonyl carbon.

Wait, but in an aldehyde, the H is usually a singlet because the neighboring C doesn't have any Hs (since the aldehyde is RCHO, the next C is the adjacent R group, which may or may not have Hs). But if the aldehyde is part of a larger structure, like RCH2CHO, then the H on the CH2 next to the aldehyde would be split.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone, so the H's adjacent to the ketone would be split.

Wait, but in the case of a diketone, like (CH2)2(CO)2, the Hs on either side of the carbonyl groups would not be adjacent to each other, so their coupling would be minimal.

Wait, another possibility: product 2 is a mono-alkene, perhaps 1,3-pentadiene, which upon ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. Each aldehyde's H would be adjacent only to the carbonyl, so no splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated diene, which upon ozonolysis would give two carbonyl groups, but the structure would influence the coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps product 3 is a diketone with a structure like O=C-R-CH2-CO-.

Wait, let's think about the structure of product 2. If product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, and product 2 is an alkene derived from it, perhaps it's a ring-opening to form a conjugated diene or a more substituted alkene.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives the options for the coupling pattern. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and pentet.

Each of these coupling patterns suggests a certain number of neighboring protons.

A triplet implies coupling with two equivalent protons.

A triplet of triplets would be coupling with two sets of two protons each.

A doublet of triplets would be coupling with two different sets, perhaps one with two protons and another with three.

A pentet is coupling with four equivalent protons.

The most deshielded H would likely be next to a carbonyl group. So, for example, if the H is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, and that carbon is connected to another CH2 group, then the H would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, resulting in a triplet.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the structure is R-CO-CH2-CH2-R'. The H on the CH2 next to the CO would have neighboring Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H on the first CH2 would see two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the H is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH is next to another CH2 group with two Hs, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, another scenario: the H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Then, each H on that CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, causing a triplet.

But if the CH2 is next to another CH with three Hs, that's not possible because a CH can only have one H if it's a CH, but wait, that's not correct. Wait, a CH is a carbon with two Hs? No, a CH has one H. So, perhaps if the H is on a CH2 next to a CH group, which has one H, and another CH2 with two Hs, the coupling would be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 group, which is adjacent to a CH group. So, that H would couple with two Hs on one adjacent CH2 and one H on another, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of a specific example.

Suppose product 3 is a diketone with a structure like (CH2)2(CO)2. Then, each CH2 adjacent to CO would have two Hs on each CH2. The H on one CH2 would see the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, in that case, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to CO) would be a triplet.

Looking at the options, option A is a triplet.

Alternatively, if the structure is more complex, the coupling might be more.

Wait, but let me think again.

If product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups. But each aldehyde's H doesn't have adjacent Hs, so their NMR would be singlet. But that wouldn't match the options given.

Alternatively, if product 2 is a cyclic diene, ozonolysis would give two aldehyde groups connected by a chain. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-cyclohexadiene, ozonolysis would break the ring into two aldehyde groups with a chain in between. So, the structure would be something like O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO.

In that case, the Hs on the CH2 groups would be adjacent to the aldehyde groups. The CH2 groups next to aldehyde would have Hs that couple with each other. For example, the H on the first CH2 would be next to the aldehyde and the next CH2. The next CH2's Hs would be next to the first CH2 and the other aldehyde.

Wait, let me imagine the structure O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO.

The Hs on the CH2 groups would be adjacent to each other. So, each H on the middle CH2 would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, the Hs on the middle CH2 would be a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but that's more than one coupling. Alternatively, each H on the middle CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the left CH2 and the two Hs on the right CH2. So, each H would have four neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet (or pentet), which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO. The Hs on the middle CH2 are each adjacent to two Hs on each neighboring CH2. So, each H on the middle CH2 is split by two neighboring Hs on each side, which would give a triplet of triplet? Or is it a quintet?

Wait, when a proton is coupled with two sets of equivalent protons, the splitting can be multiplicative. For example, if a proton is split by two equivalent protons (n=2), it becomes a triplet. If it's split by two different sets of two equivalent protons each, it becomes a triplet of triplets.

In the case of O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO, the middle CH2's Hs are each adjacent to two Hs on the left CH2 and two Hs on the right CH2. So each H on the middle CH2 is split by two Hs on the left and two on the right.

Wait, but that's four Hs. So, each H would have four neighboring Hs, leading to a quintet. Because n=4, the number of peaks is n+1=5, so a pentet.

So, the most deshielded H would be the ones on the CH2 groups adjacent to the aldehyde, which would be a pentet.

But another possibility: the Hs on the CH2 next to the aldehyde are each coupled with two Hs from the adjacent CH2. So, each H on that CH2 is split into a triplet.

Wait, but the splitting is from each adjacent group. The Hs on the CH2 next to aldehyde (left and right) would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

Wait, let me imagine the structure:

O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO

The Hs on the left CH2 (between O=CH and CH2) would each be next to the two Hs on the middle CH2. So, each H on the left CH2 would couple with two Hs, giving a triplet. Similarly, the Hs on the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet of triplets. Wait, but that's more than two sets.

Alternatively, perhaps each H on the middle CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the left and two on the right, but since they are equivalent on each side, it's treated as four Hs, leading to a quintet.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. But looking at the options, option D is a pentet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is if the H is on a CH group next to a carbonyl, and that CH is next to a CH2 group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHO. In such a case, the H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the CH2 and the one H on the adjacent CH group. But that might lead to a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a six-membered ring with two aldehyde groups, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, going back to the initial steps. Product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an alkene, product 3 is the ozonolysis product.

If product 2 is a substituted alkene, perhaps it's a disubstituted or trisubstituted, leading to different products.

Another approach: the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded H is probably adjacent to a carbonyl group, as that's where the deshielding occurs.

If the most deshielded H is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group, which is next to another group, then the coupling could be a triplet.

Wait, but I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think about the possible structures leading to each option.

Option A: triplet. This would happen if the H is coupled with two equivalent Hs, such as being next to a CH2 group.

Option B: triplet of triplets. This would happen if the H is coupled with two sets of two Hs, such as being next to two different CH2 groups.

Option C: doublet of triplets. Maybe coupled with two Hs and another group with three Hs, but that's less likely.

Option D: pentet. This would happen if the H is coupled with four equivalent Hs, perhaps two on each side.

Wait, another thought: the H in question is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. The CH2 is between two carbonyl groups. So, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-. Then, each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would see four Hs, leading to a pentet.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CHO, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two Hs, each coupled with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So, each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the middle CH2 would have each H coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So, each H would see four Hs, leading to a pentet.

So, in that case, the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to the aldehyde) would be a pentet. Hmm.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the H is on a CH group next to a carbonyl, and that CH is next to a CH2 with two Hs. So, the H would couple with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again. The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

The most deshielded H is likely on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. If that CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, then the Hs would have two neighboring CH2 groups on each side. Wait, that's not possible because each CH2 can only be between two carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and next to another CH. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHO. The Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the product 3 is a diketone with the structure O=C-R-CH2-CH2-CO-. In this case, the Hs on the CH2 next to the ketone would be a triplet due to coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2.

If that's the case, the H would be a triplet (option A).

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the IR of product 1 has a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So, product 1 is a ketone. When product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it undergoes a ring-opening to form a conjugated diene. For example, the ketone group could be part of a cyclic structure that, upon acid treatment, forms a conjugated diene.

If product 2 is a conjugated diene, like 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would break it into two aldehyde groups. So, product 3 would be O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO.

In this structure, the Hs on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H on the middle CH2 would be split by four Hs (two on each side), leading to a quintet. But wait, in reality, each H on the middle CH2 would be next to two Hs on the left and two on the right, which are equivalent.

Wait, but the splitting would be for each adjacent group. So, the H on the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs on the left and two on the right. But since each coupling is with two Hs, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9, leading to a triplet of triplets. But that's option B.

Wait, but I think that's incorrect because in reality, if a proton is adjacent to two sets of two equivalent protons, it would couple with each set, leading to a triplet for each, and the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

But in the structure O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO, the middle CH2's Hs would be adjacent to two Hs on each side. So, each H on the middle CH2 would split into (2+1) and another (2+1), leading to a triplet of triplets.

So, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

But wait, I'm getting confused between the splitting due to adjacent groups. Let me think again. Each H on the middle CH2 is adjacent to two Hs on the left and two on the right. So, each H would have two coupling partners: the two on the left and the two on the right.

Each coupling would split the peak into a triplet for each. So, the overall splitting would be (2+1) * (2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a triplet of triplets. So, option B.

Wait, but sometimes in such cases, if the two adjacent groups are equivalent, the splitting can be simplified. But in this case, the two CH2 groups are not necessarily equivalent because one is closer to the aldehyde group. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetric, then the CH2 groups on both sides would be equivalent, leading to a simpler splitting. But if it's asymmetric, the splitting would be more complex.

But the problem states that the most deshielded H is to be considered. In O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO, the Hs on the middle CH2 are more shielded than the aldehyde Hs. Wait, no, the aldehyde Hs are more deshielded. So, the most deshielded H would be the aldehyde Hs. But in that case, their coupling would be with adjacent Hs.

Wait, but in O=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO, the aldehyde Hs are on the ends. Each aldehyde H is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each aldehyde H would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet for each aldehyde H.

But the problem says to exclude Hs that exchange with deuterated solvent, which would include the aldehyde Hs, perhaps. Wait, the problem statement says, "excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent." Aldehyde Hs are typically not exchanged under normal conditions, but maybe in DMSO-d6, they might. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to -OH protons, which would be exchanged.

So, assuming the aldehyde Hs are present, each would be a triplet. But the question is about the most deshielded H, which would be the aldehyde Hs. So, their coupling would be a triplet.

Thus, the correct answer would be a triplet, option A.

But wait, if each aldehyde H is a triplet, then the answer would be A.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde Hs are not present in the NMR because they're exchanged with D2O. But the question states to exclude Hs that exchange with the solvent, so the aldehyde Hs would be considered.

In that case, each aldehyde H is split by the adjacent CH2 group into a triplet. So, the answer would be A) triplet.

But earlier I thought it might be a triplet of triplets, but that's if the H is in the middle CH2. Since the question is about the most deshielded H, which are the aldehyde Hs, their coupling would be with two Hs, leading to a triplet.

So, the correct answer is A) triplet.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH leads to the elimination of two HBr molecules. This forms a ketone, specifically 1,3-adamantanone, as supported by the IR spectrum showing a strong carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ and the NMR data indicating a deshielded region consistent with a ketone.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**: Heating 1,3-adamantanone with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely induces a rearrangement or elimination reaction, forming an alkene (product 2). This step sets up the molecule for ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis**: Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by a reductive work-up with dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. The ozonolysis of an alkene typically produces carbonyl compounds (aldehydes or ketones) depending on the substitution pattern of the double bond.

4. **Analysis of Product 3**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. If product 2 is a simple alkene like 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would yield two aldehyde groups, resulting in a structure like O=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CHO. The hydrogens on the CH₂ groups adjacent to the aldehyde groups would couple with the two hydrogens on the neighboring CH₂ group, leading to a triplet splitting pattern.

5. **Coupling Pattern**: The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3, being on a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, would couple with the two equivalent hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group. This results in a triplet splitting pattern.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
