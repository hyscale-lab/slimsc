Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about a light beam propagating through glass, and the glass itself is moving. The glass has an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given, and the speed of light in a vacuum c is taken as 1.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially with light, it's all about how different reference frames perceive things. Oh right, because of relativity, things aren't as straightforward as just adding velocities.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, and the light is inside it. But wait, in the glass, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction slows down the speed of light. So normally, in the glass's rest frame, the light speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed in the lab?

I think this is related to the addition of velocities in special relativity. The formula for adding velocities when moving from one frame to another is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's for objects moving at speeds much less than c. But in this case, the speed of light in the glass is c/n, which is less than c, so u would be c/n, and the glass's speed is v.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this right. In the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is u' = c/n. So when we transform to the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v in the lab), the speed of light in the lab should be calculated using the velocity addition formula.

So the velocity u in the lab frame would be (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c² ). But since c is taken as 1, that becomes (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

Wait, but u' is the speed in the glass's frame. So u' = c/n = 1/n, since c=1.

So substituting, we get u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Hmm, let me make that clearer. Let me factor out 1/n from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: (1/n) + v = (1 + n v)/n

Denominator: 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n

So when I divide numerator by denominator, (1 + n v)/n divided by (n + v)/n is equal to (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Wait, that's interesting. So the speed of light in the lab frame is (1 + n v)/(n + v).

But wait, looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v), and option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v). Hmm. So according to my calculation, the answer should be option A.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me think about possible mistakes. Did I apply the velocity addition formula correctly?

The velocity addition formula in relativity is u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c=1, it's (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

In this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass's frame, which is 1/n. So substituting, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiplying numerator and denominator by n to simplify:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n + v

So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v) → matches option A.

But wait, another approach: sometimes when frames are moving, you can imagine how the light's speed is observed. But in any inertial frame, the speed of light is always c (assuming c is the speed in vacuum). But wait, that's only in vacuum. Because in this case, the light is inside the glass, which has a refractive index n. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, but the light's speed in the glass would be 1/n, not c.

Wait, no. Wait, that's a crucial point. Because the glass is moving, the speed of light inside it is 1/n as measured in the glass's frame. But when you add the glass's velocity, do you get the speed in the lab?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the lab frame. In the lab, the glass is moving at velocity v. The light inside the glass has a speed of 1/n in the glass's frame, so in the lab frame, it's (1/n + v)/(1 + (1/n)(v)).

Wait, which is the same as before, leading to (1 + n v)/(n + v).

So the answer should be option A.

But let me think about whether the direction makes a difference. The glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light. Wait, no. The problem says: the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's velocity, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well, since the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction as the glass's movement.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up directions. Let me clarify: the glass is moving in the direction of the beam, and toward the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer too, and the beam is in the direction of the glass's movement. So as the glass moves towards the observer, the beam inside it would have a speed relative to the lab that's a combination of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity within the glass.

But regardless, the velocity addition formula should handle it. Let me make sure I didn't mix up signs. Because in relativity, the sign of v matters. In the formula, v is the velocity of the frame S' (glass) relative to frame S (lab). If the glass is moving towards the observer (lab frame), then from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving at velocity v. So when we apply the velocity addition, the formula is correct as I used it.

Wait, but in the standard velocity addition formula, if the frame S' (glass) is moving at speed v relative to S (lab), then to find u (the speed in lab) given u' (the speed in S'), you use u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c²).

In this case, u' is the speed of the light in the glass, which is 1/n. So substituting, u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v) = (1 + n v) / (n + v), which is option A.

But wait, another thought: the refractive index n is related to the speed of light inside the medium. So the speed of light in the medium is v_medium = c/n. But when the medium is moving, the question is about the speed of the light in the lab frame.

So I think my initial approach is correct, leading to option A.

Alternatively, let me think about the case where v is zero. If the glass isn't moving, then the speed in the lab should be 1/n. Plugging v=0 into option A gives (1 + 0)/(n + 0) = 1/n. That's correct. Similarly, if n is 1 (vacuum), then the speed would be (1 + v)/(1 + v) = 1, which is correct because in vacuum, light's speed is always c=1 regardless of the medium's motion. So that makes sense.

Another check: if the glass is moving at a high velocity, say v approaches 1 (since c=1). Then what happens? Let's see:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v). Suppose n is 2, and v is 0.8.

(1 + 2*0.8)/(2 + 0.8) = (1.6 +1)/2.8 = 2.6/2.8 ≈ 0.9286.

In the lab frame, the speed of light should approach c=1 when v is high. Wait, but wait, that's only in vacuum. Because here, the medium is moving, but the light is inside that medium.

Wait, maybe another way: in the limit where v is very small compared to c (non-relativistic speeds), perhaps the Galilean addition applies, but with the speed adjusted for the medium.

Wait, in Galilean terms, the speed would be u' + v, but since u' is 1/n, the speed would be 1/n + v. But that would only be correct if v is non-relativistic, but the problem here uses the relativistic formula.

Wait, in the case when v is small, the denominator (1 + (1/n)v) approximates to 1, so u ≈ 1/n + v. But that's the Galilean addition. So if the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab would be 1/n plus the medium's speed.

Hmm, but that's only for small velocities. In any case, I think the calculation I did earlier is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The glass is moving at velocity \(v\) relative to the lab frame, and the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame) is \(u' = \frac{1}{n}\), where \(n\) is the refractive index of the glass. The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \(c = 1\), this simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Substituting \(u' = \frac{1}{n}\), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \(n\):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. To verify, consider the following:

1. **When \(v = 0\):** The glass is stationary, and the speed of light in the lab frame is \(\frac{1}{n}\), which matches the result when \(v = 0\) in the formula.

2. **When \(n = 1\) (vacuum):** The speed of light should always be \(1\) in the lab frame. Substituting \(n = 1\), the formula gives:

\[
u = \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1
\]

This is consistent with the speed of light in a vacuum.

3. **When \(v\) is small:** For non-relativistic speeds, the formula reduces to \(u \approx \frac{1}{n} + v\), which aligns with Galilean addition for small velocities.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
