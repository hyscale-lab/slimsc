Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, wait, "uniformly distributed" here probably means that their density is uniform, right? Like, the same number of stars per unit volume everywhere. So not clumped in any particular way.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So, they want the relationship between the number of stars in a certain range of parallax and the parallax itself.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/distance. So, if I think about it, a larger parallax means a closer star.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, maybe I should model this with some math. Let's consider a thin shell of stars at a particular distance. The number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume of the shell, I think.

Volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πR² * dR, where R is the radius (distance), and dR is the thickness. Since the density is uniform, the number of stars in that shell would be density multiplied by the volume. So N = density * 4π R² dR.

But parallax plx is 1/R. So, R = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in. Then N = density * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dR. But dR is the change in radius, which can be written in terms of parallax. Since R = 1/plx, dR = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because as plx increases, R decreases. So, the minus sign indicates that as plx increases, R decreases.

But I'm interested in the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for a small change dplx, how many stars are there? Let me rearrange the terms to express this in terms of plx.

Let me write dR as -(1/plx²) dplx. So substituting back into N, which is for a shell between R and R + dR, which corresponds to a parallax from plx to plx + dplx.

Wait, let me think again. If R = 1/plx, then dR is the derivative of R with respect to plx times dplx. dR/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So dR = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Now, substituting into N: N = density * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² dplx). Wait, but the negative sign suggests that as plx increases, R decreases. But since I'm considering a positive change in plx, the shell thickness would be negative, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I should take the absolute value. So, the number of stars per unit plx would be N/(dplx) = density * 4π (1/plx^2) [since (1/plx)^2 is 1/plx²], but wait, let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, N is the number of stars in a thin shell at distance R (which is 1/plx), so N = density * 4π R² dR. But dR is related to dplx. So, dR = (dR/dplx) dplx. dR/dplx is the derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So, dR/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So dR = - dplx/(plx^2).

But when you take the absolute value, because the shell's thickness is a positive quantity, so the number of stars would be N = density * 4π R² * |dR|.

So, substituting R = 1/plx, R² = 1/(plx^2). And |dR| = (dplx)/(plx^2).

So N = density * 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx/plx^2) ) ?

Wait, that would be N = density *4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx/plx^2) ) = density *4π (dplx)/(plx^4) )

But wait, that would make the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) equal to density *4π (1/plx^4). Is that correct?

Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the number of stars in a range of parallax between plx and plx + dplx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume dV is density * dV.

But dV can be expressed in terms of distance. Let me think in terms of spherical shells, where each shell has a radius R and thickness dR. So, the volume of the shell is 4π R² dR.

But R is 1/plx, so dR = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dR) = 4π (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2) dplx.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the signs. Let me approach this more carefully.

The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is proportional to the volume in that shell. The volume of a thin shell is 4π R² dR, where R is the radius.

But R is 1/plx, so dR = (dR/dplx) dplx = (-1/plx²) dplx. So, dR = -dplx/(plx^2).

So, dV = 4π R² dR = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx)/(plx^2) )

The negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, R decreases, but the actual volume is positive. So, the absolute value would be 4π (1/plx^2) * (dplx/(plx^2)) ), which is 4π dplx / plx^4.

So, the number of stars in that volume element is density * dV, which is density * 4π dplx / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dN/dplx) would be (density *4π ) / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is asking how the number of stars per unit plx range changes with plx. So, it's proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's option A: ~1/plx^4.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake because I'm considering the number in a shell, but perhaps the question is considering a differential, so the number per unit plx would be dN = (density * 4π) / plx^4 * dplx. So, dN/dplx = (4π density)/plx^4.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it in terms of flux or distances.

Alternatively, since the number density is uniform, the number of stars in a small volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number per unit volume.

dV can be expressed in terms of distance and parallax. So, for a given parallax plx, the distance R is 1/plx. The volume at that distance is 4π R² dR.

But dR = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So, dR is negative, but the volume is positive, so dV = 4π R² |dR| = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

So, number of stars in that range is n * (4π dplx / plx^4 )

So the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) is (4π n ) / plx^4.

So as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

But wait, wait a second. I'm getting 1/plx^4, but the options include that as option A.

Wait another way: let me think about how the number of stars in a certain volume (at a certain distance) changes with distance or parallax.

The number of stars per unit volume is n, so the number in a shell of thickness dR is n * 4π R² dR.

But R is 1/plx, so substituting R gives:

n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/(plx^2)) )

Again, the negative is just direction, so the number is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) ) dplx = 1/plx^4 dplx.

So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that would be option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that in some cases, the number of stars per unit parallax (or per parsec) decreases with the square of the distance. Maybe I should think about the surface area.

Wait, another approach: The number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the volume. The volume between R and R + dR is 4π R² dR.

But since R = 1/plx, dR = - (1/plx^2) dplx. So, dR is negative, but the volume is positive. So, the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx) = 4π dplx/(plx^4).

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4 per unit plx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of plx is inversely proportional to plx^4.

So option A is correct.

But wait, another thought: when I'm integrating over a range of parallax, the number of stars in a slice of parallax dplx would be density multiplied by the volume element in that slice.

Wait, no, because the volume element isn't a slice of fixed plx, it's a shell at a particular R. So, it's more accurate that the number of stars per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

So, looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by considering the uniform distribution of stars in the sky. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at a distance \( R \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi R^2 \, dR \), where \( dR \) is the thickness of the shell. Since the density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in the shell is given by:

\[
N = \text{density} \cdot 4\pi R^2 \, dR
\]

Parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( R \), i.e., \( R = 1/\text{plx} \). Substituting \( R = 1/\text{plx} \) into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = \text{density} \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \, dR
\]

The thickness of the shell in terms of parallax is related to \( dR \) by \( dR = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} \). Substituting this into the expression for \( N \), we find:

\[
N = \text{density} \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}\right)
\]

Taking the absolute value to ensure positivity, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = \text{density} \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( 1/\text{plx}^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
