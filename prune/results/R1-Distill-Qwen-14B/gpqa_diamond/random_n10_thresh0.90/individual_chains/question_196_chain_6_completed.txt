Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring that's obeying Hooke's law. But wait, it's relativistic, so we can't just use the classical equations anymore. Oh right, in relativity, momentum and energy are different because of the gamma factor. 

So, the system is a 1D oscillator, mass m, maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. I remember that in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy (1/2)mv². Setting them equal, v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, the question is relativistic, so option C might not be the right answer here.

In relativity, energy considerations change because the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of the oscillator is quantized in quanta, but perhaps here we're considering the classical case, so the energy approaches are more about the total energy at different points in the oscillation.

Wait, maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic. But relativistically, the total energy E is gamma mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy would be E - mc², which is (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, but for the maximum speed, the oscillator's potential energy would reach a maximum at x = A, and zero kinetic energy. So the total energy at x=A is purely potential. Then at the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus the rest mass energy. Hmm, but in the relativistic case, the total energy would be the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy.

Wait, no, because in the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, when the amplitude is large enough that relativistic effects are significant, the total energy would be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to set the total energy equal to the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement.

So let me outline the steps:

1. The potential energy at maximum displacement x=A is U = (1/2)kA².

2. The total energy E of the system is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the potential energy at maximum displacement. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, but wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is just (1/2)kA², but relativistically, the rest energy must be considered as part of the total energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), all of this E_total would be kinetic energy. But relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

So setting them equal: (gamma - 1) mc² = E_total - mc²?

Wait, no, wait. E_total should be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Let me think again.

At x=A, the oscillator is at rest momentarily. So all the energy is potential: E = (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, is the potential energy just (1/2)kA², or does it get modified? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kA² because it's from Hooke's law and not from a relativistic spring.

But then the total energy would be the sum of rest energy and potential energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the energy is all kinetic. So the kinetic energy is E_total - mc² = (1/2)kA².

But relativistic kinetic energy is K = (gamma -1) mc².

So setting (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so let me write that equation:

(gamma - 1) = (k A²)/(2 mc²)

Wait, solving for gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc²)

Then gamma = [2 mc² + k A²]/(2 mc²) ?

Wait, no, that's not the right way to represent it. Let me write:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

So gamma is greater than 1 because k, A, m are positive.

Then, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so set that equal:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 mc² )

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable, say, Q. So Q = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Then, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + Q

We can solve for v.

Take reciprocal of both sides: sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + Q)

Square both sides: 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + Q)^2

Then, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+Q)^2 ]

So v² = c² [1 - 1/(1+Q)^2 ]

We can write that as v = c sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + Q)^2 ] )

But let's compute [1/(1 + Q)^2 ]: 

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 + Q)^2 as 1/(1 + Q)^2, so v^2 is c² times [1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 ].

Hmm, let's compute 1 - 1/(1+Q)^2:

1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 = [ (1 + Q)^2 -1 ] / (1 + Q)^2 

= (1 + 2Q + Q² -1 ) / (1 + Q)^2 

= (2Q + Q²) / (1 + Q)^2 

Since Q is (k A²)/(2 m c² ), which is probably small unless the amplitude is very large or k is very high.

But in any case, that's the expression.

So v = c * sqrt( (2Q + Q²) ) / (1 + Q)

Wait, let me see: numerator is sqrt( (2Q + Q²) ), denominator is (1 + Q)?

Wait, no, wait. The expression v^2 is c² multiplied by [ (2Q + Q²) / (1 + Q)^2 ].

So v = c * sqrt( (2Q + Q²) ) / (1 + Q )

Hmm, but perhaps we can factor this expression a bit more.

Wait, sqrt(2Q + Q²) is sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ). Hmm, not sure that helps. Alternatively, factor Q from numerator and denominator:

= c * sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

But perhaps I can rearrange the terms:

v² = c² [ (2Q + Q²) ] / (1 + Q)^2 

But 2Q + Q² = Q (2 + Q) = Q ( (1 + Q) + 1 )

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can write 2Q + Q² as Q (Q + 2) = Q (Q +2), but that might not directly help.

Alternatively, let me expand the denominator (1 + Q)^2 = 1 + 2Q + Q².

So numerator is 2Q + Q², denominator is (1 + 2Q + Q² )

Hmm, maybe that's as simplified as it gets. 

So putting it all back in terms of the original variables:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Let me factor out the (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) terms.

Let me denote Q = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v = c * sqrt( [ Q (2 + Q) ] / (1 + Q)^2 )

= c * sqrt( Q (2 + Q) ) / (1 + Q )

= c * sqrt( [ Q (2 + Q) ] ) / (1 + Q )

Hmm, maybe I can factor this differently.

Wait, perhaps I can write (2 + Q) as (1 + Q) +1, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps factor Q as (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) and re-express:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * (k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) + 2) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

But perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me think about the answer options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - kA²/(2m))² )

Wait, let me compute 1 - kA²/(2m). Hmm, but in our expression, the denominator is (1 + Q ) where Q is (kA²)/(2 m c² ). So that's different.

Option B: v = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, 1/(1 - something) inside the sqrt. Hmm.

Option D: v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let's see. Because our expression for v^2 is c² [1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 ]

So v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + Q)^2 )

Which is similar to option D, which is v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, because Q is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So option D is exactly that.

Wait, but earlier I thought the expression was v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + Q )^2 ), which matches option D.

So the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me recheck the steps, because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, in the beginning, I said E_total is mc^2 + (1/2 k A^2 ), and at x=0, the energy is all kinetic, which is (gamma -1) mc^2. So setting (gamma - 1) mc^2 = (1/2) k A^2.

Which leads to gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, but that's only if the potential energy is (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in the relativistic scenario, is the potential energy still (1/2)kA²? That's a point I'm not entirely sure about. Because in relativity, the energy stored in the spring might be different.

Wait, but the problem states that the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -k x. So the potential energy is the integral of F dx, which would be (1/2)k x², just like in the non-relativistic case. So that part should be correct.

So proceeding under that assumption, the earlier steps are correct.

So, putting it all together, the maximum speed v is c multiplied by the square root of [1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ]

Which is option D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system relativistically. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Total Energy of the System**:  
   At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the oscillator is momentarily at rest, and all the energy is potential. The potential energy is given by \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy (\( mc^2 \)) and the potential energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

2. **Kinetic Energy at Equilibrium**:  
   At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic. Relativistically, the kinetic energy is given by:  
   \[
   K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At equilibrium, \( K = E_{\text{total}} - mc^2 \), so:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Let \( Q = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + Q.
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + Q)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + Q)^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( Q = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching with the Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
