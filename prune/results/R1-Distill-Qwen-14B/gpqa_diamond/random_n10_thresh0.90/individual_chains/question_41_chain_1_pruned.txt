Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with light moving through a medium, the speed depends on the medium's refractive index. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, right? So normally, without any motion, the speed would be v_light = c/n. Since c is given as 1 here, the speed would be 1/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So this is a case where there's a medium in motion relative to the observer. I think I need to apply some sort of velocity addition here, maybe from special relativity? Or is it just a classical addition?

Let me think. In special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula for adding velocities is different. Oh right, the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). But wait, in this case, the light is in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, so from the lab frame, the beam's speed could be affected by the glass's motion.

Wait no, wait. The light is moving through the glass, but the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light in the glass?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this carefully.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. Because when a medium is at rest, the light's speed within it is c/n.

But the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So from the lab's perspective, what is the speed of the light?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so perhaps the light's speed is not just v_light + v? Because that would be the classical approach. But according to relativity, we can't just add velocities like that when they're comparable to c. However, in this problem, since the speed of the glass is v, and c is 1, but unless v is a significant fraction of c, maybe we can approximate it classically.

Wait, but the problem says 'glass is moving at constant velocity v', so perhaps we should consider relativistic effects. Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light in the glass in the lab frame is still c/n, because the speed of light is invariant in relativity. Wait, no, that's the speed in vacuum, but in a medium it's different. Oh, right, in special relativity, the speed of light in a medium isn't c. So that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think. The problem is about the speed of light in the glass as seen by the lab observer. So the glass is moving, and the light is moving through it.

Wait, but the glass's movement might affect the light's speed in the lab frame. So in the glass's rest frame, light moves at c/n. So from the lab frame, moving with velocity v relative to the glass, how do we find the speed of the light?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the velocity addition formula. Let me clarify the frames.

In the glass's rest frame (S'), the light is moving at u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity (since the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass is moving, toward the observer). Wait, wait, the glass is moving towards the observer in the lab frame, and the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's movement. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction, so in the lab frame, the light would be moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at
