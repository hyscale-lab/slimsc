Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, first, let me make sure I understand the setup. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward.

So when we mix the acetic acid with water, that's diluting it. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're adding the same volume of water, so the new concentration after dilution can be calculated. Since volume doubles, concentration halves. So 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M?

Wait, wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, no, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration is half. So yes, the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

But wait, let me calculate it properly. The initial moles of acetic acid would be volume (in liters) multiplied by concentration. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Then, when you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, during titration with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid present. So let's figure out how much NaOH is needed at equivalence.

We have 0.001 mol of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and equivalence. So for 25% titration, that's 25% of the equivalence volume, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "at 25% titration", so that's 25% of the equivalence point volume. So at 25% titration, only 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So we can calculate the moles of NaOH added at that point.

Alternatively, another approach is to first calculate the initial solution after dilution, then find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me approach each part step by step.

First, the diluted acetic acid solution:

Concentration: 0.025 M. Volume is 40 cm³.

At equivalence point:
We add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

But let's think about the solution at equivalence. When all the acetic acid is neutralized, we end up with the sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so the solution will be basic.

The sodium acetate will dissociate completely in water: CH3COO^- Na+ → CH3COO^- + Na+. The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit ahead of myself. Let's proceed.

At equivalence point:

We have 0.001 mol of NaOH added, which neutralizes 0.001 mol of acetic acid, producing 0.001 mol of acetate ion. The total volume of solution is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, to find the pH, we can use the Kb expression.

For acetate ion, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] 

Assuming x is the concentration of OH- produced, we can write:

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02, since Kb is very small.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.288e-6 M. Then pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.485. So pH = 14 - 5.485 ≈ 8.515.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A says 8.52 as the equivalence point, which matches closely with this value. But wait, wait, let me check the calculations again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should have considered more precise Kb. Let me re-calculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.54054e-9 → 5.4054e-10, which is correct.

Then, Kb = 5.4054e-10.

So x^2 = (5.4054e-10) * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11. Square root is about 3.288e-6, as before.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517. So 3.288e-6 is 1e-5 * 3.288. So log is 5.485 (since log(3.288e-6) = log(3.288) + log(1e-6) ≈ 0.517 -6 → -5.483, so pOH is 5.483, pH is 14 -5.483 = 8.517. So approximately 8.52. So at equivalence, pH is about 8.52. That's option A's second value. But let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options:
A) 4.26; 8.52
B) 3.17; 6.73
C) 4.73;7.00
D)4.57;6.92

So the equivalence point is either around 8.5 or lower, depending on the solution.

Wait, but wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the pH of a salt solution:

pH = 1/2 (pKa + pKb), but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no. Wait, no, that's the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is used when you have a buffer, like at a certain point before equivalence.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. For a solution of the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, the pH can be calculated using the Kb of the conjugate base.

So yes, acetate has Kb = 5.405e-10. So let's proceed.

Another way: The concentration is 0.02 M acetate. So the hydrolysis reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] 

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, and x is small, so [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ (x^2) / 0.02 → x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → as before.

So x = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 → pOH = 5.483 → pH = 8.517, which rounds to 8.52. So the equivalence point pH is about 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Now, what about the pH at 25% titration? So that's 25% of the way to the equivalence point.

Wait, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added, as earlier calculated. So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

So the moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001 mol. So after adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, the moles reacted are 0.00025 mol. So remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate produced are 0.00025 mol.

The total volume now is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.735 (since log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 4.733).

So pH = 4.735 + log( (0.005882) / (0.017647) )

Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258, which is approximately 4.26.

So the pH at 25% titration is around 4.26, and at equivalence it's around 8.52. So looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52.

Wait,
