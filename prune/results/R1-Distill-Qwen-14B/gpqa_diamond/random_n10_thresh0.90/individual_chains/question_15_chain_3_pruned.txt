Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets have the same minimum mass, but their orbital periods and host stars are different. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. But wait, the planets are Earth-like, so their sizes are similar. Oh, but the question says they have the same masses, but that doesn't directly relate to their radii. Hmm, but wait, the host stars have the same radii. So, the star size is the same for both. That might simplify things.

Wait, no, the host stars have the same radii. So for transit probability, which depends on the ratio of planet radius to star radius, but if the planets are Earth-like, their radii might be similar. But since the problem statement doesn't give their individual radii, perhaps I can assume they're the same. Or maybe it's not necessary because the probability formula involves the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, no, the transit probability formula I remember is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else. Or wait, actually, the probability of a transit is approximately (R_p / a)², where a is the semi-major axis. Or maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² times another factor, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I think the transit probability for a planet is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 - e^2)^-0.5, but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just (R_p / R_s)^2. But in this case, both stars have the same radii, R_s. So if the planets have the same radius, the probability would be the same? That can't be right because the options suggest different probabilities.

Wait, no, maybe I got the formula wrong. Another thought: the geometric probability of a transit is (R_p / a)², where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

I recall that the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 divided by ( (a_p / R_s) )^2 ), but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the probability is the area of the planet's disk over the area of
