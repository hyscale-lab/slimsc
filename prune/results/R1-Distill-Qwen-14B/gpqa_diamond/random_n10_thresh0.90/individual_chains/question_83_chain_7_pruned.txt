Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. When you titrate a weak acid with a strong base like NaOH, the reaction is usually a neutralization where the acid reacts with the base to form its conjugate base.

First, I think I need to calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The concentration should change because of dilution.

Wait, the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. Dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Let's plug in the numbers.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let's calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but no, wait. Wait, the original solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So yeah, the concentration halves, so 0.025 M. That makes sense.

Now, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume added at 25% titration would be 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to find the equivalence point volume first.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: volume in liters is 0.04 L, concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So NaOH needs 0.001 mol as well.

NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So at 25% titration, NaOH added is 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So that's 2.5 mL.

Now, the pH at 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the solution is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate.

At 25% titration, the moles of NaOH added is 25% of 0.001 mol, which is 0.00025 mol. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH adds a mole of acetate.

So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. Moles of acetate formed: 0.00025 mol. Remaining acetic acid: 0.00075 mol.

The total volume at this point is initial solution (40 cm³) plus NaOH added (2.5 cm³) → 42.5 cm³. Wait, but wait, when you mix two solutions, the volumes add. So 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's compute that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 is (0.75e-3) / (4.25e-2) = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 /
