Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product based on the given IR and NMR data. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I should understand what reaction occurs when a compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. From what I remember, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Wait, or is it for elimination? No, wait, I think when you have a compound with a leaving group like a bromide or chloride attached to an aromatic ring, red phosphorus and HI can cause a substitution reaction, maybe a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Alternatively, I think when you have allylic or benzylic halides, treating with red phosphorus and HI can lead to elimination, forming alkenes. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Or maybe it's more about cleavage of certain bonds.

Wait, another thought: if the compound has an ester group, like RCOOR', then treatment with HI might cause hydrolysis. But red phosphorus is often used with HI for the cleavage of certain protecting groups, like the trityl group, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the conversion of alkenes to diols via the hydroxylation reaction. But that's probably not the case here because the product options don't seem to involve diols.

Alternatively, if the compound has a benzylic halide, like a benzyl bromide, then reacting with HI and red phosphorus might cause elimination, forming a double bond. But I'm not entirely sure on that.

Wait, another possibility: I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction for removing carbonyl groups. Wait no, Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine and then heat with something like KOH and NH3, not red phosphorus and HI.

Alternatively, maybe the compound has a nitrile group. Red phosphorus with HI can be used to reduce nitriles to alkanes. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of elimination, like the formation of an alkene. For example, if the compound has a vicinal dihalide, treating with HI would cause elimination, forming an alkene. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the IR and NMR data to figure out what the starting compound is, and then determine how it reacts.

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretch or maybe an amine. But 3400-2500 is a broad range, so maybe it's an O-H in a carbonyl compound, like a carboxylic acid or an ester. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol. Wait, but the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O), which suggests maybe a carboxylic acid, ester, ketone, or amide. Then, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an -OH proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because that's the typical region for a carboxylic acid proton. The fact that it's a broad singlet suggests it's not exchanging quickly, but in D2O, it would disappear. Wait, but sometimes in DMSO it's broad. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm. But 10.5 is more towards a carboxylic acid.

Wait, wait, another thought: if there's an aromatic ring with substituents, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an acidic proton, perhaps a phenol. But phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm or so, unless it's a para-substituted phenol with strong electron-withdrawing groups, which can deshield the proton, making it upfield. Wait no, that's not right. Electron-withdrawing groups para would deactivate the ring, but phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm. Hmm, maybe not. So 10.5 is more likely a COOH proton.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical of a para-substituted aromatic ring. So maybe a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, one being something that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. Like a para-disubstituted benzene, perhaps a -COOH group in the para position with another substituent.

Wait, but looking at the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): each is a doublet, so two protons each, which suggests a substituent causing splitting. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with an electron-withdrawing group like -COOH, the ring protons would be split into two doublets. So the two protons on one side of the substituent would be one doublet, and the two on the other side another doublet.

So if the substituent is a -COOR (ester) or -COOH (carboxylic acid), then the ring would have two doublets. But wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester (COOR) carbonyl or a ketone or aldehyde. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, but a carboxylic acid usually also has a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, which is in the 3400â€“2500 range. So that fits. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 which is a singlet, so perhaps a carboxylic acid. So the structure might be a para-substituted benzoic acid with another substituent.

Looking at the other NMR peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a multiplet, maybe a methylene or a CH group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Like maybe a CH adjacent to the carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to a CH or another group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a triplet of three protons, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH2 or something, perhaps part of an isopropyl group. Wait, a doublet (d) suggests it's attached to something that splits it into two peaks. So maybe it's a methyl group attached to a CH, which is split into a doublet by neighboring protons. Or perhaps it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a triplet, which is typical of a terminal methyl group in a chain. Like a CH2CH2CH3 group. So that would be a -CH2CH2CH3, maybe attached to something else.

Putting this together, perhaps the compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a chain leading to a terminal methyl group.

Wait, let's try to build the structure. The aromatic ring has a -COOH group and perhaps another substituent. The other substituent could be a side chain leading to a methyl group. Let's see.

Looking at the NMR, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH3 group attached via an oxygen, but no, because that would be more like an ether. Alternatively, it's a side chain attached to the ring.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group attached to the ring, maybe. Let's try to imagine:

The benzoic acid is at position 1 (para), and perhaps a substituent like -(CH2)2CH(CH3)2? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe a propyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH3 group attached to the ring. But then, looking at the NMR, the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet, which would be the central CH in a propyl chain. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: look for the integration. The 10.5 is 1H, which suggests a single proton, like the -COOH. The 8.0 and 7.2 each are 2H, so two protons each, which fits the para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing two protons each. Wait, no: a para-substituted benzene has two substituents opposite each other, leading to two sets of two protons each. So, for example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 would cause that splitting? Wait, no, wait. Let's think: a para-substituted benzene would have substituents at positions 1 and 4, leading to the ring protons at positions 2,3,5,6. Those would split into two doublets, each with two protons, which matches the NMR.

So the ring has two substituents in para positions. One is the -COOH group, and the other is another group. Let me think: the substituent could be a -CH2CH2CH3 group or something similar.

Wait, the NMR has the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) and 0.9 ppm (t,3H) which suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring.

But wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which suggests it's attached to a CH group. Like in an isopropyl group? Wait, wait: in an isopropyl group, the two CH3 groups are attached to a central CH. The CH3 groups would appear as septets (split by the neighboring CH3), but here, we have a doublet for 3H, which suggests that each of those Hs is coupled to one other set of Hs. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think about the substituent structure. The
