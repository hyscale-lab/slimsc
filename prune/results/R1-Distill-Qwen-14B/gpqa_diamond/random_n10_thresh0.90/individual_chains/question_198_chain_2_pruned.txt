Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think are the ones with two SCN- ligands, Co(SCN)_2^2+ maybe.

Hmm, wait, the problem refers to dithiocyanato, so that's two SCN- per Co^2+ ion. So the complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^(2-n) where n is the number of ligands. The stability constants are given as β1 to β4, which I think correspond to the complexes with 1, 2, 3, and 4 SCN- ligands respectively. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], and so on.

The stability constant, β, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So for each complex, the formation step would be:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} with β_n = [complex]/([Co^2+ ][SCN^-]^n)

The problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which I believe are the [Co(SCN)_2]^(0) species. Wait, no, wait. For Co^2+ and SCN-, each SCN- is -1 charge. So for each SCN- adsorbed, the charge decreases by one. So Co^2+ with two SCN- would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral. But sometimes, the complexes might have varying charges. Hmm, but maybe I don't need to worry about that for this problem.

The main idea is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the form of the dithiocyanato complex. The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ions.

So the approach would be:

1. Write the expressions for each complex in terms of β.
2. Assume that the concentration of free Co^2+ is x.
3. Express each complex's concentration in terms of x and the β values.
4. Sum all the concentrations (including free Co^2+) and set the sum equal to the total cobalt concentration, which is 1e-2 M.
5. Solve for x.
6. Then calculate the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2], and find its percentage.

Wait, but wait—each β is given, but we have to consider the formation of each complex step by step. For example, to form [Co(SCN)_2], the process is sequential:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1)
[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2] (β2, but wait, what's the relation here?)

Wait, I think the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs. Or maybe each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So β1 is for the first step, [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 would be for the second step, so the overall for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1 * β2, right?

Wait no, I think I'm confusing β here. If βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands, then for each complex:

β1 = K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )

Wait, no, that can't be, because each subsequent β would be for adding another ligand. So β2 is the second formation constant. So the overall β for the second complex is K1 * K2, where K1 is β1, and K2 is β2. So [Co(SCN)_2] = [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 * (β1 * β2) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. Stability constants are typically defined stepwise. So the first step is Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^+ with K = β1. The second step is [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_2] with K = β2. So the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2.

Similarly, the third step would be [Co(SCN)_2] + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_3]^- with K = β3, making the overall β for [Co(SCN)_3] equal to β1 * β2 * β3. And the fourth step would be [Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} with K = β4, so overall β4_total = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, but the problem lists β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is the stepwise constant for the nth ligand. Therefore, the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step.

So for each complex:

β1 = K1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) → [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

β2 = K2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / ( [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-] ) → [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co(SCN)]^+ [SCN^-]

Substituting [Co(SCN)]^+ from β1:

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * (β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]) ) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] would be β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3, and [Co(SCN)_4] is β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

Wait, but that might not be right. Let me think again: the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the stepwise β's up to the nth step.

So for [Co(SCN)_n], the overall β is β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, but in the problem, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each complex, the overall β would be the product up to that n. So:

β1 = 9 → for [Co(SCN)]^+.

β1*β2 = 9*40 = 360 → for [Co(SCN)_2].

β1*β2*β3 = 360 *63 = 22680 → for [Co(SCN)_3].

β1*β2*β3*β4 = 22680 *16 = 362880 → for [Co(SCN)_4].

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the βn is the cumulative product. So each βn is the overall constant up to n ligands. But the way the question is phrased, it says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So perhaps each β is the overall stability constant for each complex. So β1 is the constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

Wait, that would make more sense. So:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] ) → [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 ) → [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2

Similarly,

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 ) → [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 ) → [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Wait, but that can't be right because the stepwise β's are different from the overall ones. Because if each βn is the overall, then for [Co(SCN)_2], β2 would be much larger than β1, because it's the overall product.

But in the given values, β2=40 is larger than β1=9, but β3=63 is larger than β2=40, and β4=16 is smaller than β3=63. So [Co(SCN)_4] would have a lower stability constant than [Co(SCN)_3], which seems odd. That might not make sense, but maybe that's how the data is given.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me proceed under the assumption that each βn is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So [Co(SCN)_n] = βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

If that's the case, then the concentrations of the various complexes can be written in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the complexes plus the free Co^2+.

So total [Co] = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = 1e-2 M.

But wait, the problem says the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all species is 1e-2.

And the [SCN^-] is given as 0.1 M. So I can plug that into the expressions for each complex.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x.

Then:

[Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 * x * (0.1) = 9x *0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 =40 x * 0.01 = 0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * x * (0.1)^3 =63 x * 0.001 = 0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 * x * (0.1)^4 =16 x * 0.0001 = 0.0016 x.

So the total cobalt concentration is:

x + [Co(SCN)]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = total.

Adding those up:

x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x * (2.3646) = 1e-2 M.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.224e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute 1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016:

1 → 1.0

+0.9 →
