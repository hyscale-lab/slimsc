Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. There are two reaction steps, and I need to pick the right reagents (A and B) from the options provided.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

And the options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations for A and B.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to figure out what each step is doing. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The reactant is butan-2-one, which is methylacetone (CH3-CO-CH2-CH3, wait no, wait. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. Then it's reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. So the nitrile group (CN) is on carbon 2, which also has a hydroxyl (OH) and a methyl group. So the structure is CH(CH2CH3)(OH)CN? Or wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, so butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, perhaps the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe I should think in terms of the reaction.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, what happens? I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the nitrile can act as a nucleophile in a ketone. This might be a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

Wait, sodium cyanide (NaCN) is a good nucleophile. So the mechanism would involve the nitrile attacking the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. But wait, in such additions, after the nucleophile attacks, you get an addition product, like a cyanohydrin.

Wait, a cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with CN- as a nucleophile, adding to the carbonyl. The product is a secondary alcohol after protonation, but wait, in the presence of an acid, perhaps?

Wait, but let me think. The reaction between a ketone and NaCN usually requires an acid catalyst. Because the CN- is a weak nucleophile, so the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make it a better electrophile. So the steps would be:

1. Acid (H+) protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.
2. CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a tetrahedral intermediate.
3. The leaving group (the protonated oxygen) leaves, but wait, no, the structure would have the CN added to the carbonyl. Wait, perhaps it's more like the nitrile adds to the carbonyl, forming a new carbon-carbon bond, and then the oxygen becomes O- which picks up a proton.

Wait, but after the attack, the oxygen would have a negative charge, so it would grab a proton from the acid (H3O+), turning back into an alcohol. So the product would have the CN attached to the carbonyl carbon and the OH on the same carbon, making a secondary alcohol.

Wait, so butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. When it reacts with NaCN in presence of acid (like H3O+), the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Let me count the carbons. The original ketone has three carbons. The product would have four? Let me see: the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile?

Wait, wait. Wait, butanenitrile is four carbons, right? So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But with substituents. So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be:

The nitrile is on carbon 2. So the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is CH3-C(OH)(CN
