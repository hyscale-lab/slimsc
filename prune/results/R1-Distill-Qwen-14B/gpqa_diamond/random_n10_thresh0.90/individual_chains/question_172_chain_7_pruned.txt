Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms is related to the temperature. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I think that relates to their ionization or maybe the energy levels they're in.

Wait, the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so Boltzmann distribution applies here. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation describes the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of populations between two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference over (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

So the equation is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE / (k T) )

In this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. I think "excited" here refers to being in a higher energy level. So for star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2's excited state, assuming the same lower state. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. I'm not entirely sure, but probably the ratio is given.

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So if the excited state is n1 and the lower state is n0, then n1/n0 for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Or wait, no. The question says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So (n_upper / n_lower)_1 = 2 * (n_upper / n_lower)_2.

But wait, no. Let me read the question again. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Oh, so maybe the excitation refers to the same energy level relative to the ground state. But wait, the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the energy difference ΔE is the same, because it's the same energy levels we're comparing.

So for star_1, the ratio would be n1/n0 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, it would be n1/n0 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

According to the problem, star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's. So:

n1/n0 (star1) = 2 * (n1/n0 (star2))

Which gives:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm. Let's take natural logs on both sides to simplify.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

=> (-ΔE)/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, because ln(ab) = ln a + ln b. So on the right, it's ln(2) + ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ), which is ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2).

So:

-ΔE/(k
