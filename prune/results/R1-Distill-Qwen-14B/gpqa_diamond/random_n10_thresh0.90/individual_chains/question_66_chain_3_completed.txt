Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that it's a framework where you add higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model to account for beyond the Standard Model physics. But wait, I need to think about the symmetries these operators must respect.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to pick the correct ones.

First, let me think about what each symmetry means. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial frames, so any theory respecting special relativity must have this symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, meaning the theory is invariant under the Poincare group which includes Lorentz transformations, translations, and boosts. Wait, but if a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it automatically respects Lorentz symmetry because Poincare is a bigger symmetry group. So if an operator respects Poincare, it's also Lorentz symmetric.

But the question is about what must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. I remember that SMEFT is built by adding operators that are consistent with the Standard Model's symmetries. The Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, Poincare, and some other discrete symmetries like CPT. Oh, wait, the Standard Model is a Lorentz invariant theory, but does it respect Poincare? Since it's a quantum field theory, it should respect Poincare symmetry because all local QFTs do.

Wait, but in SMEFT, when you add operators, you have to make sure that they maintain the same symmetries as the Standard Model. So any operator you add must have the same symmetry structure as the SM. For example, the operators are classified by their dimension and the representations of the SM fields they transform under. But what about the symmetries like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.?

So, must all SMEFT operators respect Lorentz symmetry? I think yes. Because the SM already is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM as a subset. So any operator added must be a Lorentz scalar, or otherwise, the theory would violate Lorentz symmetry, which is a big no-no in relativity.

What about Poincare symmetry? Well, Poincare includes translations. So the theory must respect momentum conservation, etc. Are all SMEFT operators Poincare-invariant? Hmm. Let me think. The SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it includes all possible terms that are consistent with the SM's symmetries. So if the SM respects Poincare, then the SMEFT must as well. Because adding operators that violate Poincare would affect the theory's validity. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies Lorentz symmetry as a subset.

Wait, but wait. No, wait a minute. The Poincare group includes translations, which implies that the theory is invariant under shifting the spacetime coordinates. That's related to the conservation of energy and momentum. But if the operators are local, like in the Standard Model, then they should respect Poincare. But in effective field theories, sometimes you have non-local terms, but SMEFT is a local effective theory, right? So yes, SMEFT operators should respect Poincare symmetry. Because if they didn't, the theory would not be a valid QFT.

So the first two symmetries, Lorentz and Poincare, both must be respected. But wait, Poincare implies Lorentz. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz, but the converse isn't necessarily true. Wait, no, the other way around. If an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it doesn't necessarily mean it respects Poincare. Because Poincare is a larger symmetry.

Wait no, no. The question is which symmetries must be respected. So if an operator is Poincare symmetric, it must be Lorentz symmetric. If an operator is only Lorentz symmetric, it may not be Poincare symmetric. So when the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators, perhaps both Lorentz and Poincare are required, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the operators. SMEFT operators are higher-dimensional terms, each constructed as a product of SM fields, covariant derivatives, etc. These operators must form scalars under the SM gauge group, but they must also transform as scalars under Lorentz symmetry. Because the theory is Lorentz invariant. So each operator is a Lorentz scalar. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

But what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes translations. So the theory must be invariant under translation, which is related to the fact that the Lagrangian is translation invariant. But each operator in the Lagrangian is a Poincare scalar as well, because the Lagrangian density is a scalar under Poincare. So each term in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. So yes, each operator must respect Poincare symmetry, which in turn requires Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but the question gives options where 1 and 2 are both in the same option, as in option A is 1 and 2. So if the correct answer includes both, then the answer would include Lorentz and Poincare.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about Poincare symmetry. The Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations, spatial and temporal translations, and boosts. The theory must be invariant under all of these. So if a theory respects Poincare, it necessarily respects Lorentz symmetry. But the converse isn't true. So in the SMEFT, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry because the underlying theory is a Poincare-invariant QFT.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So each operator must be a scalar under both Lorentz and Poincare? Or are they automatically scalars under Poincare if they're scalars under Lorentz?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators are required to be Lorentz scalars, but not necessarily Poincare scalars. Wait, but the entire theory must respect Poincare symmetry. That is, the sum of all operators in the Lagrangian must be a Poincare scalar. But individual operators might not be Poincare scalars themselves. Wait, no, because each term in the Lagrangian must transform as a scalar under Poincare. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the Lagrangian is a scalar under Poincare, each term in the Lagrangian (each operator multiplied by a coefficient) must transform as a scalar under Poincare. So each operator must be a Poincare scalar. Because if one term wasn't, then the total Lagrangian wouldn't be a scalar under Poincare.

So that would mean that all SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So both 1 and 2 are correct. But looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2.

Wait, but then the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So the correct answer includes both Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: the Poincare symmetry includes the possibility of translations, which is related to energy and momentum conservation. But each individual operator in the Lagrangian doesn't have to be a scalar under Poincare? No, because the entire Lagrangian must be a scalar. So each term must be a scalar under Poincare.

But how is an operator a scalar under Poincare? Because the Poincare group includes translations, which implies that the operator must be a scalar under spatial and time translations. But operators in the Lagrangian are local, so they depend on fields and their derivatives at a point, which are naturally scalars under translations. So perhaps each operator is a scalar under Poincare.

Wait, maybe I should think that all operators in SMEFT are Poincare scalars. Because the theory as a whole is Poincare-invariant, so each term must transform as a scalar. So, yes, all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

But wait, the question asks which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators. So both 1 and 2.

But then looking at the answer options, option A is 1 and 2. So the answer would be A? But wait, I thought that CPT is also a symmetry that must be respected.

Wait, another point. The Standard Model is a CPT symmetric theory. So any effective theory extending it must also respect CPT symmetry. So any operator added must be CPT invariant.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if the SM is CPT symmetric, then the SMEFT must also be CPT symmetric. So all operators must be CPT invariant.

Wait, so each operator must be a CPT eigenstate. So, for example, if an operator has a certain transformation under C, P, and T, it must combine in such a way that it's invariant under CPT.

But wait, each operator is a scalar under the SM gauge group and Lorentz. But do they have to be CPT scalars? Or can they change under CPT as long as the overall theory is CPT symmetric?

Wait, the theory (the entire SMEFT) must be CPT symmetric because the SM is. So the sum of all terms must be a scalar under CPT. But individual operators can transform as non-scalars under CPT as long as they are accompanied by terms that balance them to maintain CPT symmetry. But in the SMEFT framework, when you add operators, they have to be chosen in a way that maintains the CPT symmetry.

Wait, but in reality, the SMEFT is built by including all possible operators that are consistent with the SM's symmetries, including CPT. So each operator must transform in such a way that the entire theory remains CPT invariant. But does that mean each individual operator must be CPT invariant, or just that the combination of terms must preserve CPT symmetry?

I think it's the latter. For example, in the SM, the Higgs field is not C invariant, but the theory as a whole is CPT invariant because the terms involving the Higgs are accompanied by terms that restore CPT symmetry. So perhaps in SMEFT, individual operators can transform under CPT, but the overall Lagrangian remains CPT invariant.

Wait, but if that's the case, then individual operators don't necessarily have to be CPT scalars. So the operators don't need to respect CPT symmetry themselves. But the entire theory must.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. The question says which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the entire theory must respect CPT, but individual operators can have non-trivial transformations as long as the sum respects CPT, then the operators themselves don't have to individually respect CPT. So the answer may not include 4 (CPT).

But wait, wait. CPT symmetry is a combination of C, P, and T. So the theory must have CPT symmetry. If an operator doesn't respect C, but the other operators compensate for it, then the overall theory might still have CPT. But I'm not too sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each operator must be a scalar under C, P, and T individually, but that's probably not the case. The SM doesn't have all operators being C, P, T scalars.

Wait, for example, the electromagnetic field is a P-odd, but the theory includes other terms that restore P symmetry. So perhaps the individual operators don't need to be CPT scalars.

So, perhaps the operators don't have to respect CPT symmetry themselves, but the theory as a whole must. So the operators don't need to individually respect CPT symmetry.

Similarly, for CP symmetry. The SM isn't CP symmetric in general, but the SMEFT includes operators that may violate CP, but the overall theory's symmetry depends on the combination of terms. So individual operators don't have to respect CP.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the theory (as a whole) must respect Poincare and Lorentz, then each operator must be a scalar under those. But for CPT and CP, the individual operators may not have to be scalars under those symmetries.

Wait, but the question is a bit ambiguous. It says "must be respected by all operators." So if the operators don't have to be individually invariant under CPT, then 4 isn't a required symmetry for each operator.

Wait, but the theory must respect CPT symmetry, so any operator added must not break CPT. But how is that possible? Because if you have an operator that's not CPT invariant, you'd need another operator to make the theory CPT invariant.

Wait, perhaps the SMEFT framework, when adding operators, ensures that the CPT symmetry is maintained. That is, any operator added must be accompanied by others to preserve CPT. But each individual operator in the Lagrangian doesn't need to be CPT invariant on its own.

So, that would mean that the operators don't need to individually respect CPT symmetry, but the theory as a whole does. Therefore, the operators don't have to respect CPT. So the correct answer would not include 4.

Similarly, for CP symmetry. The SM doesn't have CP symmetry, but some extensions, like the MSSM, do. But in general, the SMEFT can have CP-violating operators. So the operators don't need to respect CP individually.

So, putting it all together: which symmetries must be respected by all operators?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes, because each operator must be a Lorentz scalar.

2. Poincare symmetry: Since each operator is a term in the Lagrangian, which must be a scalar under Poincare, so yes.

Wait, but earlier I thought about Poincare including translations. But each operator in the Lagrangian is a local operator, so translation invariance is already satisfied because the Lagrangian is a function of fields and their derivatives. So perhaps each operator is automatically a Poincare scalar as they are written at a point. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare.

Wait, but this may not be right. Because Poincare includes Lorentz transformations and translations. So the operator must transform as a scalar under both. Since Lorentz symmetry is required, and the operator is a scalar under Lorentz, and also under translations (since it's a local operator), perhaps each operator is automatically a Poincare scalar.

So, the operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So, both 1 and 2 are correct.

So, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) 1,2

C)1,2,4

Wait, the options are:

Option A: 1,2

Option C: 1,2,4 (so 1,2 and 4 are correct)

But wait, earlier I thought that the operators don't necessarily respect CPT or CP, but the theory as a whole does. So, the operators don't have to individually respect CPT or CP.

So, the correct symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz and Poincare.

Wait, but the options are:

Option A: 1,2

Option C: 1,2,4

So, if 1 and 2 are correct, then the answer is A. But I thought earlier that the theory must respect CPT, so perhaps operators must respect CPT as well.

Wait, another angle. The standard model is CPT invariant. So any effective theory must also be CPT invariant. So any operator added in SMEFT must transform in a way that preserves CPT symmetry. But how does that work on an operator-by-operator basis?

I think that each operator must have a well-defined CPT transformation. Because if an operator has a certain CPT transformation, you can include its hermitian conjugate to maintain CPT symmetry. So, perhaps each operator must be a CPT scalar. Or perhaps they can have any CPT transformation as long as their Hermitian conjugates are included.

Wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a scalar under CPT but not under C or P individually. So, perhaps in SMEFT, the operators can transform under C, P, T, but when combined with their Hermitian conjugates, the total Lagrangian remains CPT invariant.

So, individual operators don't have to be CPT scalars, but the sum of all terms must be. So, the operators don't need to individually respect CPT symmetry. So, option 4 is not something each operator must respect.

Similarly with CP symmetry (option 3). The theory as a whole may or may not respect CP, but individual operators don't have to.

So, the only symmetries that each operator must respect are Lorentz and Poincare. So, the correct answer would be option A: 1 and 2.

But wait, the option C says 1,2,4. Maybe I was wrong about CPT.

Wait, what's CPT symmetry? It's the combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be CPT symmetric. So, the SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must be CPT symmetric. Therefore, the entire theory must respect CPT symmetry.

But does that mean that each individual operator must be a CPT scalar? Or can they transform non-trivially under CPT as long as the Lagrangian remains a CPT scalar when all terms are considered?

I think it's the latter. The Lagrangian must be a scalar under CPT, which could be achieved by having terms that are CPT eigenstates, possibly including their Hermitian conjugates.

Thus, each operator can transform under CPT as long as the Lagrangian remains CPT invariant. So, individual operators don't have to be CPT scalars themselves.

So, the operators don't have to individually respect CPT symmetry, but the theory as a whole must.

Therefore, the answer would not include option 4.

So, the correct symmetries that each operator must respect are 1 and 2. So, the answer should be option A.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

A) 1,2

C) 1,2,4

So, if my conclusion is that 1 and 2 are correct, then the answer is A.

But wait, I'm a bit uncertain about whether Poincare is needed. Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But I think that since the operators are part of the Lagrangian, which is a scalar under Poincare, each operator must be a Poincare scalar. So yes, 2 is correct.

But then, what about option C? It includes 1,2,4. So if 4 is required, then option C is correct.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again.

The CPT theorem says that any Lorentz-invariant QFT must be CPT symmetric. So, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect CPT. Therefore, the entire theory must be CPT symmetric. But to ensure that, each operator must transform under CPT in a way that when you include all terms, the sum is a CPT scalar.

But each operator doesn't have to be a CPT scalar themselves. For example, you can have an operator that is C-odd, but then you must include its C conjugate to maintain CPT symmetry.

So, the operators themselves don't have to be CPT scalars, but the whole collection must. So, the individual operators don't need to be CPT invariant. Therefore, CPT symmetry is not a symmetry that each operator must respect.

So, back to the conclusion: the correct symmetries are 1 and 2, so option A is correct.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics. These operators must respect the symmetries of the SM, which includes Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The question asks which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

### Key Analysis of Each Symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**:  
   Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime, ensuring that the laws of physics are invariant under Lorentz transformations (rotations, boosts, and frame changes). Since the SM is Lorentz-invariant, any effective theory like SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**:  
   Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. The Lagrangian in any quantum field theory (QFT) must be a scalar under Poincaré transformations to ensure the theory is consistent with special relativity. Since SMEFT is a QFT and extends the SM, all operators in the Lagrangian must respect Poincaré symmetry. This includes being invariant under translations, which is automatically satisfied for local operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**:  
   CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P) symmetries. While the SM is not CP-symmetric in general, SMEFT can include operators that violate CP symmetry. Therefore, individual operators in SMEFT do not need to respect CP symmetry, as the theory as a whole may or may not be CP-symmetric depending on the operators included.

4. **CPT Symmetry**:  
   The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant QFT must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, the entire theory must respect CPT symmetry. However, individual operators do not need to be CPT scalars themselves. Instead, the sum of all terms in the Lagrangian must be CPT-invariant, which can be achieved by including operators and their Hermitian conjugates as needed.

### Conclusion:
- **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **Poincaré symmetry (2)** are fundamental symmetries that all operators in SMEFT must respect individually, as they are required for the theory to be consistent with special relativity.
- **CP symmetry (3)** is not necessarily respected by all operators, as the theory can include CP-violating terms.
- **CPT symmetry (4)** is a requirement for the entire theory, but individual operators do not need to be CPT scalars themselves.

Thus, the correct answer is that all operators in SMEFT must respect **Lorentz symmetry (1)** and **Poincaré symmetry (2)**.

**Answer: A**
