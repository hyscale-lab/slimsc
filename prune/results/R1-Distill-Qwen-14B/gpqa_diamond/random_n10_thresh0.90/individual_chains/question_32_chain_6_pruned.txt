Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is "X," which is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6.

So, first things first, I need to find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I remember that the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be roughly (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) MeV/c². Let me calculate that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV
3 * 939 = 2817 MeV
Adding those together gives 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. Oh wait, but wait—wait a second, I think I might be mixing up the actual masses. I think the more precise values are: proton is about 938.272 MeV/c² and neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². Let me be more accurate.

So, each proton is 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6:

Protons: 3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV/c²
Neutrons: 3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV/c²
Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV/c². That's the rest mass energy.

Wait, but when you have a nucleus, sometimes there's a binding energy. Oh right, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. So the actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 * 938.272? Wait, no, wait—wait, I think for the purpose of these problems, they often approximate the mass of the nucleus as the sum of the protons and neutrons, or use the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number as the approximate mass in terms of nucleons, each with a mass of about 938 MeV/c².

Wait, perhaps I should just go with the atomic mass. The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.017586323 MeV/c² per nucleon? Wait, no, the atomic mass is measured in atomic mass units (u), and 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0176 u. Let me double-check that.

Yes, the exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.017586323 u. So converting that to MeV/c²: 6.017586323 * 931.5 ≈ let's calculate that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV
0.017586323 * 931.5 ≈ 16.36 MeV
So total ≈ 5589 +16.36 = 6005.36 MeV/c².

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u would be 5589 MeV/c². But Li-6 has a mass of about 6.0176 u. So the actual mass is 6.0176 * 931.5 = let me compute that.

6.0176 * 931.5 = 

Let me compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.0176 * 931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.5=9.315; 0.007*931.5=6.5205; 0.0006*931.5=0.5589. So 9.315 +6.5205=15.8355 +0.5589=16.3944.

So total is 5589 +16.3944 = 5605.3944 MeV/c².

So the rest mass energy is approximately 5605.3944 MeV, which is about 5.605 GeV.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting 6.0176 u, which is 5605.39 MeV, or about 5.605 GeV. So that's the rest energy, m c².

So the rest mass is m = 5605.39 MeV/c².

Now, the problem is about finding the energy when the speed is 0.96c.

In relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute gamma when v is 0.96c.

So v = 0.96 c.

Compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)

What's 0.96 squared? 0.96 *0.96= 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216= 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784)= 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈3.5714.

Wait, wait, exactly: 0.96^2=0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216=0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

But wait, 1/0.28 is 3.571428571... which is equal to 25/7 (since 25 /7 ≈3.57142857). Hmm, maybe it's better to use more precise calculations.

But let's proceed.

So gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m c².

But wait, m is already in MeV/c², so m c² is 5605.39 MeV.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5605.39 MeV.

Let me compute that.

3.57142857 is approximately 25/7. So 25/7 * 5605.39 ≈ let's compute 5605.39 *25= ?

5605.39 *25: 5605 *25 = 140125; 0.39 *25=9.75. So total is 140125 +9.75 =140134.75. Then divide by 7: 140134.75 /7 ≈20019.25 MeV.

Wait, 140134.75 MeV divided by 7: 140134.75 /7 = let's see, 7*20019=140,133. So 20019 *7 =140,133, so 140,134.75 is 140,133 +1.75. So 20019 + (1.75/7) = 20019 +0.25=20019.25 MeV.

Wait, so E is approximately 20019.25 MeV, which is 20.01925 GeV.

Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, option B is 23.069, option D is 21.419, option A is 18.475.

Hmm, but wait—am I making a mistake here? Because I used m c² as 5605.39 MeV, which is about 5.605 GeV. Then gamma is 3.5714, so 5.605 *3.5714= about 20 GeV.

But why doesn't the answer match exactly? Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Let me double-check.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², each neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3 protons: 3 *938.272=2814.816 MeV/c².

3 neutrons:3*939.565=2818.695 MeV/c².

Total: 2814.816 +2818.695=5633.511 MeV/c².

Wait, but that's the sum of individual nucleons, but the actual mass of the nucleus is less because of binding energy. So the actual mass is less than 5633.511 MeV/c².

Wait, no, wait—that's the problem. Because when you have the nucleus, the binding energy is the energy holding the nucleus together, so the rest mass is less than the sum of the individual protons and neutrons. So the actual rest mass is m = (sum of individual masses) - (binding energy). But for precise calculations, I can't just take the sum; I need the actual mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the mass number as the mass. So Li-6 has a mass number A=6. So perhaps they approximate the mass as 6 * (mass of a proton), or 6 * 938.272 MeV/c², which is 5629.632 MeV.

But wait, the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.017586323 u, which is 6 * 1.00256...? Because protons are about 1.0
