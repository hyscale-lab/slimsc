Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's see what each part involves.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible reagents A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by looking at the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So the structure is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, which is sodium cyanide, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. Wait, but in basic conditions? Or maybe something else.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-), it's usually under specific conditions. Oh right! I think the reaction is called the Stephen reduction, but wait, no, that's for ketones to aldehydes. Or maybe it's the addition of cyanide to a ketone. Oh, wait another thought: perhaps it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, that's right! A cyanohydrin forms when a ketone reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. So the general reaction is R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN, which is a cyanohydrin.

So for the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The product's structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CN. So the reaction is forming a cyanohydrin. The conditions for this are typically acidic. So reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is option A or B) or maybe something else.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. If the solution is acidic, the CN- would be in solution. So the reagent A is likely an acid, which would protonate the carbonyl oxygen to make it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack.

So for the first reaction, reagent A is H3O+ or maybe another acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ for A, options C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm, what does NaHSO3 do? It's sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-? Wait, but in solution, NaHSO3 would dissociate into Na+ and HSO3^-; in acidic conditions, HSO3^- can act as an acid, releasing H+ and SO3^2-.

But I think the cyanohydrin formation usually uses an acid catalyst. So A is probably H3O+. So in the options, either A or B, because those have H3O+ as A.

Wait, but in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives the cyanohydrin. So the conditions are acid-catalyzed. So A is H3O+ (like option A or B).

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH).

So, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? Well, one common method is hydrolysis. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. But wait, the product here is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be done under acidic conditions, I think.

The typical acidic hydrolysis of nitriles uses H3O+ (like H2SO4 and H2O) under heat. Alternatively, using HCl (like HCl and H2O) might be another way.

Looking at the reagent B in the second reaction, which is used with H2O. So the reagent B plus H2O would hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the starting material already has a hydroxyl group (2-hydroxy). So the structure is R-C(OH)-CH2-CN? No, wait the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so the structure is CH2(OH)C(R)CH2CN? Or wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure would be: the butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CN? No, wait butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile on the end. So butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, but the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's a tertiary alcohol attached to a nitrile.

In the second reaction, that same structure becomes a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile (CN) is converted to COOH. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

So the reagent B, in the presence of H2O, probably does the hydrolysis. Let's think about the conditions. For the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, one method is to first convert the nitrile to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, strong acid hydrolysis can do it in one step.

Wait, another approach: when you have a nitrile, you can hydrolyze it to an amide using H2O and a base, then acid workup to get the carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using strong acid and heat can hydrolyze directly to carboxylic acid.

But the reagent B could be an acid, like HCl, or maybe a strong acid. Let me think about the options. The options for B are HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). Or HCl is a strong acid, CH3COOH is a weak acid.

So, for hydrolysis of nitriles, HCl is often used. For example, in the hydrolysis of nitriles, HCl (concentrated) in aqueous solution under reflux is a common method. Or sometimes, you can use H2SO4 as the acid. So if the reagent B is HCl, then that would fit.

Looking at the second reaction, the reagent B is used with H2O. So, if B is HCl, then the hydrolysis is done in HCl and H2O, leading to the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. The first reaction's reagent A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. Let me look at the options again. The options are:

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, in the first reaction, if A is H3O+, that would act as the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. That fits with the first part.

For the second reaction, reagent B is HCl (so option A or C) or acetic acid (options B and D). So if B is HCl, then the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid under acidic conditions.

Wait, but wait another thought: in the second reaction, the starting material has a hydroxyl group. Does the reaction involve the nitrile group only, or is there any other functional group that might affect the reaction? Probably not. The hydroxyl is at the same carbon as the nitrile, so in the product, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile group is at the end, perhaps.

Wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Structure-wise, it's CH2CN-CH(OH)R, where R is the aryl group. Wait, no, butanenitrile is four carbons, so the structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)R-CN? Maybe I should draw it mentally. The molecule is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile substituted with a 4-benzylphenyl group on the same carbon as the hydroxyl and nitrile.

Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, so butan-1-nitrile. But the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2CH2CN? But wait, the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would have the structure (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's a tertiary alcohol attached to the nitrile.

So in the second reaction, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So it's (aryl group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl and nitrile). So the structure is (aryl)C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps (aryl)C(OH)CH2CH2CN? Wait, but it's butanenitrile, which is four carbons. So the nitrile is on C4, the hydroxyl on C2, which is also substituted with the aryl group. So the structure is:

CH2CH(OH)(aryl)CH2CN?

Wait, I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the exact structure isn't critical for choosing the reagents.

Coming back to the second reaction. The reagent B is either HCl or acetic acid. So which would be more appropriate for the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxylic acid?

I think using HCl in H2O (like HCl aqueous) would be a strong acid condition, facilitating the hydrolysis of the nitrile. Alternatively, using a weak acid like acetic acid might not be as effective, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction uses a base, but in the options, B is either HCl or acetic acid.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to amides under basic conditions, which are then acidified to form carboxylic acids. But in the options, B is either HCl (acid) or CH3COOH (acid). So perhaps the hydrolysis is in acidic conditions, which would go directly to the carboxylic acid.

So, if the second reaction uses HCl (option A or C), that would be the right reagent for the hydrolysis.

Putting it all together: For the first reaction, A is H3O+ (so option A or B), and for the second reaction, B is HCl (so option A or C).

Looking at the options, option A has A = H3O+, B = HCl, which fits.

Wait, but wait another point: when converting a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, sometimes you need more than just HCl and water. For example, you might need heat or a catalyst. But the question doesn't mention any other conditions, just the reagents. So assuming that reagent B is sufficient.

So, the correct reagents would be A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think about other possibilities. Could NaHSO3 be used in the first reaction?

NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate. It's a source of H+ and also HSO3^- which can act as a bisulfite. In some reactions, like the Clemmensen reduction, you use HCl and Zn(Hg) to reduce ketones to alkanes, but that's with HCl as the acid. But in the first reaction, it's the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is an acid-catalyzed addition.

Another thought: perhaps the first step uses H2SO4 as the acid catalyst. But in the options, the only acid available for A is H3O+ or NaHSO3. Since H3O+ is a strong acid (like from H2SO4), and NaHSO3 is a weaker acid, but can also provide H+ in solution.

Wait, but the reaction with NaCN and a ketone (butan-2-one) under acidic conditions. So, maybe using H3O+ is necessary to generate the necessary H+ to protonate the carbonyl.

So, putting it all together, the first reaction needs an acid (H3O+ as reagent A), and the second reaction needs HCl (reagent B) to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

So the correct option is A: A = H3O+, B = HCl.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the cyanide ion (CN⁻) to attack. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the most suitable reagent for this purpose, as it provides the necessary acidic conditions for the reaction.

The second reaction converts 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile into 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (CN) to a carboxylic acid (COOH). Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is commonly carried out under acidic conditions, and HCl is a strong acid that facilitates this transformation effectively. Acetic acid (CH₃COOH), being a weak acid, is less suitable for this reaction.

Based on the analysis, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ for the first reaction and B = HCl for the second reaction. This corresponds to **Option A**.
