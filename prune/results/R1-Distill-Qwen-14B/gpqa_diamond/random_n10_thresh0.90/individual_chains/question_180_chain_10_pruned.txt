Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the potential energy, right? Because if they're fixed, there's no movement, so no kinetic energy. So it's all about the potential energy between the charges.

Each charge is 2e. So each is a multiple of the elementary charge. e is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C.

Let me think about how the charges are arranged. There's one at point P, and twelve at 2 meters from P. But wait, the twelve charges are all 2 meters away from P. Hmm, so the system would have the central charge at P and the other 12 arranged in some kind of symmetric pattern around it. But since the problem mentions they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, maybe it's like a spherical arrangement or something. But wait, do I need to consider the distances between the other charges?

Wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. Potential energy in electrostatics is the sum of the potentials between each pair of charges. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair and sum them all.

But how many pairs are there? Let me think. The central charge is fixed, so each of the 12 charges will interact with the central one. So each of the 12 contributes a potential energy term with the central charge.

Also, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P. Are they placed symmetrically, like on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m? If so, the distance between any two of the 12 charges would be some value, but wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. It doesn't say anything about their mutual distances, so perhaps we can ignore the interactions between the
