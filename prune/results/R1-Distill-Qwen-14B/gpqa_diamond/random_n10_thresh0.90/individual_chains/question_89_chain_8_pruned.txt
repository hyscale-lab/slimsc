Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's break it down slowly.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to visualize the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead carbons. So, it's a pretty rigid structure because of the adamantane framework.

First reaction: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo elimination reactions to form alkenes. But wait, 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal; the bromines are on opposite ends. Oh, wait, no, in adamantane, 1 and 3 positions are adjacent bridgeheads. Because in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons, but the positions 1 and 3 might be on adjacent bridgeheads. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Wait, in adamantane, each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So 1 and 3 would be non-adjacent? Or perhaps they are across a bridge? No, maybe in the 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads. So when KOH is added, it would likely cause an elimination reaction, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane... if each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and those bridgeheads are adjacent (like in a bicyclic structure), then eliminating two HBr's would form a double bond between them, creating an exo double bond within the adamantane framework. The product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene, perhaps? Or maybe the elimination leads to a more substituted double bond.

But wait, in the product description, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's quite upfield for a CH2, or maybe it's an -OCH2- group. Wait, but if KOH is used, perhaps it leads to the formation of a ketone or an ether. Wait, no, KOH is a base and could deprotonate. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 4.79, which is around the region for an -OCH2- group or possibly a CH2 next to an oxygen. The IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an ester. Oh wait, 1720 is usually a ketone. So maybe product 1 is an ketone.

Wait, but if we eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a double bond, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But KOH is a strong base; substitution would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. But with two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. For example, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons (1 and 2 positions), then eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond. But the product's NMR has a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That might be two equivalent protons in a certain environment. Let me think of a structure that fits.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of an epoxide? No, that would require a cyclic ether, but the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch, and the NMR doesn't show a singlet in the 3-4 ppm region, which epoxide protons usually do.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diketone. But then the IR would show two carbonyl peaks. Hmm, not sure. Or perhaps it's a monoketone. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane on treatment with KOH could deprotonate to form a carbanion, but that doesn't directly form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with two leaving groups, maybe it's a double substitution. Like, the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr, forming a double bond. But again, that would give an alkene, which wouldn't have a carbonyl in the IR.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination. Maybe KOH is acting as a base and abstracting a proton, leading to a conjugate base, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a peroxide effect, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, going back to the product. The IR shows 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe the product is a ketone with an adjacent CH2 group. Let me think about the structure.

If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr molecules, but in such a way that a ketone is formed. Wait, but elimination would form an alkene, substitution could form an ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing the formation of an epoxide, but that would require a different setup.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation. For instance, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr's, forming a diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an alcohol or a ketone through some mechanism. Wait, but KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in substitution. Oh, wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxide attacks a carbon adjacent to bromine. But that would require a good leaving group. Wait, but for substitution, we might need a better leaving group, but bromide is a decent leaving group.

Wait, perhaps each bromide is replaced by a hydroxyl group. But that would require two substitutions, leading to two hydroxyl groups. But the NMR doesn't show broad peaks for OH groups, so maybe they're exchanged with D2O, but the question says to exclude those that exchange with the solvent.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that typically gives alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the NMR shows 4.79 ppm (2H). That could be an -OCH2CH2O- group, but with only 2H, it's a methylene adjacent to something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Like, a ketone with a CH2 near it. So, maybe the structure is something like a cyclohexanone ring, but in the adamantane framework.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's think: if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses HBr and forms a carbonyl group. How would that happen? Maybe via a double dehydrohalogenation with formation of a ketone.

Wait, but how? Let me think about the mechanism. If each Br is on a bridgehead, and each elimination leads to a carbonyl group. Oh wait, perhaps each Br is on adjacent bridgeheads, and eliminating two HBr's between them would form a double bond, but that's not a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the bridgehead carbons after elimination have a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the steps after product 1.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically used as a Lewis acid catalyst, perhaps in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 1's structure is important here. Let me try to figure that out first.

So, the product 1 has a 1H NMR of 4.79 (2H), 2.41–2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an adamantanone, a ketone within the adamantane structure.

Wait, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two HBr's, perhaps via double elimination, forming a double bond. But wait, that would form a diene, which doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dearomatization or some other process. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with KOH, they eliminate two molecules of HX to form an alkene. So if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, the product would be an alkene. But wait, 1,3 in adamantane might not be adjacent. Let me think about the structure.

Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead is a carbon connected to three other bridgeheads. So, 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads, so when KOH is added, elimination occurs, removing two HBr molecules, and forming a double bond between those two bridgeheads. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene.

But then, why is there a carbonyl in the IR? Because alkene's don't have a carbonyl. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't an alkene but a ketone. How?

Wait, perhaps the elimination forms a carbonyl. Let me think about the mechanism. If the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, and upon elimination, we form a double bond. But that would require each bromide to be on adjacent carbons, but that's elimination to form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe if the bridgehead carbons lose HBr, but the structure could rearrange.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen β to both bromines, leading to the formation of a carbene or some intermediate that then forms a carbonyl. Hmm, that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the double elimination leads to a carbonyl group through some kind of deprotonation and rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but I can't see how that would form a ketone. Another thought: Maybe the KOH is leading to a nucleophilic attack, but on what? If the adamantane framework is very rigid, the bromide might not be in a position to undergo substitution easily.

Wait, perhaps the product isn't from elimination but a substitution. Maybe each Br is replaced by an hydroxyl group, but then we would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons. But in the NMR, we don't see broad peaks for OH (since they're exchanged with D2O), but the 4.79 ppm peak is for two H's. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol, but again, no carbonyl.

Wait, going back to the NMR data: 4.79 (2H) could be an -OCH2- group, perhaps in an epoxide or an ether. The 2.41–2.23 (10H) are probably the bridgehead protons in the adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another set of protons, perhaps in a CH2 group adjacent to something else.

Wait, maybe product 1 is not an elimination product but a substitution to form an ether. But with two Br's, it's more likely a di-ether, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a ketone via some mechanism I'm not considering.

Hmm, perhaps I should move to the next step and see if that helps. Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is commonly used as a Lewis acid catalyst, especially in Friedel-Crafts reactions. So, if product 1 has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), perhaps product 2 is formed via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires an aromatic ring, right? So, if product 1 has a ketone group, maybe it's part of an aromatic system. Alternatively, maybe product 1 isn't aromatic but has a carbonyl group that can form an acylium ion.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and the aluminum isopropoxide is used in ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: treating a ketone with aluminum isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acylation. Maybe product 1 is an aldehyde or ketone, and under Friedel-Crafts conditions, it undergoes some reaction, perhaps forming a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diene, and aluminum isopropoxide is used to catalyze some addition, like a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction. But without a dienophile present, maybe that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck on these initial steps. Let me think about the ozone step.

Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. Ozone is used in ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. When ozonolysis is performed, the double bond breaks, and depending on the substituents, aldehydes or ketones are formed.

So, product 2 has a double bond, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product. The NMR of product 3 will show the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups formed during ozonolysis.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would likely be the ones closest to electronegative groups, like carbonyls. So in the ozonolysis product, the protons adjacent to carbonyl groups could be the most deshielded.

Let me think about the structure of product 2. If product 2 is formed by treating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide, and product 1 is a ketone, perhaps product 2 is an acylium ion or some kind of enol ether.

Wait, no. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. If product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's involved in a Friedel-Crafts acylation. That would require an aromatic ring, though. Alternatively, if product 1 is an alkene, perhaps it's used in a polymerization or another reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and the aluminum isopropoxide is used in a ring-opening or some other reaction. Not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Ozonolysis is for double bonds, but if product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would work. So perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, which upon treatment with aluminum isopropoxide forms an alkene. But I'm not familiar with that specific
