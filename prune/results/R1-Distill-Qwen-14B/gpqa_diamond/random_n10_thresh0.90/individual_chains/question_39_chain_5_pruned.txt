Okay, so I need to find the value of 'a' in this quantum mechanics problem. Let's start by understanding what's given.

We have a wave function given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, but wave functions usually have both real and imaginary parts, right? Because the wave function is a complex-valued function. But I'm a bit confused about the form here. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is written as a complex number where the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. But wait, that doesn't make much sense dimensionally. Maybe it's a sum of real and imaginary terms? Or perhaps the entire expression is the wave function, like ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That could be the case.

Wait, the problem says that the wave function is described as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5*i. So the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. Now, in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square (probability density) over all space must equal 1.

But the question states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero (or non-existent) outside this interval. So the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3. But according to the given wave function, it's (a / sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, but wait, that would imply that it's non-zero only where sqrt(1+x) is real, so 1+x >0 → x>-1. But the measurement says x is between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the given wave function is valid only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the question says that each particle can exist in a part of space, perhaps that part is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is non-zero only in that region. So I need to normalize the wave function in that interval.

Wait, the wave function is given as ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1 + x) - 0.5i. But for wave functions, the normalization involves integrating |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3.

Wait, the complex conjugate of ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when we multiply ψ by its conjugate, we get the magnitude squared.

So |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 + [a/(sqrt(1+x)) * 0.5i - a/(sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i)] ... Wait, no. Wait, no, when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i), you get (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 + (a * 0.5i * sqrt(1+x)) terms? Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

Wait, (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i) multiplied by (a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) equals [a/sqrt(1+x)]^2 + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(...)) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(...)) + (0.5i)(0.5i) ?

Wait, no. Wait, (x - y)(x + y) = x² - y². So here, x is a/sqrt(1+x), y is 0.5i. So the product is (a²)/(1+x) - (0.5i)^2. But i² is -1. So (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 * i² = 0.25*(-
