Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with some numbers in meters.

Hmm. I remember that decay properties are related to the lifetime of the particle, and the decay distance is how far it travels before decaying. The mean decay length is usually calculated using the lifetime multiplied by the speed of the particle and its energy, I think.

Wait, wait. So the mean decay distance L is given by L = γ * β * c * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime, γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over c, and c is the speed of light. But wait, I think there's another approach when dealing with resonances and their widths.

Oh right! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ through the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty relation says that Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I need to be careful with the units here. Γ is the total decay width, which is an energy, and τ is the lifetime. So yes, Γ equals ħ divided by τ.

Wait, no, the Heisenberg uncertainty is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. But for a resonance, the width Γ is roughly 2ΔE, so Γ ≈ ħ / τ, which gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

Once I have τ, I need to calculate how far the particle travels before decaying. That depends on its velocity. So, to get the mean decay length, I should compute L = v * τ. But wait, no. Because L is v multiplied by the time, which is τ multiplied by the Lorentz factor γ if the particle is moving relativistically. Wait, no, because v is already the velocity, and the lifetime is the proper lifetime. Hmm, I might be getting confused here.

Alternatively, the mean lifetime that the lab frame observes is γ times the proper lifetime τ. So the lifetime in the lab frame is τ' = γ τ. So the mean distance L is v * τ' = v * γ τ. But v is β c, so L = β γ c τ.

Wait, but how do I find τ? So first, calculate τ using Γ. Since τ is ħ / Γ, but I need to make sure the units are correct.

So let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / (Γ), making sure units are compatible.
2. Compute the velocity β of the meson. To do that, I need to find the energy and mass. Since E = γ m c², so γ = E / (m c²). But wait, E here is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma would be E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV c²) * (1/(c²)) ? Wait, no, perhaps better to compute β gamma from E and m.

Alternatively, since E = γ m c², and p = γ m β c. So the relativistic energy is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c²)^2. So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2). Then, p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c.

But maybe there's a better way. Let me think about β and gamma.

Another approach: from E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, let's compute gamma first. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV c²) * (1/c²) ? Wait, no, I think I'm mixing units here. Let me be precise.

Wait, E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV/c². So when calculating gamma, it's E/(m c^2) because E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → Wait, units: GeV / (GeV) = 1/(c^0) ? Wait, no, because m is in GeV/c², so m c² is GeV. So yes, gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / (1.2) = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So about 6.6667.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Wait, gamma is about 6.6667, so 1/gamma² is 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225, so 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root, sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887. So the velocity is about 0.9887 c.

So now, back to the decay length. The mean decay distance should be L = beta gamma c tau.

Wait, because L = v * t, where t is the lifetime as observed in the lab frame. The proper lifetime is tau, and the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So t = gamma tau. So L = v * gamma tau.

And v is beta c, so L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, so yes, L = beta gamma c tau.

Now, tau is the proper lifetime, which is hbar / (Gamma). So Gamma is given as 320 MeV. Let's make sure units are consistent.

Gamma is 320 MeV. Planck constant hbar is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV.

So Gamma = 0.320 GeV.

So tau = hbar / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) ) → 6.582e-25 / 0.320 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, compute beta * gamma * c * tau.

Beta is ~0.9887, gamma is ~6.6667.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute beta * gamma: 0.9887 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.606.

Then, c * tau: 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.1706e-16 meters.

Now, multiply this by beta gamma: 6.606 * 6.1706e-16 m.

Wait, 6.606 * 6.1706 ≈ 40.65 (because 6*6 is 36, 0.606*6=3.636, 6*0.1706=1.0236, 0.606*0.1706≈0.1033; adding all up: 36 + 3.636 +1.0236 +0.1033 ≈ 40.7629. Hmm, but perhaps I should compute it accurately.

Wait, 6.606 *6.1706. Let me compute it properly:

6 *6 =36, 6*0.1706=1.0236; 0.606*6=3.636; 0.606 *0.1706≈0.1033.

Adding all parts: 36 + 1.0236=37.0236; 37.0236 +3.636=40.6596; 40.6596 +0.1033≈40.7629.

So about 40.763e-16 meters, which is 4.0763e-15 meters.

Wait, but 6.606 *6.1706e-16 equals approximately 40.76e-16 m, which is 4.076e-15 m.

Looking back at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm, seems my approximate calculation gives around 4.07e-15 m, which is close to option B's 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, perhaps I made some approximations earlier. Let me re-calculate with more precise numbers.

Let me re-calculate each step with more precision.

First, Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.320 GeV.

Tau = hbar / Gamma.

hbar = 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) ) = (6.582 / 0.320 ) * 1e-25 s.

6.582 / 0.320 = let's compute that.

0.320 * 20 = 6.4, which is just under 6.582.

Let me compute 6.582 / 0.320:

6.582 divided by 0.32.

6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875.

Because 0.32 *20=6.4, 0.32 *20.56875=6.582.

So tau = 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, beta gamma: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Gamma is 8/1.2 = 6.666666...

So gamma squared is (6.666666...)^2 = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈44.4444.

1/gamma squared is 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) = let me calculate.

sqrt(0.9775): since 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775.

Wait, 0.9887 * 0.9887: 0.98 * 0.98 =0.9604; 0.0087 * 0.98 = ~0.008526; 0.0087^2 is ~0.00007569. Wait, no, perhaps better to calculate accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like approach.

But let me proceed. Let's say beta ≈ 0.9887.

So beta = 0.9887, gamma = 6.6667.

So beta * gamma = 0.9887 * 6.6667 = let's compute it accurately.

6.6667 * 0.9887: 

Compute 6.6667 * 0.9 = 6.00003.

6.6667 *0.08 = 0.533336.

6.6667 *0.0087= let's compute 6.6667 * 0.008 = 0.0533336; 6.6667 * 0.0007= 0.00466669.

So 0.0087 is sum of 0.008 and 0.0007.

Adding up:

6.00003 + 0.533336 =6.533366.

Plus 0.0533336 →6.5867.

Plus 0.00466669 →6.591366.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6.6667 * 0.9887.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 6.6667 * 0.9887 = let's compute it as 6.6667*(1 - 0.0113) = 6.6667 - 6.6667 *0.0113.

Compute 6.6667 * 0.01 = 0.066667.

6.6667 * 0.0013 = 0.0086667.

So total subtracted: 0.066667 + 0.0086667 = 0.0753337.

So 6.6667 - 0.0753337 = approximately 6.591366.

So beta gamma is approximately 6.591366.

Now, compute c * tau.

c = 3e8 m/s.

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 3 * 2.056875e-16 m.

3 * 2.056875 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Now, multiply by beta gamma: 6.170625e-16 m * 6.591366.

Let me compute 6.170625e-16 *6.591366.

First, 6.170625 *6.591366.

Hmm, compute 6 *6=36, 6 *0.591366=3.548196; 0.170625 *6=1.02375; 0.170625 *0.591366≈0.1008.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 6.170625 * 6.591366.

Alternatively, 6 *6.591366 =39.548196.

0.170625 *6.591366 ≈ let's compute 0.1 *6.591366=0.6591366; 0.07*6.591366≈0.46139562; 0.000625 *6.591366 ≈ ~0.0040571.

Adding them: 0.6591366 +0.46139562=1.12053222 +0.0040571=1.124589.

So total is 39.548196 +1.124589=40.672785.

So 6.170625 *6.591366 ≈40.672785.

So the product is 40.672785e-16 m = 4.0672785e-15 m.

Looking back at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct values for beta and gamma. Let me re-calculate beta and gamma with more precision.

Gamma is E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... exactly, because 8 /1.2=20/3≈6.666666667.

So, gamma = 20/3.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (pc)^2 = E² - (m c^2)^2.

p c = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) → p = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / c.

But beta is (p c^2)/E → beta = (p c) * c / E → beta = sqrt(E² - m² c^4) / E.

Since E is given in GeV and m is in GeV/c², we can compute beta as sqrt( (8^2) - (1.2)^2 ) /8.

Wait, because (E)^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) → but when E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², perhaps we can write in terms of (GeV/c²)^2.

Wait, perhaps better to compute beta = sqrt( 1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2) ) = sqrt(1 - (m^2)/(E^2) ) because when you have E in GeV and m in GeV/c², E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → (m c²)^2 = m^2 c^4 → but in terms of units, perhaps E and m are both in the same energy unit, so when E and m are in GeV, m c^2 is in GeV, and E is in GeV. So the ratio (m c^2)^2 / E^2 = (m/E)^2.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

Wait, but let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more accurately.

Compute 0.9887^2: 0.9887 * 0.9887.

Compute 0.98^2 = 0.9604.

Then, 0.0087 * 2 *0.98 → 0.0087 * 1.96 ≈ 0.017112.

0.0087^2 ≈0.00007569.

Adding all: 0.9604 + 0.017112 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97758769, which is very close to 0.9775.

So beta = 0.9887.

So beta gamma is 0.9887 * 6.666666... = let's compute this precisely.

6.666666667 * 0.9887.

Compute 6 *0.9887 =5.9322.

0.666666667 * 0.9887 = let's compute 2/3 *0.9887 ≈0.6591.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.6591 =6.5913.

So beta gamma is exactly 6.5913.

So, c * tau =3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma: 6.5913 *6.170625e-16 m.

Compute 6.5913 *6.170625.

6 *6.170625=37.02375.

0.5913 *6.170625.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625 =3.0853125.

0.0913 *6.170625 ≈ let's see: 0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625; 0.0013 *6.170625=0.0079818125. So total ≈0.55535625 +0.0079818125 =0.5633380625.

So 0.5913 *6.170625 ≈3.0853125 +0.5633380625=3.6486505625.

So total 6.5913 *6.170625 =37.02375 +3.6486505625=40.6724005625.

So 40.6724e-16 m =4.06724e-15 m.

The options are:

B)4.0655e-15 m.

C)5.0223e-15 m.

Hmm. My calculation is 4.0672e-15 m, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close. There's probably a slight difference due to more precise calculation of beta or gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the beta gamma product.

Wait, maybe using exact fractions would give a more precise result.

Gamma is 20/3, which is approximately 6.6666666667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (3/20)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 9/400) = sqrt(391/400) = sqrt(391)/20.

Wait, 391 is 19*20.5789, but perhaps sqrt(391) is approximately 19.774.

Wait, sqrt(391) = approx 19.774.

So beta = 19.774 /20 ≈0.9887.

So beta = 0.9887.

So beta gamma = (19.774/20 ) * (20/3 ) )= 19.774 /3 ≈6.5913.

So, beta gamma is exactly (sqrt(391)/20) * (20/3) )= sqrt(391)/(3) ≈19.774/3 ≈6.5913.

So, the exact product would be 6.5913.

So, 6.5913 * 6.170625e-16 m = 40.6724e-16 m =4.06724e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is a bit lower. Hmm, maybe I should recalculate with more precise values.

Wait, perhaps let me compute 6.5913 *6.170625.

Let me compute 6.5913 *6.170625.

Breaking it down:

6 *6.170625 =37.02375.

0.5913 *6.170625.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.0913 *6.170625.

Compute 0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625.

0.0013 *6.170625=0.0079818125.

So, 0.55535625 +0.0079818125=0.5633380625.

So total 3.0853125 +0.5633380625=3.6486505625.

So total is 37.02375 +3.6486505625=40.6724005625.

So 40.6724005625e-16 m =4.06724005625e-15 m.

The option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for beta and hbar.

Wait, let's calculate beta more accurately.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (m/E)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2 ) = sqrt(1 -0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775).

What is sqrt(0.9775) more precisely?

Let me compute it.

0.9775 is 391/400.

Compute sqrt(391) ≈19.77418.

So sqrt(391/400)=19.77418/20=0.988709.

So beta=0.988709.

So beta gamma=0.988709 * (20/3) = approximately 0.988709 *6.666666667.

Compute 0.988709 *6 =5.932254.

0.988709 *0.666666667= approx 0.659139.

So total is 5.932254 +0.659139=6.591393.

So beta gamma=6.591393.

Now, c * tau is 3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by 6.591393.

6.591393 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.591393 *6.170625.

=6 *6.170625 =37.02375.

0.591393 *6.170625.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.091393 *6.170625.

Compute 0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625.

0.001393 *6.170625=approx 0.008566.

So 0.55535625 +0.008566=0.56392225.

So 3.0853125 +0.56392225=3.64923475.

So total 37.02375 +3.64923475=40.67298475.

So 40.67298475e-16 m =4.067298475e-15 m.

Hmm, that's about 4.0673e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of tau.

Tau is hbar / Gamma.

hbar is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma is 0.320 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25) /0.320 =2.056875e-24 s.

But perhaps I should use a more precise value for hbar.

The value of hbar is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me check: hbar is 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

So yes, tau =6.582e-25 /0.320 = (6.582 /0.320 )e-25 s.

6.582 /0.320 =20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the width is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. But perhaps I should consider that Gamma is in the rest frame, but the decay length depends on the lab frame lifetime.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up proper time and lab frame. But I think I did it correctly.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length can be calculated using L = c * tau * gamma * beta.

Yes, that's what I did. So let me think why the answer is not matching precisely.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation for beta is more precise. Let me compute beta using more precise sqrt(0.9775).

Compute sqrt(0.9775):

0.9887^2=0.97758769. So 0.9887^2=0.97758769.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775. So the actual beta is a little less than 0.9887.

Because 0.9887^2=0.97758769>0.9775.

So let me compute sqrt(0.9775) more precisely.

Let me compute sqrt(0.9775) using the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me take an initial guess of x=0.9887.

x1 = (x0 + 0.9775 /x0)/2.

Compute x0=0.9887.

x1 = (0.9887 + 0.9775/0.9887 ) /2.

Compute 0.9775 /0.9887 ≈0.98868.

So x1≈ (0.9887 +0.98868 ) /2 ≈ (1.97738)/2=0.98869.

Compute x1=0.98869.

Check x1^2 =0.98869^2.

0.98869 *0.98869.

Compute 0.98^2=0.9604.

0.00869 * 2 *0.98=0.00869 *1.96≈0.01705.

0.00869^2≈0.0000755.

So total≈0.9604 +0.01705=0.97745 +0.0000755≈0.9775255.

Which is a bit higher than 0.9775.

So need to go further.

x2 = (0.98869 + (0.9775)/(0.98869)) /2.

Compute 0.9775 /0.98869 ≈0.98868.

So x2≈(0.98869 +0.98868)/2 = (1.97737)/2=0.988685.

Now, x2=0.988685.

Compute x2^2= (0.988685)^2.

= (0.98868 +0.000005)^2 ≈0.98868^2 + 2*0.98868 *0.000005 + (0.000005)^2.

0.98868^2 = (0.98869)^2 - 2*0.98869 *0.00001 + (0.00001)^2.

Wait, 0.98868^2 = (0.98869 -0.00001)^2 = 0.98869^2 - 2*0.98869*0.00001 + (0.00001)^2.

We know 0.98869^2 ≈0.9775255.

So 0.98868^2 ≈0.9775255 - 2 *0.98869e-5 + 1e-10.

=0.9775255 - 0.0000197738 ≈0.977505726.

Which is less than 0.9775 by 0.977505726 -0.9775 =0.000005726.

Wait, but 0.9775 is 0.977500000.

So 0.98868^2≈0.977505726.

Which is 0.000005726 higher than 0.9775.

So to find x where x^2=0.9775, we need to find x <0.98868.

Let me compute x3=0.98868 - delta.

We have x2=0.98868, x2^2=0.977505726.

We need x^2=0.9775, which is 0.977500000.

So delta_x = (0.977505726 -0.9775)/(2*x2).

Which is (0.000005726)/(2*0.98868) )=0.000005726/(1.97736)≈2.9e-6.

So x3 =x2 - delta_x =0.98868 -2.9e-6≈0.9886771.

Compute x3^2.

= (0.9886771)^2 ≈ (0.98868 -0.0000029)^2.

= 0.98868^2 - 2*0.98868*0.0000029 + (0.0000029)^2.

Which is approximately 0.977505726 - 0.000005722 + ~8.4e-9.

≈0.977505726 -0.000005722 =0.977500004.

Which is very close to 0.9775.

So beta is approximately 0.9886771.

So beta=0.9886771.

So beta gamma=0.9886771 * (20/3)= (0.9886771 *20)/3=19.773542/3≈6.591180667.

So beta gamma ≈6.591180667.

Now, compute L = beta gamma * c * tau.

c * tau=3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s=6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by beta gamma:6.591180667 *6.170625e-16.

Compute 6.591180667 *6.170625.

6 *6.170625 =37.02375.

0.591180667 *6.170625.

Compute 0.5 *6.170625=3.0853125.

0.091180667 *6.170625.

Compute 0.09 *6.170625=0.55535625.

0.001180667 *6.170625≈0.007282.

So sum:0.55535625 +0.007282=0.56263825.

So 3.0853125 +0.56263825=3.64795075.

So total 37.02375 +3.64795075=40.67170075.

So L=40.67170075e-16 m =4.067170075e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m. Hmm, close but not matching. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the decay width is given as 320 MeV, but perhaps it's in a different unit or requires a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the natural units where c=1, but I think the approach I took is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mean decay length is calculated using the formula L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Which is the same as what I did.

Wait, I think the difference is due to the precise calculation of beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of E = 8 GeV as the energy of the meson, so perhaps the calculation considers that the meson is produced at rest, but that can't be because then gamma would be 1 and beta zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the production energy is the same as the kinetic energy, but that would change things.

Wait, no, the production energy is given as E_X=8 GeV, which is the total energy (Kinetic + rest mass energy). So that's correctly used for gamma.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the decay width is given in MeV, so 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV, but perhaps I should have converted it into GeV correctly, which I did.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the decay width is in the rest frame, but the decay length is in the lab frame, which I did account for with gamma and beta.

Another thing: perhaps the mean decay distance is calculated using the formula L = (c * tau) * (gamma * beta).

Which is what I have.

Wait, perhaps I should write the entire formula again.

L = c * tau * gamma * beta.

But tau is hbar / Gamma.

So L = c * (hbar/Gamma) * gamma * beta.

But Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So let me plug in the numbers:

c =3e8 m/s.

hbar=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

gamma=8/(1.2)=6.666666...=20/3.

beta= sqrt(1 - (1.2/8)^2 )=sqrt(1 -0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)=0.9887.

So,

L = 3e8 m/s * (6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV ) * (20/3) * (0.9887).

Let me compute step by step.

First, compute (hbar/Gamma):6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply by c: 3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma:6.170625e-16 m * (20/3) =6.170625e-16 *6.666666...=4.11375e-15 m.

Wait, wait, no. Because gamma is 20/3, so 6.170625e-16 * (20/3) = (6.170625 *20)/3 *1e-16 = (123.4125)/3 *1e-16 =41.1375e-16 m =4.11375e-15 m.

Wait, that's different. Then multiply by beta:4.11375e-15 m *0.9887 ≈4.073e-15 m.

Hmm, but earlier calculation was 4.067e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of multiplication.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute gamma * beta first.

Gamma=20/3, beta=0.9887.

gamma * beta= (20/3) *0.9887 ≈6.5913.

So, L = c * tau * gamma * beta.

Compute c * tau =3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s =6.170625e-16 m.

Multiply by gamma beta (6.5913):6.170625e-16 *6.5913 ≈4.067e-15 m.

Which brings me back to the same number.

So why is option B 4.0655e-15 m?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for hbar.

I used hbar=6.582e-25 GeV·s.

But more precisely, hbar is approximately 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV·s. Let me check.

Yes, hbar ≈6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

But perhaps a more precise value is 6.581797e-25 GeV·s.

Let me try that.

So, hbar=6.581797e-25 GeV·s.

Gamma=0.320 GeV.

Tau =6.581797e-25 /0.320 =20.567490625e-25 s =2.0567490625e-24 s.

c*tau=3e8 m/s *2.0567490625e-24 s =6.1702471875e-16 m.

Now, multiply by gamma beta=6.5913.

6.1702471875e-16 m *6.5913 ≈?

Compute 6.1702471875 *6.5913.

6 *6.5913=39.5478.

0.1702471875 *6.5913.

0.1 *6.5913=0.65913.

0.07 *6.5913=0.461391.

0.0002471875 *6.5913≈0.001628.

So, 0.65913 +0.461391=1.120521 +0.001628=1.122149.

So total 39.5478 +1.122149=40.669949.

So 40.669949e-16 m =4.0669949e-15 m.

Still, it's approximately 4.067e-15 m, but option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, perhaps the actual calculation uses more precise beta and gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, and my approximation is just slightly off.

Given that, and given that the closest option is B, I'll choose option B as the correct answer.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{m^2}{E^2}} \) is the velocity of the particle in units of \( c \),
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( \Gamma \) is the total decay width.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The energy \( E \) and mass \( m \) are given as \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.\overline{6}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \)
Using the relativistic relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.\overline{6})^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.444}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \). The reduced Planck constant is \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \), and the decay width \( \Gamma \) is \( 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.320 \, \text{GeV} \). Thus:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.320} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by:

\[
L = \beta \gamma c \tau
\]

Substitute the known values:
- \( \beta \gamma = 0.9887 \times 6.\overline{6} \approx 6.5913 \),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \).

First, calculate \( c \tau \):

\[
c \tau = (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{m}
\]

Now, multiply by \( \beta \gamma \):

\[
L = 6.5913 \times 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with options
The calculated value \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is very close to option **B** (\( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
