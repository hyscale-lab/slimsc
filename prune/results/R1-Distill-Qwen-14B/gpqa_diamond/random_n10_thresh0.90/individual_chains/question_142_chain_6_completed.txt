Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, right, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when dealing with mixed states.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that this looks familiar. Oh right, this is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. But wait, what does that mean geometrically?

I think when a qubit is in a maximally mixed state, it's like it's in a completely classical state, meaning it's not in a superposition but rather an equal mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So the density matrix is a statistical mixture of the two basis states, each with probability 1/2.

Now, the question is about its position in the qubits space. I remember that the space of qubits can be represented as a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the state space of a qubit. Any state can be represented as a point on or inside the unit sphere in 3D space.

The general form of a qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector with components (x, y, z) such that its length is ≤ 1. So when I expand ρ, I can compare it to this general form.

Let me compute ρ for the given case. The given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is the outer product, which for the computational basis is [[1,0],[0,0]], and similarly |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then ρ is (I)/2.

The general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ = I/2, then I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. Because I/2 minus (I + r·σ)/2 is ( -r·σ )/2, which equals zero only if r·σ is zero.

Wait, the Pauli matrices σ are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So r·σ would be r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So if r·σ is zero, each component must be zero. Because each Pauli matrix is non-zero. So the only way their sum is zero is if each coefficient is zero. So r_x must be zero, r_y must be zero, and r_z must be zero. So the vector r is (0, 0, 0). 

Wait, but then the point is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is the completely depolarized state. It's the center of the Bloch sphere because it's the completely mixed state, which has zero coherence and equal probability for both states.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but let me think again. The Bloch vector r points from the origin to the surface of the sphere for pure states, but for mixed states, it's inside. So for the completely mixed state, it's at the center. So yes, r is (0,0,0).


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right),
\]

which represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. This state can be interpreted geometrically using the Bloch sphere representation of qubit states. In this representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector \((r_x, r_y, r_z)\) with \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\). The vector \(\mathbf{r}\) determines the position of the state on or inside the Bloch sphere.

For the given density matrix, substituting \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\) into the general form shows that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the surface of the Bloch sphere.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this corresponds to the completely mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this does not represent a valid quantum state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
