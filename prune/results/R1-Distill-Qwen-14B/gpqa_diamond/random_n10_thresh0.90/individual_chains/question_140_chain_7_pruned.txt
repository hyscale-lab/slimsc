Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question talks about Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y to produce a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Additionally, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Wow, that's a lot. Let's try to parse this.

First, I need to figure out what Substance X might be. The clue that it's used as a reagent in organic chemistry makes me think of common reagents. One that comes to mind is something like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7, or perhaps something else like NaOH. Wait, but considering the reaction with a liquid Y, which could be something like water or maybe another solution.

Wait, the reaction is violent, so perhaps it's something reactive. Another thought: considering the product gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about common gases. For example, O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in each molecule. No, wait, O has atomic number 8, so O2 would have 8 each. So each O atom has 8 protons, and the number of neutrons depends on the isotope. But in O2, each molecule has 16 (8+8) for each O, so O2 is O=16. Alternatively, maybe hydrogen? No, H2 has 1 proton and 0 neutrons each, so W's molecule would have same protons and neutrons. So per molecule, protons and neutrons are equal.

Wait, gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, total protons = total neutrons. Let's think of some possibilities.

Another approach: maybe a molecule where each atom contributes equally. For example, CO2 has 1 C (6 protons) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 =22. Neutrons: C is 6 (isotope?), O is 8 each. Wait, but the molecule would have more neutrons than protons. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, if W is a molecule with the same number of protons and neutrons per molecule. Let's think of possible gases. For example, CH4: C has 6 p, H has 1 each. So CH4 would have 6 + 4(1) =10 p. Neutrons: C is 6 (if it's 12C), H has 0. So 6 neutrons. 10 p and 6 n: not equal. So that's not it.

What about O2? Each O atom has 8 p and 8 n (if it's 16O). So O2 has 16 p and 16 n, so same. So that fits. So W would be O2 gas.

Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule. So each O atom has 8 p and
