Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is given by (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including both pure and mixed states. Since this is a mixed state, the density matrix must have certain properties.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The state is a density matrix, so each term is a projector. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices, I think. Oh right, the general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector (rx, ry, rz) and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if I can express the given ρ in that form, I can find the components of r. Let me write down the given ρ:

ρ = (1/2) (|0><0| + |1><1| )

Wait, |0><0| is a projector that's 1 in the (0,0) position, and |1><1| is 1 in the (1,1) position. So when I add them, the diagonal elements are both 1, and off-diagonal are zero. So the matrix would be:

[[1/2, 0],
 [0, 1/2]]

Hmm, because each term is multiplied by 1/2. So each diagonal element is (1/2)*1, and the off-diagonals are (1/2)*0.

Now, let's compare this to the general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's compute that.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. Each Pauli matrix is σx, σy, σz.

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So r·σ = rx σx + ry σy + rz σz.

Putting it all together, (I + r·σ)/2 is:

(1/2) * [ [1 + rz, rx - i ry],
           [rx + i ry, 1 - rz] ]

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ (1 + rz)/2 , (rx - i ry)/2 ],
  [ (rx + i ry)/2 , (1 - rz)/2 ] ]

Now, the given ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements 1/2. Let's see what that implies for the components rx, ry, rz.

Looking at the (1,1) element of our general form: (1 + rz)/2 = 1/2. So (1 + rz) = 1 → rz=0.

Similarly, the (2,2) element is (1 - rz)/2 = 1/2. That simplifies to 1 - rz = 1 → rz again 0.

Now, looking at the off-diagonal terms: (rx - i ry)/2 must equal 0, and similarly for the (2,1) term. So rx - i ry = 0, and rx + i ry = 0. Wait, that's only possible if rx and ry are both zero. Because, for example, if rx is not zero, then ry would have to be equal to i rx, but that would make the terms non-zero, which isn't the case here.

So putting this together: rx = 0, ry = 0, rz = 0.

Therefore, the vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that's the answer.

I think I got that right. Let me double-check. The density matrix given is a completely mixed state for a qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, the completely mixed state is at the origin, which corresponds to r=(0,0,0). Yeah, that makes sense because a mixed state with maximum entropy can't be aligned in any direction on the Bloch sphere; it's at the center.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. This corresponds to a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

Density matrices can generally be expressed in the form 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector that determines the state's position on the Bloch sphere. Expanding this general form, the density matrix becomes:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\
r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given density matrix, the diagonal elements yield:

\[
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_z = 0,
\]
\[
\frac{1 - r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_z = 0.
\]

The off-diagonal elements yield:

\[
\frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_x = 0, \, r_y = 0.
\]

Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is \( (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is represented by the origin on the Bloch sphere.

From the options provided:

- **A)** \( r = (1, 1, 0) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state on the Bloch sphere.
- **B)** \( r = (0, 0, 1) \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to the state \( |1\rangle \), not a mixed state.
- **C)** \( r = (0, 0, 0) \): Correct, as this represents the completely mixed state at the origin.
- **D)** \( r = (1, 1, 1) \): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to any valid quantum state.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
