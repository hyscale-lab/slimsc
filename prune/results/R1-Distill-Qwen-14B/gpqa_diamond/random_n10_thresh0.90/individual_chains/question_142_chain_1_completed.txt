Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are all coordinate points (r), which probably correspond to some vector in a 3D space, maybe Bloch sphere coordinates?

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that out in matrix form. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented as [1, 0] and [0, 1] respectively. So |0⟩⟨0| would be a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is 1 at (2,2), zeros elsewhere. Adding these matrices gives a diagonal matrix with 1s on both diagonal elements. Multiplying by 1/2 gives a diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. So ρ is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both diagonal entries 0.5.

Wait, density matrices for pure states are idempotent (ρ²=ρ), but mixed states aren't. Let me check if this ρ is idempotent. Let's compute ρ squared. Each element of ρ is 0.5 on the diagonal. Multiplying ρ by itself, each diagonal element would be (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So ρ² = 0.25 I, which is not equal to ρ. So ρ is a mixed state. But what does that mean for its position in the qubit space?

I think the Bloch sphere representation is key here. For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. The density matrix for a pure state |ψ⟩ is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, which corresponds to a point on the surface of the Bloch sphere. For mixed states, the density matrix can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, with the purity determining how far from the origin it is.

But wait, the given ρ looks like a completely mixed state. Let me think. The completely mixed state for a single qubit is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Wait, no, I is 2x2, so I/2 would have 0.5 on the diagonal. So yes, that's exactly what ρ is. So it's the maximally mixed state.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the maximally mixed state is represented by the origin, right? Because it's completely unpolarized. So the vector r would be (0,0,0). But wait, let me make sure. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector in 3D space, with components r_x, r_y, r_z. The length of r can't exceed 1 because the density matrix must be positive semidefinite and trace class.

So, if ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2, that means r is (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which should be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is a 2x2 diagonal matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. This represents a mixed state, specifically the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. For the maximally mixed state, the corresponding vector in the Bloch sphere representation is at the origin, as it is completely unpolarized.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix in Bloch sphere coordinates is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in 3D space, and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the maximally mixed state, \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), meaning the state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is:

\[
\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0).
\]

Answer: C
