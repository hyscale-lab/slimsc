Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that extends the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 8, etc. But the question is about which symmetries all operators must respect.

The options are four: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, CPT. The question lists them as 1,2,3,4, and the options are combinations of these.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Oh right, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But the question is asking which must be respected by all operators. So if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it probably doesn't respect Poincare either.

In SMEFT, the operators are typically constructed to respect gauge symmetry, which includes the SM gauge groups, and also some global symmetries. But what about Lorentz and Poincare? I think that all terms in the Lagrangian must respect Poincare symmetry, because the SMEFT Lagrangian is a Lorentz-invariant theory. Because if you didn't have Poincare symmetry, the theory wouldn't make sense in a Lorentz covariant way—like the physics would depend on the frame, which isn't good.

So Poincare symmetry (option 2) is about spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations. So all operators must respect both, right? Wait, but wait, option 1 is Lorentz and option 2 is Poincare. So if operators respect Poincare, they must also respect Lorentz. So the question is, do all operators respect both, or only one of them?

Wait, the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Because the theory is based on the Standard Model, which is Lorentz-invariant. So that means any operator you add must be a scalar under Lorentz transformations. So yes, Lorentz symmetry (option 1) must be respected.

Wait, but Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. So if the operator is a Lorentz scalar, it's automatically respecting Lorentz symmetry. But what about Poincare? Well, the SMEFT is a field theory, so the operators are local, and the theory is translation invariant because the effective field theory approach assumes that you can do a low-energy expansion, which relies on local symmetry. So all operators must respect Poincare symmetry as well.

Wait, but that would mean that both 1 and 2 are required. So the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So both Lorentz and Poincare are needed. So that would be options A, C, or other? Let me think.

But wait, in the SMEFT framework, the operators are written in a way that respects the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. The SM itself respects Lorentz and gauge symmetries, and also Poincare. So any operator beyond the SM in SMEFT must also respect these. So yes, operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare.

So that's options 1 and 2. What about the other options, CP and CPT?

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. The Standard Model isn't CP symmetric; in fact, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So the SMEFT includes operators that can violate CP. Therefore, operators in SMEFT don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is a combination of charge, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model, as far as we know, respects CPT symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect CPT? I think that's the case because the SMEFT is built upon the SM which respects CPT. So any operator added must also respect CPT. Because if an operator didn't respect CPT, it would imply that the theory doesn't either, which isn't part of SMEFT's framework.

Wait, but wait—operators are written in terms of the fields, and CPT symmetry relates particle and antiparticle states. So any operator must have a corresponding CPT-conjugate operator. But in the SMEFT, all operators are constructed respecting the SM's symmetries, so they must respect CPT as well. So option 4 (CPT) is a must.

Wait, so the operators must respect Poincare (which includes Lorentz), so 1 and 2. Also, they must respect CPT (option 4). So which options among the choices include 1,2,4?

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is option 1,2,4.

Wait, but I thought earlier that SMEFT operators must have Lorentz symmetry and Poincare. So that
