Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (beta) tell us about the stability of a complex ion. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex is.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, I need to make sense of these. Oh right, each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN^- ligands. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^0 or something similar, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Or maybe it depends on the charge balance. I think the general formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), where the charge would be 2 - n, since Co^2+ starts with +2 charge and each SCN^- is -1. So n=1: +1 charge, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would have a charge of 2+ - n(-1) = 2-n. So for n=1: 2-1=+1, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2. So the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^(+), [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But the problem refers to "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Dithiocyanato implies two SCN groups, right? So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be the dithiocyanato complex. So we're being asked about the percentage of this species among all cobalt species.

Wait, but what about the other complexes? The question is about the blue ones, which I think refers specifically to the [Co(SCN)_2]^(n) complex. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the colors, but I'll proceed with the given data.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So higher β for β3 and β2. Wait, β3 is 63 which is higher than β2 (40). So the most stable complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^-—probably. But wait, sometimes the order can depend on the concentrations, but the higher β usually means more stable.

So here's what I think: We need to find the fraction of Co^2+ that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Because that's the dithiocyanate (two SCN) complex, which is the blue one.

To find the percentage, I need to calculate the mole fractions of each possible cobalt species, and then sum up the fractions for the desired species.

Wait, the total cobalt is 1e-2 M. But in solution, it's distributed among the various complexes and the free Co^2+ ion. So the sum of all species' concentrations should equal c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

The general approach is to set up equations for each complex's concentration based on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN^-.

But wait, the concentration of SCN^- is 0.1 M, which is quite high. That might mean that most of the Co^2+ is complexed, but I'm not sure yet.

The stability constants are given by β_n = [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n

But considering all the possible complexes, the total [Co] is the sum of [Co^2+] and all the complexes. So:

Total [Co] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = 1e-2 M.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, for each complex:

[CoSCN^+] = β1 * x * (SCN^-)^1 = 9 * x * 0.1
[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * x * (0.1)^2 = 40 * x * 0.01 = 0.4 x
[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * x * (0.1)^3 = 63 * x * 0.001 = 0.063 x
[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 * x * (0.1)^4 =16 * x * 0.0001= 0.0016 x

So adding all these:

Total [Co] = x + 9x(0.1) + 40x(0.1)^2 +63x(0.1)^3 +16x(0.1)^4 = 1e-2

Wait, no: wait, the [CoSCN^+] is β1 x [SCN^-]^1, which is 9 x * 0.1. So [CoSCN^+] = 0.9 x.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 40 x (0.1)^2 = 40 x * 0.01= 0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- is 63 x (0.1)^3 =63 x * 0.001= 0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is 16 x (0.1)^4=16 x * 0.0001= 0.0016 x.

So total [Co] = x + 0.9 x + 0.4 x + 0.063 x + 0.0016 x.

Adding these up: x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016) = x (2.3646) = 1e-2.

So x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.226e-3 M.

Wait, but wait a minute. Does the presence of other metals (like if any) or other ions affect this? Hmm, the problem states it's a solution of Co(II) and SCN^-, so I think that's all we have to consider.

So now, the concentrations of each species are:

[Co^2+] = x ≈4.226e-3 M.

[CoSCN^+] = 0.9 x ≈0.9 *4.226e-3= 3.803e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 =0.4 x≈0.4 *4.226e-3=1.690e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =0.063 x≈0.063 *4.226e-3≈2.663e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}=0.0016 x≈6.76e-6 M.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term correctly:

Let me compute the sum more accurately. Let me compute each term step by step.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model the problem correctly. Another approach is to express everything in terms of x, the free Co^2+ concentration.

So, [Co^2+] = x.

[CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 * x *0.1=0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 x [SCN^-]^2=40 x (0.1)^2 =40 x *0.01=0.4 x.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 x [SCN^-]^3=63 x (0.001)=0.063 x.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}= β4 x [SCN^-]^4=16 x (0.0001)=0.0016 x.

So the total Co is:

x + 0.9 x + 0.4 x + 0.063 x + 0.0016 x = x (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) = x*(2.3646) =1e-2.

Thus, x= (1e-2)/2.3646 ≈ 0.004226 M.

So now, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 0.4 x, which is 0.4 *0.004226 ≈ 0.001690 M.

The question is, what's the percentage of this complex among all cobalt species.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, so each species is a fraction of that.

So the fraction is [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / c(Co) *100%.

Which is (0.001690) / (0.01) *100% ≈16.9%.

Wait, that's 16.9%, which is option D. But wait, I thought the answer was option C or A? Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it again.

Wait, 0.001690 divided by 0.01 is 0.169, so 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the "blue dithiocyanato" complex. So if [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is the blue one, then the percentage is approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, let me think again, perhaps I missed something. Because the problem says 'the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16'. So β3 is the largest, which would suggest that [CoSCN3^-] is the most stable, so it would have the highest concentration.

But according to our calculation, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is 0.063 x, which is about 0.000266 M, which is much smaller than [Co(SCN)_2], which is 0.00169 M. So why is that so?

Ah, because even though β3 is higher, the higher-order complexes require more SCN^- per Co. But in this case, the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which isn't that high. So the higher-order complexes might not be as dominant.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility of other equilibria. Wait, another thought: perhaps the assumption that x is very small compared to [SCN^-] is valid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should model it more accurately. Let me see.

Wait, another approach is to model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the given [SCN^-]. But the problem is that there are four possible complexes, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the most significant species are Co(SCN)_2^0 and Co(SCN)_3^−, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the fractions properly. So the total concentration is 1e-2 M. The [Co^2+] is x, which is 4.226e-3 M. So [Co^2+] is 4.226 mM.

The other species:

[CoSCN^+] = 0.9x ≈3.803e-3 M → 3.803 mM.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0=0.4x≈1.690 mM.

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =0.063x≈0.266 mM.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}=0.0016x≈6.76e-6 M= 0.00676 μM.

So the largest species is [CoSCN^+] (3.803 mM), followed by [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (1.690 mM), then Co^2+ (4.226 mM?), wait no, [Co^2+] is 4.226 mM, which is the largest.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake. Because:

x is [Co^2+] =4.226e-3 M =4.226 mM.

But [CoSCN^+] is 0.9 x=3.803 mM.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0=0.4 x=1.690 mM.

So [Co^2+] is 4.226 mM, which is higher than [CoSCN^+] (3.8 mM) and higher than [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

But that would imply that the free Co^2+ is the most abundant. Hmm, that seems a bit counterintuitive because β1 is 9, but perhaps because [SCN^-] is 0.1, which is not very high.

Wait, let me think again. So the [Co^2+] is 4.226 mM, and the sum of all the complexes is 3.803 + 1.690 + 0.266 + 0.00676 ≈5.765 mM. Plus the free Co^2+ gives 4.226 +5.765= ~9.991 mM, which doesn't make sense because the total is only 10 mM. So that aligns correctly.

So the [Co^2+] is 4.226 mM, which is the largest, then [CoSCN^+] is 3.803 mM, then [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 1.690 mM, etc.

Wait, so the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 1.690 mM, which is about 16.9% of the total 10 mM (10 mM is 0.01 M).

So the percentage is (1.690 mM / 10 mM ) *100 = 16.9%.

So the answer is D) 16.9%.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So that's 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought the beta3 is higher, but perhaps the concentration of SCN^- isn't high enough to form higher-order complexes in significant amounts. So the largest complex would be the first one, then the second, etc., but in this case, the [Co^2+] is the major species.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because with a stability constant β=9, and [SCN^-]=0.1, the [CoSCN^+] would be significant.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate the total [Co]:

x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x = x*(1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016)= x*(2.3646).

Set equal to 0.01 M, so x= 0.01 / 2.3646 ≈0.004226 M.

So [Co^2+] = 0.004226 M (4.226 mM).

[CoSCN^+]=0.9 * 0.004226 ≈0.003803 M (3.803 mM).

[Co(SCN)_2]^0=0.4*0.004226≈0.001690 M (1.690 mM).

[Co(SCN)_3]^- =0.063*0.004226≈0.000266 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}=0.0016*0.004226≈0.00000676 M.

Now, the total is 4.226 +3.803 +1.690 +0.266 +0.00676 =10.0 M. So that adds up correctly.

So the percentage for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is (1.690 mM /10 mM)*100=16.9%.

So the correct answer is D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations.

### Key Information:
- Total cobalt concentration: \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- Thiocyanate concentration: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- Stability constants: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

The stability constants describe the formation of cobalt thiocyanato complexes:
- \( \beta_1 \): [CoSCN]^+
- \( \beta_2 \): [Co(SCN)_2]^0
- \( \beta_3 \): [Co(SCN)_3]^-
- \( \beta_4 \): [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}

The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the free Co\(^2+\) ion and all possible complexes:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
\]

Using the stability constants, the concentrations of the complexes can be expressed in terms of the free Co\(^2+\) concentration (\(x\)):
\[
[\text{CoSCN}^+] = \beta_1 x [\text{SCN}^-] = 9x(0.1) = 0.9x
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = \beta_2 x [\text{SCN}^-]^2 = 40x(0.1)^2 = 0.4x
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = \beta_3 x [\text{SCN}^-]^3 = 63x(0.1)^3 = 0.063x
\]
\[
[\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = \beta_4 x [\text{SCN}^-]^4 = 16x(0.1)^4 = 0.0016x
\]

Substituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation:
\[
c(\text{Co}) = x + 0.9x + 0.4x + 0.063x + 0.0016x
\]
\[
10^{-2} = x(1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016)
\]
\[
10^{-2} = x(2.3646)
\]
\[
x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
\]

Now, calculate the concentration of each species:
- \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x = 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{CoSCN}^+] = 0.9x = 0.9(4.226 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 3.803 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] = 0.4x = 0.4(4.226 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 1.690 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] = 0.063x = 0.063(4.226 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 2.663 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \)
- \( [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}] = 0.0016x = 0.0016(4.226 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 6.76 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M} \)

The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{c(\text{Co})} \times 100 = \frac{1.690 \times 10^{-3}}{10^{-2}} \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
