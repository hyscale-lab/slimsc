Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me some values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. Oh right, the formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime, but the lifetime comes from the particle's width. Wait, decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle, right? So Γ ≈ ħ / τ. Or wait, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for the width, which is the energy uncertainty, that would mean Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But I might have the factors a bit wrong; maybe it's Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Decay width Γ is the total width, which is the inverse of the mean lifetime, right? So Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense. 

Once I have τ, the mean decay distance would be the velocity v multiplied by τ. Oh right, because distance is velocity times time. So L = v * τ. But what's the velocity of the meson here?

To find the velocity, I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is related to the mass and momentum p by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So I can solve for p: p = sqrt( (E² - (mc²)^2) ) / c²? Wait no, let me think again. The relation is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So solving for p, we get p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c² ?

Wait, let me write that correctly. Let me rearrange E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. Then pc = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ). So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the momentum p in units where c=1, but since I'm dealing with SI units, I have to be careful.

Alternatively, I can compute the velocity. Another approach is to find the velocity using the relation v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)).

Wait, yeah, because in special relativity, the energy E is gamma m c², and momentum is gamma m v. So, let's try to find v.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Wait, but the units here are a bit messy. Let me make sure to handle the units correctly. E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c², so maybe it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then I have to convert back to meters at the end.

Alternatively, let's convert everything into compatible units. Let's think in terms of E, m, and c.

Wait, another thought: the meson's lifetime is tau = hbar / Gamma. But Gamma is given in MeV, so I have to make sure the units are compatible. Because hbar has units of GeV·s when considering energy in GeV. Wait, no, hbar is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So I can use that.

Wait, let's jot down the known values:

E = 8 GeV
m = 1.2 GeV/c² (because m_X is 1.2 GeV, but when working with E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, m must be in GeV/c². Oh wait, but if m is given in GeV, then perhaps I should think in terms of m c^2, which is in GeV. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, m is the rest mass. So m c² is the rest energy. So if m is 1.2 GeV, that would imply m c² is 1.2 GeV. So perhaps the mass is given as 1.2 GeV/c². Because E = mc², so m in GeV/c² gives E in GeV.

So, E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV/c², Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, to calculate the velocity, I can use the relativistic formula:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)}.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

m = 1.2 GeV/c², E =8 GeV.

Compute (m c²)^2 = (1.2 GeV)^2. Because m
