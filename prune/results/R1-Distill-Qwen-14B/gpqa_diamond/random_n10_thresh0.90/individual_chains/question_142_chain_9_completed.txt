Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can figure it out.

The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are different points in 3D space, given as r=(x,y,z) coordinates.

Wait, I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

In the Bloch sphere model, a pure state |ψ> can be written as (|0> + e^{iθ} cos(φ/2) |1> ) / sqrt(2), but wait, the exact parametrization might vary. Or another way: any single qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (x,y,z) with |r| ≤ 1.

So, if I have ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let me compute that. Well, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them together and dividing by 2 gives a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Now, the general form for a density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2. Let's write that out. I is the identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]], and r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So (I + r·σ)/2 would be [ [ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ], [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ].

Comparing this with the given ρ, which is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], I can set the two matrices equal. So:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

Similarly, (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5 → same result, r_z=0.

Now, the off-diagonal terms: (r_x - i r_y)/2 must equal 0. So both r_x and r_y must be zero because for a complex number (a+ib) to be zero, a and b must be zero. So (r_x -i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x=0 and r_y=0.

So the vector r is (0,0,0). Wait, but that's the origin. That means the state is completely mixed, right? Because the pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere (r of length 1), and the completely mixed state is at the center (r=0).

So in terms of the options provided:

Option C is (0,0,0), which would be the origin. So the geometrical position is the origin in the qubit space.

Wait, but why is this the case? The density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's equivalent to the completely mixed state, which maximizes the entropy because it's equally probable in both |0> and |1>. So the Bloch vector should be zero, placing it at the center of the sphere.

So looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0) → probably not, since that's a point outside the Bloch sphere.

B) (0,0,1) → that's the state |0> when r_z=1, but here r_z is zero.

C) (0,0,0) → this matches our calculation.

D) (1,1,1) → way outside the sphere, so not a valid state.

So the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with entries \([0.5, 0.5]\). For a single qubit, any density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector with \(|\mathbf{r}| \leq 1\). Comparing the given \(\rho\) with this general form, we find:

1. The diagonal terms of \(\rho\) imply \((1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5\) and \((1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5\), leading to \(r_z = 0\).
2. The off-diagonal terms of \(\rho\) are zero, which implies \((r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0\), leading to \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\).

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is located at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** This point lies outside the Bloch sphere and is not valid.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), which is not the case here.
- **C) \((0,0,0)\):** This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\):** This point lies outside the Bloch sphere and is not valid.

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents the completely mixed state at the origin.

Answer: C
