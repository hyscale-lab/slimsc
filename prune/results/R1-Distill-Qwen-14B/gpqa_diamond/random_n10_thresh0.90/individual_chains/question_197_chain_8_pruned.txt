Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, wait. Clemmensen uses HCl with Zn-Hg, but wait, no, I think that's for aldehydes. Oh wait, maybe I'm confusing with the other reactions. Let me think again. Oh, right, the Clemmensen reduction uses HCl with Zn(Hg) as a catalyst to reduce ketones to alkanes by removing the oxygen. But wait, I think the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is actually the HWE (Hoffmann–Wittig) reaction, but no, wait, the Wittig reaction usually involves triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide, generating a phosphonium salt which then reacts with a base. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not the Wittig. Wait, another thought: the reaction of a carbonyl with red phosphorus and HI is the preparation of an ylide for the Wittig reaction. Or maybe it's a deoxygenation. Oh, wait, another possibility: the reaction of a carbonyl group with HCl (like HCl in H2O) would protonate the carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Wait, no, I think that's the Clemmensen reduction, which uses HCl and Zn(Hg). Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Red phosphorus and HI could be used in the presence of a carbonyl group to form an imidate or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol. No, wait, no, that's with something else. Maybe it's the hydrolysis of a nitrile? No, I think that involves H2O, H3O+.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the spectral data first. The compound has both IR and NMR data. Let me process that.

Starting with the IR: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region, possibly from an -OH stretch or maybe an amide or something else. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might suggest aromatic rings, possibly with substituents. Those are around the regions for C=C stretching in aromatic compounds.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm, and they're typically broad because they can exchange with water. So this could be a COOH proton. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde, but that's less likely if there's a carbonyl elsewhere.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. If it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, so that fits. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but then the 10.5 ppm peak in the NMR would correspond to the COOH proton. Let me think about that. So if the compound has a COOH group, but then what else? Let's look at the NMR more carefully.

Other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those are typical of an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. So maybe a para-substituted benzene. The two doublets each integrating for 2H each suggest that. So perhaps the benzene has two substituents at para positions, each causing the neighboring protons to couple.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something that's probably a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, maybe. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) might be a methylene group or perhaps a CH adjacent to branching.

Putting this together: The aromatic part is para-substituted. One substituent is the COOH group, and the other substituent is a side chain.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet for 1H. If it's a COOH group, that would make sense. Let's count the substituents. The benzene has two groups: one is COOH, and the other is a substituent with a side chain.

The substituent on the benzene (let's say at para position) is probably a chain that explains the NMR signals. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be a CH2 connected to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH connected to another group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think: Maybe a -CH2CH(CH3)2? Or wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but let me map it out.

Looking at the substituent's NMR:

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, so maybe a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but wait, that would be butyl. But the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So let's see:

One possible structure is a benzene ring with substituents at the para positions: one is COOH, and the other is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a chain like -CH2CH(CH2CH3) or something else.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The NMR has:

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → probably a methyl group attached to a CH group, like CH(CH3) something.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → perhaps two protons on a CH2 connected to another CH or branching.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → a CH group connected to more groups.

So perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something. Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with branching.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. Let me try drawing it.

Wait, but putting this together with the other signals. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH, like CH(CH3). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two protons on a CH2 adjacent to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH connected to the CH(CH3) and the CH2.

So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching, like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a (CH2CH(CH3)2) group. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The substituent might be a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH(CH3)2) or something else. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here; perhaps I should think about the options given.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, let's analyze each option.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with ethyl group at position 4 (para), and a propanoic acid group at position 2 (ortho). Wait, no, wait: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would be benzene with a substituent at position 4 (ethyl) and the propanoic acid at position 2. Wait, but the propanoic acid would have the -COOH group at position 2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene has a substituent at position 4, which is ethyl, and another substituent at position 2, which is a propanoic acid. But wait, the NMR doesn't seem to have an ethyl group. Because in the NMR, the substituents are 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which is a terminal methyl, suggesting a longer chain.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a benzene ring with isobutyl group at position 1 and methyl at position 4. Wait, but that's para positions. The isobutyl group would be -CH2CH(CH3)2. The NMR of such a compound would have signals for the isobutyl group. Let's think: the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. The central CH has two CH3 groups attached. So the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 (next to the benzene), a multiplet for the CH group, and two sets of CH3 groups. But the NMR given has a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a methyl attached to a CH. That fits with the CH(CH3)2 group. But wait, the isobutyl group might not have a triplet for the CH2 attached to the benzene.

Wait, but option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, which is also known as cumene. Its NMR would have a triplet for the CH2 between the benzene and the CH(CH3)2. But in the given data, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) the methyl groups. Hmm, that might fit.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which would suggest a carbonyl group, but option B is a benzene with substituents, no carbonyl. So the IR would not have 1720 cm-1. So option B is probably not the correct answer because the IR shows a strong carbonyl.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 4 and a COOH group at position 1 (or maybe position 4 and COOH at another position? Wait, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid would have the COOH at position 1 (since the substituent is at position 4). Let me draw it: benzene with COOH at position 1, and sec-butyl at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the substituent would be a CH2CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the benzene at position 4.

In the NMR, the COOH proton would be around 10.5 ppm, which matches the data. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, as observed (8.0 and 7.2 ppm), which fits a para-substituted benzene with two groups: COOH and another substituent.

Now, the substituent's NMR: the -CH2CH2CH(CH3) group. Let's see:

The CH(CH3) would have a methyl group attached. The protons on CH2 would be split into different multiplets.

But in the NMR data, we have 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) which would correspond to the methyl group attached to the CH. So the CH is connected to a CH2CH2 group and a methyl.

Wait, but the substituent is sec-butyl, which is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the structure is benzene-COOH, and the substituent is CH2CH2CH(CH3) at para position.

So the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. The NMR signals would be as follows:

The CH(CH3) would have a methyl group (d, 3H) at around 1.4 ppm.

The CH2 next to the benzene (the first CH2) would be attached to the benzene ring, so perhaps it's a triplet or something else. The next CH2 (the middle one) would be between two CH2 groups, perhaps a quartet. Wait, but in the given data, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the two protons on the middle CH2, and the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH attached to the methyl.

Wait, but let me think about the actual splitting. The substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-. The first CH2 (attached to benzene) would be next to a CH2, so perhaps a triplet. The middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups, so a quartet or more complex splitting. The CH would have two adjacent CH2 groups, so perhaps a septet or something, but the given NMR shows a multiplet, which can be anything.

But in the NMR data, the 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be the CH group. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be the middle CH2, and the 1.4 ppm (3H, d) would be the methyl on the CH.

Wait, but the substituent is -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. So the CH2 next to the benzene would be a triplet, but in the data, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be that CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the benzene might be more deshielded and appear at a higher ppm.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, which suggests it's a terminal methyl group. So perhaps the substituent is longer, like a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit with the options given.

Wait, let me look at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a benzene ring with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. But that's more about substitution positions, but the main thing is that there's no carbonyl group. So the IR wouldn't have the 1720 cm-1 peak. So option D is probably not correct either.

Wait, but the IR shows a 1720 cm-1 peak, which suggests a carbonyl group, so the product must have that. So options C and A have carbonyls.

So option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl group at 4 and propanoic acid at 2. So the propanoic acid is -CH2CH2COOH attached to the benzene at position 2. Let's see the NMR.

The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, as in the data. The substituent would have a -CH2CH2COOH group. So the NMR would have signals for the ethyl group (CH2CH2), but the substituent is -CH2CH2COOH. The CH2 groups would show as multiplets.

But the given NMR has 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), which would be the terminal methyl of an ethyl group. So maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch at the end.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. The compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Earlier, I thought it might be a reduction, perhaps of a ketone to an alkane. But wait, what else could it be?

Wait, if compound X has a carbonyl group (like a ketone or carboxylic acid), and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a substitution reaction or a reduction.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the reaction. Let me recall that red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of aldehydes or ketones to form imidates or other intermediates. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a ylide for the Wittig reaction, but the question is about the product after the reaction, so that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. For example, if the compound has a tosyl group or a leaving group, the HI might perform an SN2 reaction. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a deoxygenation, turning a ketone into an alkane. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, a ketone might be reduced to a methylene group. Wait, I think that's the Clemmensen reduction. Wait, no, Clemmensen uses HCl with Zn(Hg), but perhaps I'm mixing reactions.

Wait, another possibility: the use of red phosphorus and HI is for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. No, that typically involves H2O and H3O+.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine, but that would use H2 and a catalyst, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to an alkyne or alkene, but that's not directly relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group (like a ketone) to a methylene group (CH2) using red phosphorus and HI. If that's the case, then the carbonyl would be replaced by a CH2 group, and the product would be an alkane.

Wait, but looking at the options, the products are either benzoic acid derivatives or substituted benzene rings. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Compound X has a ketone group. So if it's reduced to a CH2 group, then the product would have that CH2 in place of the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR and IR data again.

The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is consistent with a carbonyl group. The 10.5 ppm NMR peak is probably a carboxylic acid proton. So the compound has a COOH group.

The substituent on the benzene is a group that includes a long chain. Looking at the NMR shifts, the substituent includes a CH2CH(CH3) group or similar.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have the structure:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the substituent is a three-carbon chain attached to the ring, with a methyl branch.

So the substituent would be -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-.

In the NMR, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH(CH3) would have the methyl group as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H).

- The CH2 next to the benzene (first CH2) would be a triplet, but that's not in the data. Alternatively, perhaps it's a multiplet due to coupling.

Wait, the substituent order would be benzene-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3). So the first CH2 (attached to benzene) would have protons that are next to another CH2, leading to a triplet. The middle CH2 would be between two CH2 groups, leading to a more complex multiplet. The CH would have two adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a perhaps a septet, but in the data, it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

The terminal methyl (CH3) would appear as a triplet around 1.4 ppm, but in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, suggesting perhaps a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, but the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)2CH(CH3). So the first CH2 (attached to benzene) would have two protons, and the next CH2 would have two protons, and the CH would have one proton attached to a methyl.

So the NMR for the substituent would have:

- The first CH2 (attached to benzene) as a triplet at around 2.9 ppm? No, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps it's the CH group that's at 2.9 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, so the first CH2 is attached to the benzene. The first CH2 (attached to benzene) would be a triplet because it's adjacent to another CH2. The middle CH2 would be a quartet because it's between two CH2 groups. The CH would be a septet because it's adjacent to a CH2 with two protons and a CH2 with two. But the given data has a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which could be the CH.

The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be the middle CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl on the CH.

Additionally, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, which suggests a terminal methyl group. Wait, that doesn't fit with the substituent in option C, which is a sec-butyl group. The substituent in option C is -(CH2)2CH(CH3), so the terminal group is a CH(CH3), not a terminal CH2CH2CH3.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the substituent again.

If the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, perhaps it's -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. But that doesn't make sense because that's a four-carbon group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a butyl group arranged as a sec-butyl. So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a iso-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. So the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH(CH3)2 group would have a methyl group attached as a triplet. Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which would fit a methyl attached to a CH.

The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) would be the CH group in the iso-butyl substituent.

The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) would be the CH2 attached to the benzene, which is split into a multiplet.

But wait, the iso-butyl group would have -CH2-CH(CH3)2, so the CH2 next to benzene would be a triplet (coupled with the CH), but in the data, it's a multiplet. Hmm.

Wait, but looking again at the NMR data, the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)- group. But that would require more carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3)- group, which is a propyl group with a methyl branch at the end.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again. Only options A and C have a carbonyl group, which matches the IR.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propan
