Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a muon, which is like a particle similar to an electron but heavier. The operator in question is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvector we need to find corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, so the direction n is in the x-z plane. That probably means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, right? So the vector n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

But wait, the operator is P, which I think is the spin operator. Because in quantum mechanics, the spin components are usually represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So for spin-1/2 particles like electrons or muons, the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z, each of which are (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrices.

Wait, the problem says the operator is P, but it's acting on a muon, which has spin-1/2. So maybe P is the spin operator. So P = ħ/2 * σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So the problem is about finding the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n. The eigenvector corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2, so we're looking for the eigenstate with spin up along direction n.

The general approach for finding eigenvectors of spin operators along an arbitrary direction is to construct the operator P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Then, find the eigenvectors of this operator for the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, in this case, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So the operator becomes P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So let's write out each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me compute this.

First, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ. So:

P_n = (sinθ)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (cosθ)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So factor out (ħ/2):

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] is:
[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is:
[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Add these two matrices together:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator P_n is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

The eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2, so:

P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Let me write P_n more clearly:

P_n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
              [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the equation is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ],
          [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by (ħ/2), so:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these as equations:

1) cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
2) sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let's rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0
=> a (1 - cosθ) = b sinθ   [since (cosθ -1 )= - (1 - cosθ)]

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
sinθ a - b (cosθ +1) =0
=> sinθ a = b (cosθ + 1)

Now let's see if I can combine these.

From equation 1, a = [b sinθ]/(1 - cosθ)
From equation 2, a = [b (cosθ + 1)] / sinθ

So set them equal:

[ b sinθ ]/(1 - cosθ) = [b (cosθ +1)] / sinθ

Assuming b ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by b:

sinθ / (1 - cosθ) = (cosθ + 1)/sinθ

Multiply both sides by (1 - cosθ) sinθ:

sin²θ = (cosθ +1)(1 - cosθ)

The right side is (1 - cos²θ) which is sin²θ. So this is an identity, which means the equations are dependent, and we have a non-trivial solution.

So the eigenvectors are determined up to a scalar multiple. Let me choose a parameter to express a in terms of b.

From equation 1, a (1 - cosθ) = b sinθ
So a = [b sinθ]/(1 - cosθ)

Let me express sinθ and (1 - cosθ) in terms of tan(theta/2), using trigonometric identities.

We know that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)
And sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So substituting, a = [b * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [2 sin²(theta/2) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

a = [b cos(theta/2)] / sin(theta/2)
= b cot(theta/2)

So a = b cot(theta/2)

So the eigenvector can be written as [a; b] = [cot(theta/2), 1]^T multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, but that's only if b=1, but perhaps it's better to write in terms of theta/2.

Alternatively, let's think of the eigenvector as proportional to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T multiplied by some factor, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me see.

Wait, if a = b cot(theta/2), then let's let b = 1, so a = cot(theta/2). So the vector is [cot(theta/2), 1].

But let's compute the normalization factor. The eigenvector must be normalized, so the sum of the squares of the magnitudes (considering complex numbers) must be 1.

In this case, since the vector is [a, b] where a and b are real numbers, the normalization is sqrt(a² + b²) =1.

So with a = cot(theta/2), b =1,

Compute a² + b² = cot²(theta/2) + 1 = csc²(theta/2) = 1 / sin²(theta/2)

So the normalization factor is sqrt( sin²(theta/2) ) = |sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is an angle between 0 and pi (as it's in the x-z plane), sin(theta/2) is positive.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ sin(theta/2) * cot(theta/2), sin(theta/2) * 1 ]

Wait, let me compute that:

sin(theta/2) * cot(theta/2) = sin(theta/2) * [cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2)] ] = cos(theta/2)

And the second component is sin(theta/2) *1.

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Wait a minute, that's a very familiar form. It's the eigenstate for spin-up in the z-direction when theta is zero. But wait, no, theta is the angle from the z-axis, so perhaps this is correct because when theta is 0, the direction is along z, and the eigenvector is [1, 0], which fits with cos(0/2) =1, sin(0/2)=0.

Wait, no, cos(theta/2) when theta is zero is 1. So that makes sense.

But wait, in our earlier steps, the eigenvector came out as [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T, which is the same as the eigenstate for spin-up along the z-axis. But when the direction is along the z-axis, that's correct. But when the direction is along x, theta is 90 degrees, so theta/2 is 45 degrees, and the eigenvector becomes [cos(45), sin(45)] = [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is correct for the x-direction eigenstate.

So another way to write the eigenvector is [e^{i phi} cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]?

Wait, no. Because the direction n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, but the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so phi is zero.

Wait, but the eigenvector in the spin-1/2 system for a direction (theta, phi) is [exp(-i phi/2) cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Wait, but in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So the eigenvector simplifies to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)]^T.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the options include expressions involving e^{i phi}, which suggests that perhaps the general case with phi is being considered, but in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane.

But looking at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our conclusion.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like spherical coordinates but for a different parametrization.

Option D is sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), etc. Wait, but the eigenvectors should be normalized, so the components should have magnitudes squared adding to 1. So including hbar would give a magnitude, but eigenvectors are unit vectors, so I think the answer options that have hbar are probably incorrect because they would have a magnitude that's not 1.

Wait, in the problem statement, the options are labeled with things like sqrt(2/3) hbar, but in our case, the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), which are real numbers between 0 and 1. So perhaps the hbar in the options is a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but the eigenvector is a column vector with components that are complex numbers, but in our case, it's real. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which seems correct, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match our result. Our result is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D seems to have sqrt(2/3) hbar, but that's probably not right because the eigenvector should have unit norm. So if each component is multiplied by hbar, the squared magnitude would be (2/3 hbar^2) + (something) hbar^2, which would not be 1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector elements are being asked. Our conclusion is that the elements are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is option C.

So the correct answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as $\hbar/2$ times a 2x2 matrix. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parametrized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P}_n$
The operator $\vec{P}_n$ along the direction $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P}_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, and using the given forms of $P_x$ and $P_z$, we compute:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right)
\]
\[
\vec{P}_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\vec{P}_n \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting $\vec{P}_n$, we get:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This gives two equations:
1. $\cos\theta \cdot a + \sin\theta \cdot b = a$
2. $\sin\theta \cdot a - \cos\theta \cdot b = b$

Rearranging both equations:
1. $a(1 - \cos\theta) = b \sin\theta$
2. $b(1 + \cos\theta) = a \sin\theta$

From these, we find:
\[
a = b \cot(\theta/2)
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
To normalize, we compute the normalization factor:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \csc(\theta/2)
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived eigenvector and includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with normalized eigenvectors.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: Incorrect, as it does not match the derived eigenvector and introduces $\phi$, which is irrelevant since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane ($\phi = 0$).
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: Correct, as it matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: Incorrect, as it includes $\hbar$, which is inconsistent with normalized eigenvectors.

### Final Answer:
The normalized eigenvector is $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.
