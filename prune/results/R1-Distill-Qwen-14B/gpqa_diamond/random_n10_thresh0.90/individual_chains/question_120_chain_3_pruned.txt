Okay, so I've got this question here about the distribution of stars in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax, so d = 1/plx. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is 1 parsec away, and one with 0.5 parsec parallax is twice as far.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does the count change as parallax changes. Since stars are uniformly distributed, I think it implies that the actual number density in space is uniform, meaning the same number per cubic parsec everywhere.

Wait, so if stars are uniformly distributed, then the number per volume is constant. But how does that translate when we consider different parallax ranges?

Let me think about volume in terms of distance. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, right? So if you have a range of distances from d to d + dd, the volume is approximately 4πd² dd (since the change in radius is small, so the volume element is the surface area times the thickness). 

But wait, stars are in all directions, so maybe I should consider the volume as a function of distance. For a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be N = n * 4πd² dd, where n is the number density (stars per cubic parsec).

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, plx = 1/d. Let's substitute that in. So, d = 1/plx → plx = 1/d. So as plx increases, d decreases.

Wait, but looking at the number of stars per unit parallax range. Let's say we take a small change in parallax, d_plx. We want to find how many stars are in the range plx to plx + d_plx.

But since d = 1/plx, when plx increases, d decreases. So, the number of stars in that range depends on the density and the volume between those two parallax ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express in terms of parallax. Let's express the volume in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, the volume element in terms of plx would involve a change in plx and how that relates to the volume.

Let me think about the differential volume element. When plx changes by d_plx, d changes by d_d = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. So, d_d = -1/(plx²) d_plx.

Wait, but the volume element in terms of d is 4πd² dd. So substituting d = 1/plx, we have:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx²)) d_plx. Wait, that negative sign is because as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering
