Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres, and I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me try to think it through. Okay, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere depends on temperature, probably through something like the Boltzmann distribution.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to temperature. The formula I think is like the ratio of populations between two energy levels. So if E is the energy difference between two levels, then the ratio n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Oh wait, but wait, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So maybe the ratio of their excitation levels gives us some equation involving their temperatures.

Wait, wait, let me set this up. Let me denote the ratio of population in star_1 to star_2 as (n1_1 / n1_2) and (n2_1 / n2_2), but wait, no, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

In star 1, the iron atoms in a certain excited state are twice as excited as in star 2. So for a specific energy level, the number of atoms in that level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So the ratio n1/n2 = 2, where n is the population in that level for each star.

But according to Boltzmann, for each star, the population of that level relative to the ground state (or another lower level) depends on exp(-E/(kT)). But wait, in this case, maybe we're considering the same pair of energy levels in both stars. So for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the number in the lower state is given by Boltzmann.

Wait, the general formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights. But if the energy levels are the same for both stars, then g_upper and g_lower are the same for both. So that term would cancel out when taking the ratio between the two stars.

So for star 1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star 2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))
Taking the ratio of these two, (n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, but wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. So I think the ratio n1_upper / n1_lower is twice the ratio n2_upper / n2_lower. Wait no, wait. The problem says the excitation is twice as much, so maybe the ratio n_upper / n_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

But then from the Boltzmann equation, each ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait that's possible. Let me write that equation:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Hmm, maybe I can rearrange this. Let me take the natural log of both sides.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE)/(k T2)

Let me rearrange terms:

ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

But wait, wait. Let me check the signs. Wait, I have:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Because when I subtract the exponents, I get:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b), but I'm not sure. Let me recompute the equation.

Wait, I have:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = 2

Taking ln of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

So, (ΔE/k) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me double-check that.

Yes, 1/T2 = T1/(T1 T2), and 1/T1 = T2/(T1 T2), so 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, rearranging:

ln(2) = ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, the question asks for the equation involving T_1 and T_2. The options given are all of the form ln(2) equals something involving T1 and T
