Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let's see what the problem states.

Alright, we've diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, so the first thing to do is probably figure out the concentrations after dilution, right? Let's think about that. When you mix two solutions, you can use the dilution formula. The initial acetic acid solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution would be (volume1 × concentration1) / (volume1 + volume2). 

So, 0.05 M * 20 cm³ = 1 mmol (since 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol). Then, after adding 20 cm³ of water, volume is 40 cm³. So new concentration is 1 mmol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So, for the equivalence point, moles of acetic acid will equal moles of NaOH added.

But wait, what's the volume at equivalence? Let's calculate. The initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added. Let's see how much that is in moles. 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, since the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O, the moles of OH- added will neutralize an equal amount of CH3COOH.

So for the initial solution, we have 0.001 mol of CH3COOH. Adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH will convert 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH to CH3COO- (acetate). So the remaining CH3COOH is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, what's the total volume at this point? We started with 40 cm³, then added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.00
