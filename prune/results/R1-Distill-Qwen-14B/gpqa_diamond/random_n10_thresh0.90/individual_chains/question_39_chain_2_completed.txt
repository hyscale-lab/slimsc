Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave functions and normalization. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says we have a wave function given by (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. The particles can only be found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, no, actually, the problem states that when they measured, none were found at x<1 or x>3. So that implies the wave function is zero outside this interval, but the given wave function isn't zero except maybe when a certain condition is met. Hmm, maybe not. Let me read the problem again.

Oh wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. That's the form in the region where it exists. So that suggests that for x >=1 and x<=3, the wave function is this expression. But wait, the wave function should be zero outside this region, right? Because otherwise, the particle would have a chance of being found elsewhere. So perhaps this given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or maybe it's defined as zero outside, but the problem doesn't explicitly state that. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

But the main point is, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because that's the normalization condition, right? The total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that's a complex function. So when I compute the probability density, I have to take the modulus squared of ψ. 

Hmm, but wait a minute. ψ is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex number. So the modulus squared would be the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts. So |ψ|^2 = (a / sqrt(1 + x))^2 + (0.5)^2. Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part and -0.5i is the imaginary part.

Wait, no, because the imaginary part is 0.5i, so the coefficient is -0.5i. So the imaginary part is -0.5, but when I square it, (-0.5)^2 is 0.25. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

But wait, that's only if the wave function is in the region x=1 to x=3. Elsewhere, the wave function is zero, so their contributions to the integral are zero.

So the integral of |ψ(x)|^2 dx from -infty to +infty equals 1. But since ψ is non-zero only between 1 and 3, the integral becomes the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

So I need to compute the integral of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3, and set that equal to 1.

Let me break this integral into two parts:

Integral from 1 to 3 of a²/(1+x) dx + Integral from 1 to3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute these separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Because ln(4) is ln(2^2) = 2 ln 2, so ln4 - ln2 = ln2. So that's a² * ln2.

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So combining both, we have a² ln2 + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln2 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln2.

What's ln2? Approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me double-check my steps.

- The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

- When computing |ψ|^2, it's (Re)^2 + (Im)^2.

So (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

That's correct.

The integral from 1 to3: ∫ [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = a² ln(2) + 0.5.

Set equal to 1: a² ln2 + 0.5 =1.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

So that's how you find the value of a. So the answer is B.


The problem involves determining the normalization constant \( a \) for a wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), which is valid between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), and zero elsewhere. The wave function must satisfy the normalization condition:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since \( \psi(x) \) is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral reduces to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of \( \psi(x) \) is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \),
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \).

### First Integral:
\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

### Second Integral:
\[
0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
