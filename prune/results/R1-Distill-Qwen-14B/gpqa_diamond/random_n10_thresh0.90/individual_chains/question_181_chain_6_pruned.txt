Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll think through it.

The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch suddenly stops in the Sun's core, and we're supposed to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So the ratio is flux1/flux2.

Wait, what do I know about the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main way the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium. There are different branches. The pp-I branch is the simplest, where two protons combine directly. But pp-III probably involves more steps. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the intermediate step of forming deuterium via the 2H(e, e+)2p process. And this is one of the main contributors to the solar neutrino flux, especially for the 7Be and then 8B neutrinos.

Oh wait, the solar neutrino flux comes from several sources. The primary ones are the proton-proton chain, which mainly produces neutrinos from the decay of 7Be (the pep branch?), and the CNO cycle, which contributes less. But the question is about the pp-III branch stopping, so that must be about the 7Be neutrinos. Because the pp-III branch is responsible for producing 7Be, which later decays into 8B and emits neutrinos.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of 7Be would stop. Since 7Be has a half-life of about 53 days, right? Wait, but the question says the branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. That's way less than 53 days. So the 7Be would still be present, but no new production. So what happens to the neutrino flux?

Wait, the flux of solar neutrinos peaks in the 250-500 keV range, I think. The 7Be neutrinos have energies around 470 keV, but the question's bands are higher: 700-800 and 800-900. So maybe those are from other sources.

Wait, no. Let me think. The neutrinos from the Sun come in different flavors and energies. The BBN (Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) isn't relevant here. Oh, right, the main sources are:

- The pep branch (proton-electron-proton) of the pp chain, which produces 7Be, then 8B, emitting neutrinos.
- The main pp chain, which doesn't produce much in terms of high-energy neutrinos.
- The CNO cycle, which contributes neutrinos but at higher energies and in a different manner.

Wait, but another major source is the decay of 13C in the CNO cycle, which produces 14N and neutrinos. Those neutrinos are around 2-3 MeV, I think. But the energy bands in the question are 700-800 and 800-900 keV, so 0.7-0.9 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So that's in the same ballpark as the 13C neutrinos, but wait, 13C neutrinos are higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the 7Be neutrinos. Wait, 7Be decays into 8B, which emits a neutrino of about 0.47 MeV. So that's in the 470 keV range. So band 1 is 700-800, which is higher than that.

Wait, but the question says the pp-III branch stops. So if the pp-III stops, does that affect the production of 7Be? Because the pp-III branch is a part of the proton-proton chain that produces deuterium, which then goes on to form helium-3, and then combines with another helium-3 to make helium-4, releasing energy. The 7Be is part of the pep branch, which is a branch of the pp chain.

So if the pp-III stops, then the production of 7Be would stop as well, correct? Because the 7Be comes from the fusion of two protons via pp-III. So without that, the source of 7Be would stop, which in turn affects the 8B neutrinos. But the 8B has a half-life of about 53 days, so if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the 7Be in the Sun's core would still be present, but not being replenished. So the 8B production would continue for a while as the existing 7Be decays.

But wait, the question is about the neutrino flux reaching Earth. The flux is determined by the number of neutrinos emitted per second per area. So if the source is suddenly cut off, the flux from that source would drop, but the overall solar neutrino flux would be affected based on the dominant sources.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for a certain type of neutrino emission. Let's think about the types of neutrinos. The main sources of solar neutrinos are:

1. The pep branch (proton-electron-proton) of the pp chain. This produces 7Be, which decays into 8B and emits a neutrino.
2. The main pp chain (pp-I and pp-II?), which I think produces fewer neutrinos.
3. The CNO cycle, which produces 13C and 15O neutrinos.

Wait, but the CNO cycle contributes neutrinos in the ~1-10 MeV range, so higher energies than the 7Be neutrinos.

So if the pp-III stops, the production of 7Be would stop, which would affect the 8B neutrinos. But the 8B neutrinos are around 0.47 MeV, so that's lower than the bands in the question.

The question's bands are 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) and 800-900 keV (0.8-0.9 MeV). So higher than the 0.47 MeV.

Hmm, so maybe the question is referring to another source. Alternatively, perhaps the stopping of the pp-III branch affects the overall energy distribution of the neutrinos.

Wait, but the pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain. So if it stops, the Sun can't continue that part of the fusion. Oh wait, the pp chain is the dominant fusion process in the Sun, so stopping it would cause a problem, but in this scenario, it's only the pp-III that stops. So other branches might continue.

Wait, but the pp-III stops. So perhaps the production of a certain isotope stops, which affects the neutrino flux. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a certain amount of neutrinos. If it stops, the flux from that branch would drop.

Wait, perhaps the neutrino flux from the pp-III branch is a significant portion of the total. If it stops, the overall flux would decrease, but how does that affect the ratio of the two bands?

Alternatively, the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands. So perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for producing neutrinos in a certain energy range. So if it stops, the flux in that energy band would drop, but others may remain the same.

Wait, but the bands in the question are both in the same general energy range (0.7-0.9 MeV). So why would their ratio change?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch's stopping affects the production of a certain isotope, like 7Be, which emits neutrinos at a certain energy. So the flux in band 1 (700-800) might be affected, but band 2 (800-900) might be from another process. Hmm.

Wait, 7Be emits a neutrino when it decays to 8B. The energy of that neutrino is about 0.47 MeV (470 keV). So that's below band 1. So if pp-III stops, which produces 7Be, then the 8B neutrinos would decrease. But band 1 is 700-800, which is higher than 0.47 MeV. So maybe the neutrinos in band 1 are from a different source.

Another possibility: other processes in the pp chain. For example, the main pp chain produces 3He, which then combines to make 4He, but I don't think that produces neutrinos. Or perhaps the electron captures during the fusion steps. Alternatively, the 2H (deuterium) may emit neutrinos when it captures a proton and becomes 3H (tritium), which then decays.

Wait, the 2H captures a proton to form 3H, and that process emits a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is around 0.8 MeV. So that's right in band 1 (700-800 keV). Because 0.8 MeV is 800 keV. So if the pp-III branch stops, which is responsible for producing deuterium, then the production of 3H via 2H + p would stop. So the neutrinos from 3H decay would stop.

Wait, no. The pp-III branch is the branch where two protons fuse via the 2H(e, e+) 2p process. So that's the production of deuterium. So if pp-III stops, deuterium production stops. Then, the next steps in the pp chain that involve deuterium would also stop or be affected.

So the main pp chain (probably pp-I and pp-II) would stop because they rely on deuterium. But if pp-III stops, the production of deuterium stops, but the existing deuterium can still be used. However, over time, the deuterium would deplete, and the fusion would slow down.

But in terms of neutrinos, the 2H captures a proton to form 3H, which emits a neutrino. So if the production of 2H stops, then the production of 3H would stop as well. The neutrinos from 3H decay are about 0.8 MeV, so that's in band 1 (700-800 keV). So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 would drop, but what about band 2?

Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So higher than 0.8 MeV. Are there any neutrinos in that range? The CNO cycle produces neutrinos around 1-10 MeV. So that's higher than both bands. The 13C neutrinos are around 2.5 MeV, I think. So that's higher than both bands.

The 7Be neutrinos are at 0.47 MeV. So the 800-900 keV band would be in a region that's probably not covered by the main sources. Alternatively, perhaps there are other processes emitting neutrinos in that range. Or perhaps the question is considering the overall flux from all sources, but with a specific change.

Wait, but if the pp-III stops, the production of 2H stops. The main pp chain can't proceed as before. But the 3H neutrinos are at ~0.8 MeV, so if that's the source of band 1, then flux in band 1 would drop. But what about band 2? Are there other sources contributing to 800-900 keV?

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of 3H (tritium) are around 0.8 MeV, so band 1 is that. The CNO cycle's 13C neutrinos are at higher energies, so maybe band 2 has a negligible contribution from CNO. But if the flux in band 1 comes from the 3H decay, which is now stopped, then the flux in band 1 would drop to zero, while band 2 remains the same (assuming CNO continues). But the question says all other reactions remain as they were, so the CNO cycle is unaffected.

Wait, but the CNO cycle's neutrinos are at higher energies, so in band 2? No, 13C neutrinos are about 2.5 MeV, which is way above 0.9 MeV. So the 800-900 keV band (0.8-0.9 MeV) is perhaps from another source. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that if the pp-III stops, the main pp chain's 3H production stops, so the 3H neutrinos (around 0.8 MeV) stop. So the flux in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be lower, and band 2 (0.8-0.9) would have less as well, but maybe not as much?

Wait, maybe the 3H decay neutrinos are a peak around 0.8 MeV. So band 1 is up to 0.8, band 2 starts at
