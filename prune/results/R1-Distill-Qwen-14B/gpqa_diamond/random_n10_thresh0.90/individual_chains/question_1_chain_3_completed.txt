Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish between these two states. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle relating energy and time. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/(2π), but I think in some contexts, it's approximated as ħ. I might need to check that, but for now, I'll proceed with the idea that ΔE ≈ ħ/Δt.

The lifetimes given are the time uncertainties, right? So the lifetimes are Δt1 = 1e-9 sec and Δt2 = 1e-8 sec. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So which lifetime do I use for Δt?

Wait, perhaps the lifetime is the time during which the state exists, and during that time, the energy is measured. So the uncertainty in time Δt would be related to the lifetime. So each state has its own Δt. But how does that relate to the energy difference between the two states?

Wait, maybe I got this wrong. Let me think again. The energy difference between the two states needs to be resolved. So the uncertainty in energy must be less than the energy difference for them to be distinguishable. So the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state.

Wait, each state has its own energy uncertainty. So for each state, ΔE = ħ / Δt. So for the first state (Δt1 = 1e-9 s), ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (1e-9). Similarly, for the second state, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / (1e-8). Since ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s, let's compute these.

Calculating ΔE1: ħ/(1e-9) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J. Hmm, but we need to convert this to eV because the options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, divide by 1.6e-19.

So ΔE1 in eV: (1.05e-25 J) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.56e-7 eV. That's 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 is ħ/(1e-8) = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. In eV, that's (1.05e-26) / (1.6e-19) ≈ 6.56e-8 eV.

Wait, so the uncertainties are ΔE1 ≈ 6.5e-7 eV and ΔE2 ≈6.5e-8 eV. So the energy difference between the two states has to be bigger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps bigger than the larger uncertainty? Because the states are being measured together, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the energy resolution required is determined by the combined uncertainty. I think when you have two states, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties to be distinguishable. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, sometimes the minimum energy difference that can be resolved is on the order of the uncertainty of the measurement for each state.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. For these two states to be distinguishable, ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. But wait, each state has its own uncertainty. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the lifetime given is the time during which the energy is measured, so the measurement time is the same for both? Or maybe not. The problem doesn't specify, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states to be clearly resolved. So the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in energy.

Wait, the uncertainty in energy for a state is given by ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt). So for each state, the minimum ΔE needed to resolve it is about ħ/(Δt). So to clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference between them must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties?

Wait, perhaps the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty of the measurement. But wait, the measurement would be of each state's energy. So for E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1 ≈ 6.5e-7 eV, and for E2, ΔE2 ≈6.5e-8 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE = E2 - E1. For this to be distinguishable, it must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the larger of the two uncertainties.

Wait, let me think. In a measurement, if you have two nearby states, the ability to resolve them depends on the instrument's energy resolution. The instrument's energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in energy. So for the two states to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be larger than the instrument's uncertainty.

But wait, in this case, each state has its own uncertainty. So which uncertainty do we use? Maybe the maximum of the two, because if the energy difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty, then it's distinguishable. Or maybe the minimum.

Wait, let's think in terms of standard measurement. The energy resolution needed is such that the energy difference is bigger than the uncertainty in the measurement of the energy levels.

In this problem, perhaps the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, but the problem states that we have two states with their own lifetimes. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is determined by their respective lifetimes. So the energy difference must be bigger than the sum of the two uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the uncertainty for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than the maximum uncertainty between the two.

Wait, let's compute the uncertainties again. For E1, Δt1=1e-9 s, ΔE1= ħ/ (1e-9) = approx 6.5e-7 eV.

For E2, Δt2=1e-8 s, so ΔE2= ħ/(1e-8) = 6.5e-8 eV.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? No, I'm not sure. Because each state's energy has its own uncertainty. So the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the two uncertainties for the states to be resolvable.

Wait, that would make the minimum ΔE about 6.5e-7 +6.5e-8 = roughly 7.15e-7 eV. Wait, looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than that. Option A is 1e-9 eV, which is much smaller, so perhaps that's not enough. Option D is 1e-8 eV, also smaller than the required ~7e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between the two levels. Let me think again. Suppose the two states have energies E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. The energy difference is ΔE = E2 - E1.

To distinguish between them, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in the measurements. But the uncertainty in E2 is ΔE2 ≈6.5e-8 eV, and for E1 it's 6.5e-7 eV.

Wait, but the energy difference ΔE is E2-E1. So for the measurement to resolve them, ΔE must be greater than the sum of the individual uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each state's energy, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe a different approach. The lifetime of a quantum state is inversely related to its energy uncertainty. So a longer lifetime corresponds to a smaller energy uncertainty.

In this problem, E2 has a longer lifetime (1e-8 s) than E1 (1e-9 s). So the uncertainty in E2's energy is smaller. So the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, or perhaps the larger uncertainty.

Wait, but each state's energy is E1 and E2 respectively. If ΔE is the energy difference, then the measurement needs to have an energy resolution (ΔE_measurement) that is less than ΔE. But what is the energy resolution here?

I think the energy resolution is determined by the uncertainty in each energy measurement. So to measure the energies accurately enough to distinguish the two, the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty of the measurement.

Wait, but each state's energy has its own uncertainty. So if E1 has a larger uncertainty (6.5e-7 eV) than E2 (6.5e-8 eV), then the energy difference must be larger than E1's uncertainty, because otherwise, the two states' energies might fall into each other's uncertainty intervals.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me think: If E2 is at, say, E = 1 eV, and E1 is at E=0.99 eV, but the uncertainties are 6.5e-7 eV and 6.5e-8 eV, respectively. Then, the difference is 0.01 eV, but the uncertainty around E2 is 6.5e-8, and around E1 is 6.5e-7. So the intervals might not necessarily overlap.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of both states to be resolvable. So let's compute that.

Sum of uncertainties: 6.5e-7 + 6.5e-8 = approximately 7.15e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-7 → way smaller than 7.15e-7.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller.

C) 1e-4 → 1e-4 is 1e-4 eV → much larger than 7.15e-7.

D) 1e-8 → 0.1e-7 → smaller than 7.15e-7.

So the only option that is larger than 7.15e-7 eV is option C.

Wait, but 1e-4 eV is 1e-4, which is 100e-6 eV. 7.15e-7 is 0.715e-6. So 1e-4 is much bigger than that.

So if the energy difference is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the required 7e-7, then it's easily distinguishable.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me double-check the energy uncertainty calculations.

Calculating ΔE for E1 (Δt=1e-9 s):

ΔE1 = ħ/(Δt) → ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J.

So ΔE1 = 1.0545718e-25 / 1.602176634e-19 ≈ (1.05e-25)/(1.6e-19) = (1.05/1.6) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.656e-6 eV → 6.56e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2 (Δt=1e-8 s):

ΔE2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J.

In eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 = approx (1.05/1.6) * 1e-7 → 0.656e-7 eV → 6.56e-8 eV.

So the sum is 7.216e-7 eV.

So the energy difference should be larger than ~7e-7 eV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e-4 = 1e-4, which is much larger than 7e-7. So this would suffice.

Wait, but are the other options even in the ballpark? Option D is 1e-8, which is smaller than 7e-7, so no.

So the correct answer would be option C: 1e-4 eV.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) and the uncertainty in time (\( \Delta t \)) is approximately \( \hbar/2 \). For a quantum state with lifetime \( \Delta t \), the energy uncertainty is given by:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties for each state
- For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the energy difference required for distinguishability
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of the two states:
\[
\Delta E > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E > 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \), so it is also insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much larger than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 7.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only option that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**.

Answer: C
