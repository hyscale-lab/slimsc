Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain branch of reactions suddenly stops. Hmm. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, I remember that the sun's energy production involves several processes, and the pp-chain is a major one. The pp-III branch specifically is a part of the proton-proton cycle, right? So the question says that the pp-III branch stops, but all other reactions continue normally. I need to figure out how this affects the neutrino flux in two energy bands.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in different parts of the sun. The main sources are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp-chain produces more neutrinos but at lower energies, while the CNO cycle produces higher energy neutrinos. Oh wait, no, actually, the pp-chain produces lower energy neutrinos, and the CNO cycle produces higher ones. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I think the pp-chain neutrinos are around 1 MeV or so, but the CNO might produce higher. Or maybe not, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the pp-III branch is a part of the pp chain. So if it stops, what happens? The pp chain is the dominant source of solar energy, about 90% or so. So if the pp-III stops, that would significantly reduce the number of neutrinos produced from that branch. But how does that affect the overall neutrino flux?

The question is about the flux ratio between two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to determine how the pp-III branch stopping affects these two bands.

I think the neutrinos from the pp chain are lower energy. The pp chain produces electron neutrinos, specifically. The main process in the pp chain is the fusion of two protons into deuterium, which emits a positron and a neutrino. Then, in the pp-III branch, another proton fuses with the deuterium nucleus, producing helium-3 and a gamma ray, but I think that's not the main neutrino source. Wait, no, the neutrinos are from the initial step: each proton-proton fusion emits a neutrino. So most neutrinos from the pp chain are in the ~1 MeV range.

Wait, the pp chain produces neutrinos in the ~1-10 MeV range, but the majority are around a few MeV. The CNO cycle neutrinos are higher, like a few tens of MeV, but I'm not certain. So if the pp-III branch stops, the pp chain's neutrino production is affected. Because the pp chain is the main source of solar neutrinos, this would reduce the overall neutrino flux.

But the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands. So which band is more affected by the pp-III branch stopping?

If the pp-III branch is stopped, then the main neutrino production from the pp chain is reduced. The 700-800 keV band (band 1) is lower energy. Would the pp chain contribute more to this band? Or is it higher energy?

Wait, the main neutrinos from the pp chain are in the ~1-10 MeV range. So 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is lower than the typical pp neutrino energy. Hmm, that's confusing. Are there any neutrinos from the sun in that lower energy range?

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a certain type of neutrinos. Or perhaps the pp chain produces a broader spectrum. Let me think: the pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos compared to the CNO cycle. So the CNO neutrinos would have higher energies than the pp.

If the pp-III branch stops, the number of neutrinos from the pp chain would decrease, but the CNO neutrinos continue as before. So for the lower-energy bands (like 700-800 keV), which are dominated by the pp chain, the flux would drop. But the higher bands (800-900 keV) might be less affected because they are more from the CNO cycle.

Wait, wait. Wait, 800 keV is 0.8 MeV. The pp chain neutrinos are typically ~1-2 MeV. So the 700-800 keV band is lower than that. Hmm. Are there other sources of neutrinos around that energy?

Wait, perhaps the main pp chain neutrinos are around 1 MeV, so 700-800 keV is below that. So if the pp chain's main neutrinos are higher, then in the 700-800 keV band, the flux is mainly from the pp chain. But if the pp-III branch stops, which is a part of the pp chain, then that band's flux would decrease. The 800-900 keV band is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is just above 800 keV. So maybe the pp chain contributes a bit more to this band as well, but perhaps the CNO cycle's neutrinos start to contribute more at higher energies.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The pp chain's main neutrinos are around 1-4 MeV. The CNO neutrinos are higher, like 10's of MeV. So 700-800 keV is 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is way below the typical pp neutrino energy. So those neutrinos must come from the lower-energy part of the pp chain or perhaps another source.

Wait, maybe there's a part of the pp chain that produces lower-energy neutrinos. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the pp chain have a spectrum, with some at lower energies. Or maybe the 700-800 keV band is where the pp chain contributes, but the higher band is where both pp and CNO contribute.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, which part of the pp chain is it? Let me recall. The pp chain has several branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which leads to helium-4. The pp-II and pp-III are alternative paths. The pp-III branch involves the capture of a proton by a deuterium nucleus to form tritium, which then decays into helium-3. But wait, the neutrino emission in the pp chain occurs in the first step, where a positron and neutrino are emitted during the proton-proton fusion to deuterium.

Wait, no, the first step in the pp chain is two protons fusing into deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. That neutrino is what we detect. So that's the primary source of neutrinos from the pp chain. So if the pp chain's rate decreases because the pp-III branch stops, the overall rate of neutrino emission from the pp chain would drop.
