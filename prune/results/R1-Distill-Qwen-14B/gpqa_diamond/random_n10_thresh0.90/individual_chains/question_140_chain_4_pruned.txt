Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K, which I think is about 4°C because 273 K is 0°C. So if it's near 277 K, maybe B is something that melts just a bit above freezing. Wait, 277 K is 4°C, right? So what's a substance that melts around there?

The product of X reacting with a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Oh, and I'm supposed to find the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements' atomic masses in X.

Let me break this down. First, I'll focus on the reaction part to figure out what X and Y might be.

The reaction is violent, probably exothermic. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. If W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons, that would mean each atom in the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases.

Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. Helium? He is a noble gas, but He is monoatomic, but He has 2 protons, 2 neutrons (He-4 is the common isotope). So each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So the molecule He would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons each. If it's He gas, then W is He. But wait, He is monoatomic, so if W is He, then the molecule is He, with 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That fits the condition.

Alternatively, maybe it's another diatomic gas. For example, O2: each O has 8 protons. The neutrons would need to be 8 as well, making each O atom O-16. So O2 would have 16 neutrons per O, but wait, in each molecule, the total would be 16 protons (2 atoms * 8 each) and 32 neutrons (2 * 16 each). Oh, but the condition is that the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So 16 protons and 32 neutrons—no, that's not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, another way: maybe the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. So for example, each molecule has the same number of protons as neutrons. So for H2O, that's 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: H has 0, O has 8 (assuming O-16). So total neutrons: 8. 10 vs 8—no. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? No, that's not a gas, I think. Or maybe CH4? No, that's also a gas but let me think about the protons and neutrons. CH4 has 1 C (6 protons, 6 neutrons assuming C-12), and 4 H (each 1 proton, 0 neutrons). So total protons: 6 +4=10. Neutrons:6. So 10 vs 6—no.

Wait, perhaps W is CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons:6 + 16=22. Neutrons:6 + 16=22. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So yes, that would fit. So W is CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, right? At room temperature, it's a gas. So that could be possible.

But does CO2 have the same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule? Let's see: each C in CO2 is C-12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons). Each O is O-16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So each molecule has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. And neutrons:6 + 8*2=22. So yes, 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the condition.

Alternatively, maybe W is something like N2. Let me see: N has 7 protons. If it's N2, each N is N-14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons). So each molecule has 14 protons (2 atoms *7) and 14 neutrons (2 *7). So 14 each, which fits. So W could be N2.

Wait, but the reaction is between X and Y, which gives W and G. Let's think about possible reactions. If X is a metal and Y is an acid, it could produce a gas like H2, but that doesn't fit our earlier conditions. Wait, but if Y is water, maybe X is a metal reacting with water to produce H2 gas. But H2 has each H with 1 proton, 0 neutrons, so 1 proton each, 2 in total. So in the molecule, 2 protons, 0 neutrons. That can't fit the condition because protons (2) don't equal neutrons (0). So that's not W.

Hmm. Let's think of another possibility. Maybe W is CH4. Oh wait, earlier I thought about that. Wait, CH4 has 1 C and 4 H. C is 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Each H is 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So total protons:6 +4=10, neutrons:6. So 10 vs 6, no. Doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: maybe W is H2O. H2O has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons:2+8=10. Neutrons: O has 8 in O-16, so 8. So 10 vs 8, not equal. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps W is something else. Let me think about other diatomic gases. What about O2? Each O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). So each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, that works. So W is O2.

So if X reacts with Y to produce O2 gas, then maybe Y is some kind of peroxide or something that decomposes upon reaction.

Wait, but the problem states that X reacts with liquid Y. Let me think about metals reacting with water. For example, sodium reacts violently with water to produce H2 gas and sodium hydroxide. But that would give H2, which doesn't fit. So maybe Y isn't water.

Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid, and X is a metal reacting to produce CO2. For example, if X is calcium carbonate and Y is a strong acid, but that might produce CO2. Wait, but that's more of a decomposition reaction. Hmm.

Alternatively, thinking about group 1 metals. For example, Na reacts with water to produce H2. But earlier that gives H2, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, maybe producing CO2. But that's a possibility. But then the precipitate G would be something else, perhaps.

But let's think back to the precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So B is a solid that melts at just above 0°C. What's a common substance that does that? Maybe something like water ice? No, ice melts at 273 K (0°C). But 277 is a bit higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium carbonate decahydrate, but that's more about decomposition upon heating. Wait, another thought: maybe B is sodium hydroxide? No, sodium hydroxide is a solid but it's more like 450-something degrees for melting. No, that's not it.

Wait, perhaps B is something like ammonium chloride? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe B is a bicarbonate. Wait, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) decomposes upon heating to produce CO2, H2O, and Na2CO3. But the melting point of NaHCO3 is around 270°C, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is something like glucose? But that's a liquid. Hmm. Or maybe it's something like paraffin wax? No, that's way higher. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal. Wait, metals typically have higher melting points. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. If G is a precipitate, perhaps it's a metal hydroxide. For example, if X is sodium and Y is an acid, but that's not a precipitate. Or if X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid, producing a metal salt, water, and CO2. But then the precipitate would be the metal salt. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal nitrate and Y is something else. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution. For example, if X is a metal and Y is a salt solution, causing a double displacement reaction, forming a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and an acid. For example, sodium carbonate reacting with sulfuric acid to produce sodium sulfate, water, and CO2 gas. So sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O + CO2. In this case, W would be CO2. So that fits our earlier analysis that W is CO2.

So then, the precipitate G would be Na2SO4. But wait, sodium sulfate is soluble in water, so it wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, maybe that's not it. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution that forms a precipitate with X.

Wait, what if X is sodium and Y is a solution of a metal nitrate? For example, sodium reacting with copper(II) sulfate solution would produce sodium sulfate (soluble) and copper metal precipitating. But wait, sodium is very reactive. Alternatively, perhaps X is sodium metal and Y is water. Then sodium reacts with water to produce NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But H2 doesn't fit the W condition. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, going back to the possible W being CO2. So if X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Then the reaction would produce CO2. But then the precipitate G would be the salt of the acid. For example, if X is calcium carbonate and Y is hydrochloric acid, the reaction would give CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm. So maybe Y is a solution that when reacted with X produces an insoluble salt.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble sulfate when reacted with sulfuric acid. Wait, but that would produce a sulfate which may or may not precipitate. For example, if X is PbCO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction would produce PbSO4 (which is insoluble) as the precipitate G, along with H2O and CO2. That fits with W being CO2.

So in this case, X is lead carbonate. Then Y is sulfuric acid. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, and lead sulfate as a precipitate G. Then, when G (lead sulfate) is heated, it releases B. What's B here? Lead sulfate decomposes upon heating, but what does it produce?
