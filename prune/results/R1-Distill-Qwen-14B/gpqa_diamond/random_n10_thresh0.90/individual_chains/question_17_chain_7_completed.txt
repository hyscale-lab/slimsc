Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the concentration of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is Ca-EDTA. The problem gives the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. Oh wait, no, wait—I think in some contexts, the formation constant (Kf) is given, but sometimes people use the dissociation constant. Wait, the problem says KCa-EDTA is 5x10^10. I think in this context, K is the formation constant, Kf.

So, the problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Since the complex is 0.02 M, that's the total concentration of the complex. But the free calcium ions would be much less because the complex is very stable (since Kf is large, so the complex doesn't dissociate much).

I remember that when a metal forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free metal ion is given by the dissociation. The formula is [Ca²+] = (Kf * [Ca-EDTA])^(-1), assuming that all the EDTA is in the complex form and there's minimal free EDTA because of the high Kf.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formation of the complex is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

But in solution, the total concentration of Ca is the sum of free Ca²+ and the complex. But since Kf is large (1e10), the amount of free Ca²+ would be very small. So if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, then [Ca²+] is approximately (Kf * [CaEDTA])^(-1). But wait, let me clarify.

Wait, if the total concentration of Ca is 0.02 M, but the complex is the same as the concentration of Ca in the complex. Because it's a 1:1 complex. So [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

So, rearranging the Kf expression: Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

But EDTA in solution is in equilibrium with H+ ions. Oh wait, but the problem says the pH is ideal, so perhaps we can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is effectively the same as the total EDTA concentration. Or maybe, in this scenario, since all the EDTA is bound up into the Ca-EDTA complex, because Kf is so large.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The total EDTA would be the sum of free EDTA and the EDTA bound as CaEDTA^2-. But given Kf is 5e10, which is a very large number, the amount of free EDTA is negligible. So the majority of EDTA is in the form of CaEDTA^2-. So [EDTA^4-] is approximately [CaEDTA] times [Ca²+]/Kf. Hmm, but this seems like I'm getting into a loop.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it with the assumption that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the free EDTA, which may be negligible. But I'm not so sure. Wait, let me think of the total EDTA.

In the solution, the total EDTA (let's call it CT) is the sum of free EDTA (let's say [EDTA^4-]) and the EDTA bound as CaEDTA^2-. So, CT = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-].

But since Kf is very large, the [CaEDTA^2-] is much larger than [EDTA^4-}, so CT ≈ [CaEDTA^2-}. But wait, in this problem, the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. So, CT is approximately 0.02 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, that's the only speciation, right? Or is the Ca-EDTA complex a part of the solution, and the rest is free Ca²+ and EDTA?

I think I'm getting confused. Let me approach this systematically. The problem is that the solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA complex. So, [CaEDTA^2-} = 0.02 M.

The formation constant Kf is given as 5e10.

The dissociation reaction is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

We need to find [Ca²+}.

But we also know that the total concentration of EDTA is [EDTA_total] = [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-}.

But wait, in the solution, is there any free EDTA? Because if all the EDTA is in the complex, then [EDTA^4-} would be very small, but that's not possible because some EDTA is free.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make the assumption that the concentration of free EDTA is negligible compared to the complex. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed in a way that the [CaEDTA^2-} is 0.02 M, and the [Ca²+] is the only thing we need to find.

Wait, the question is about the concentration of calcium ions. So, considering that the Ca is either in the complex or free.

So, [Ca²+] = ?

The problem gives Kf =5e10 which is very large, so [Ca²+] should be very small.

Assuming that the EDTA is in excess (which it is, because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand and strong in forming complexes), so [EDTA^4-} is approximately equal to [EDTA_total], but wait, perhaps not, because some is tied up in the complex.

Wait, but in our case, [CaEDTA^2-} is 0.02 M. So, if the solution is 0.02 M in CaEDTA^2-, and the total EDTA is 0.02 M (because each CaEDTA is one EDTA), then [EDTA^4-} would be very small.

Wait, no. The total EDTA is the sum of [EDTA^4-] and [CaEDTA^2-}.

But if [CaEDTA^2-} is 0.02 M, and the solution is 0.02 M in CaEDTA^2-, then, what is [EDTA^4-}?

Wait, perhaps the total EDTA isn't given, but the solution is 0.02 M in the CaEDTA complex. So, perhaps the concentration of EDTA in solution is equal to the concentration of the complex, assuming all the EDTA is bound to Ca²+.

Wait, but that can't be right because the EDTA would come from a solution where you add both Ca²+ and EDTA. But in this problem, perhaps the solution is prepared by dissolving the Ca-EDTA salt, which would dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but if the Ca-EDTA is present as a complex, perhaps it's the only species. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is made by adding 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, no, the Ca-EDTA is a complex ion. So, when you dissolve it, it would dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But that would mean that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be equal, and the concentration of the complex would be zero. But that's not the case. Hmm, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the setup is different. Let me think of the solution as being made by adding Ca²+ and EDTA^4- into the solution, which then form the complex.

But in this problem, the solution contains 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So, perhaps the solution is 0.02 M in CaEDTA^2-}. Then, the dissociation is:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

So, the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

But in this case, since the complex is dissociating, perhaps the Kf is the same as the formation constant. So, Kf = 5e10.

So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then [CaEDTA} = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-} are variables.

Assuming that the solution is in a state where the only things present are the complex, free Ca²+, and free EDTA.

So, Kf = 0.02 / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

But we don't know [Ca²+] or [EDTA^4-}.

Wait, but if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the sum [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA} is the total concentration of Ca. But in the problem, the total Ca is 0.02 M (assuming the complex is the only source). Hmm, no, because the complex itself is 0.02 M, which contains Ca²+.

Wait, wait, perhaps the total concentration of Ca²+ in solution is 0.02 M because the complex is 0.02 M. But no, because some of the Ca is bound into the complex, and some is free.

Wait, no. The complex is a separate species. If I have 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-, then the concentration of Ca in that species is 0.02 M. So the total Ca in solution is 0.02 M (all from the complex), because any free Ca²+ would come from the dissociation of the complex. So, [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA} = 0.02 M.

But wait, no, the complex is a separate entity. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentration of free Ca²+ is [Ca²+}.

So, the total concentration of Ca²+ would be [Ca²+] + [CaEDTA} ] = [Ca²+} + 0.02.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the Ca in the complex is part of the complex, so the total Ca is [Ca²+} + [CaEDTA} ] = 0.02 M? Or is it that the complex is 0.02 M, so that's the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA?

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply that the solution has 0.02 M CaEDTA^2-}, and we need to find [Ca²+}.

So, assuming that the solution is 0.02 M in CaEDTA^2-}, and that the dissociation is governed by Kf =5e10.

So, Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

But to solve for [Ca²+}, I need to express [EDTA^4-} in terms of [Ca²+}.

Wait, but how? Because EDTA can come from the dissociation of the complex, so [EDTA^4-} = [Ca²+} because the dissociation produces one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, is that correct? Because each complex that dissociates releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So, in the dissociation equation:

CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-.

So, for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-}.

So, substituting into the Kf equation:

Kf = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}).

Since [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-}, this becomes:

Kf = [CaEDTA] / ([Ca²+]^2).

So, [Ca²+]^2 = [CaEDTA] / Kf.

Therefore, [Ca²+] = sqrt( [CaEDTA] / Kf ).

Wait, but wait. If Kf is the formation constant, which is large, then [Ca²+] should be small.

So, plugging in the numbers:

[CaEDTA} = 0.02 M.

Kf =5e10.

So, [Ca²+] = sqrt( 0.02 / (5e10) )

Let me compute that.

0.02 is 2e-2.

So, 2e-2 / 5e10 = 2/(5e12) )= 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) )= 2 * 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7.

So, 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, I thought Kf is given, and I used Kf in the denominator. So, 0.02 / 5e10 = 4e-13. Square root is 6.3e-7.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Another way: the formula is [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA} ] / (Kf * [EDTA^4-} )

But since [Ca²+] = [EDTA^4-}, then [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA} ] / (Kf [Ca²+] )

Multiply both sides by [Ca²+}:

[Ca²+]^2 = [CaEDTA} ] / Kf

So, same result.

So, yeah, [Ca²+] is sqrt(0.02 / 5e10 ) = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 ≈6.3e-7 M.

So, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex is represented as:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}.
\]

The formation constant is given by:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}.
\]

Since the dissociation produces one \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and one \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) per complex, their concentrations are equal: \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}]\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}]^2}.
\]

Rearranging for \([\text{Ca}^{2+}]\):

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \sqrt{\frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{K_f}}.
\]

Given \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M}\) and \(K_f = 5 \times 10^{10}\), we calculate:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \sqrt{\frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}}.
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
\frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Approximating \(10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7}\):

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.
