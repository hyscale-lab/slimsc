Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization. Let's think through each option.

Regularization, as I remember, is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are like infinities that pop up in calculations, which don't make physical sense. So the idea is to introduce a temporary 'cut-off' or some other method to make the calculations finite, and then remove the regularization in the end. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or maybe they have some other property that avoids such issues.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think string theory is supposed to be a theory that unifies quantum mechanics with gravity. Since it's a theory of strings vibrating, maybe it's a candidate for a theory that avoids some of the problems other quantum field theories have. But wait, I'm not sure if it requires regularization. I remember that string theory introduces higher dimensions and maybe some aspects that prevent divergences. Or perhaps it's that string theories are free from some types of divergences because of their structure, but I'm not certain.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that QCD calculations often require regularization because of things like loop divergences. But wait, QCD is a non-Abelian gauge theory, right? So I think that perturbative calculations in QCD do need renormalization and hence regularization. But wait, there's also the idea of asymptotic freedom, where at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling becomes weak, which makes perturbative calculations manageable. But does that mean regularization isn't needed? No, I think regularization is still necessary because the divergences are a part of the calculations regardless of the coupling strength. So QCD does require regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I definitely remember that QED requires renormalization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy, you get divergent integrals. So you need to regularize those. But wait, isn't there a way to handle this without explicit regularization? Or maybe regularization is a step before renormalization. So yes, QED definitely needs regularization. Wait, but I also heard that QED is a renormalizable theory, meaning all the divergences can be handled by a finite number of counterterms. But that doesn't mean regularization isn't needed. It's a part of the process. So QED requires regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, this is interesting. Classical theories don't involve quantum mechanics, so the whole concept of regularization, which is a quantum field theory tool, wouldn't apply. In classical ED, you don't deal with divergent integrals in the same way because you're not quantizing the fields. Or wait, does regularization apply to classical theories? No, I think regularization is a quantum concept. So classical ED doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same kind of divergences that quantum theories do. Wait, wait. But in classical electromagnetism, when considering point charges, you get issues like infinite self-energy and the so-called 'runaway problem' where the charge accelerates infinitely when you apply an external force. But wait, that's more of a problem in classical point charge theory. However, those are more like classical singularities, handled maybe by other methods, like considering distributions or smearing out the charges, but not regularization. So in the context of this question, which is about which theory never requires regularization, classical ED wouldn't need regularization because it's a classical theory. It doesn't use quantum field methods, so regularization isn't part of its framework.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. So how does that factor in? Well, regularization is used in quantum theories to deal with high-energy (UV) divergences. Classical theories don't have these issues because they don't involve the same mathematical structures. So the theory that doesn't require regularization at high energies would be the one that's classical, like option D. Because regularization is a quantum field theory technique, only the quantum theories would require it.

So let me recap. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So options A, B, C are all quantum theories, so they all might need regularization. Option D is classical, so it doesn't need it.

Wait, but wait a moment. Superstring theory is a quantum theory, right? Because it's a theory that tries to quantize gravity. So it would involve quantum effects and might require regularization. But then why would it not require regularization? Maybe because it's a theory that's background-independent or has some other properties that prevent divergences. Or perhaps because it's a theory that's not yet fully understood, and whether it needs regularization is unclear. Hmm.

Wait, I think I remember that in string theory, the concept of divergences is handled differently. In string perturbation theory, the calculations involve sums over diagrams with different topologies. But unlike in QFT, the perturbative series in string theory doesn't have the same kind of divergent loop integrals because the string propagators might cancel some divergences. Or perhaps they have a different structure that makes regularization unnecessary. Alternatively, some sources say that string theory is finite, meaning it doesn't require renormalization and hence doesn't need regularization. Oh, wait, if a theory is finite, it doesn't need renormalization, which implies that regularization isn't needed either. Because regularization is a step in the process of renormalization.

So if a theory is finite, like some versions of superstring theory (I remember that certain string theories are finite), then they don't require regularization. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps all string theories need some form of regularization when doing perturbative calculations. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So if a theory is free of divergences, it doesn't need regularization. I think that in some formulations, string theory is free of divergences, so it doesn't require regularization. But I'm not 100% confident.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the options again. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So the correct answer must be the one that doesn't have any divergences that need regularization.

Option D is classical ED. It doesn't use regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So at high energies, you don't need regularization because regularization is a quantum concept. So D would be the correct answer. Because the other options are quantum theories and require regularization.

But wait, the question is about high energies. Would classical ED require any form of regularization when considering high energies? Probably not, because it's a classical theory. So the answer is D.

Alternatively, could the answer be A) Superstring Theory? Because sometimes I've heard that string theory doesn't require the same kind of regularization as QFT. But I'm not certain. But the question is about which theory 'never' requires regularization. So if any of the options are a theory that's already non-divergent, that would be the answer.

Let me think about each option again:

A) Superstring Theory: Quantum theory, but perhaps doesn't require regularization because it's a background-independent theory and is finite. But I'm not certain.

B) QCD: Definitely requires regularization because of loop divergences.

C) QED: Requires regularization.

D) Classical ED: Doesn
