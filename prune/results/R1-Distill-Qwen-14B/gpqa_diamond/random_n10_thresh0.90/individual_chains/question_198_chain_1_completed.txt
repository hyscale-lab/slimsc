Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these stability constant questions. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ions attached, so that would be the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But I'm not 100% sure; maybe I should double-check that later.

Stability constants, right. The stability constant (β) tells us how stable a complex is. The higher β, the more the complex will form. So the complexes go from Co(SCN)_1, Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, Co(SCN)_4, with β increasing up to β3 and then dropping for β4. Wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). That's interesting. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ions.

But the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. I've heard that the different complexes have different colors, which is why they're used in colorimetry, like the cobalt thiocyanate complexes are used in the spectrophotometric determination of ammonia, as in the formation of the Co(SCN)_n complexes.

So, I need to find the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^2+ relative to all the other cobalt species. That means I have to consider all possible complexes and calculate their concentrations based on the stability constants.

Wait, the general approach here is to model the distribution of the metal ions into various complexes. The metal can form complexes with varying numbers of ligands. So Co(II) can be Co^2+, Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2^0, Co(SCN)_3^-, Co(SCN)_4^{2-}, or something like that? Wait, maybe the charges are a bit different. Let me think: each SCN- is -1, so:

Co^2+ + n SCN- → Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}.

So for n=1: Co(SCN)^+ (charge +1)
n=2: Co(SCN)_2^0 (neutral)
n=3: Co(SCN)_3^- (charge -1)
n=4: Co(SCN)_4^{2-} (charge -2)

Wait, but thiocyanate is a monodentate ligand, I think.

Now, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. The β for the first complex (n=1) is β1=9. So the formation of Co(SCN) from Co^2+ and SCN- is governed by:

β1 = [Co(SCN)] / ([Co^2+][SCN-])

Similarly, for the second complex:

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2] / ([Co(SCN)][SCN-])

And β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]/([Co(SCN)_2][SCN-])

And β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]/([Co(SCN)_3][SCN-])

Wait, that makes sense because each β represents the stepwise formation constant for adding an additional ligand.

So the overall formation constants for each complex would be the product of the β's up to that point. For example, K1 = β1, K2 = β1 * β2, K3 = β1 * β2 * β3, K4 = β1 * β2 * β3 * β4.

Wait, no. Wait, the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. So yes, K1=β1, K2=β1*β2, K3=β1*β2*β3, K4=β1*β2*β3*β4.

But wait, no, wait. The β values are the stepwise constants, so each β represents the formation of the next complex from the previous. So the overall K for Co(SCN)_2 would be β1 * β2, right.

So, the idea is to calculate the concentrations of each complex and the free Co^2+ and then find the fraction that is Co(SCN)_2 (the dithiocyanato complex).

But this could get complicated because the number of species is four complexes plus the free Co^2+. So five species in total.

The problem is to find the percentage of Co(SCN)_2 among all the cobalt species. So, the sum of all the Co species (free Co^2+ plus each complex concentration) equals the total Co concentration, which is 1e-2 M. So the percentages can be calculated by each species' concentration divided by the total, times 100.

But how to calculate each species' concentration? It's a bit involved because each complex formation depends on the concentration of the previous one and the ligand.

I think the approach is to model the system using the stability constants and the given concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN-.

Let me outline the plan:

1. Write the expressions for each complex in terms of [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

2. Use the stability constants to express each complex's concentration in terms of the next complex.

3. Find a way to express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, perhaps the free [Co^2+], and solve for it.

But given that the ligand concentration is much higher than the metal concentration (SCN- is 0.1 M, Co is 0.01 M), we can approximate [SCN^-] as constant, which should simplify things.

Wait, the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, and the metal is 0.01 M, so the extent of complexation won't consume a significant amount of SCN-. So, we can treat [SCN^-] as approximately 0.1 M throughout.

That's a helpful assumption. So, [SCN^-] ≈ 0.1 M for all calculations.

Now, let me define:

Let [Co^2+] = x.

Then, [Co(SCN)] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] = β1 * x * 0.1.

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co(SCN)] * [SCN^-] = β2*(β1 x 0.1)*0.1 = β1 β2 x (0.1)^2.

Wait, but wait, β2 is the stepwise constant from [Co(SCN)] to [Co(SCN)_2]. So the overall for [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 * β2 * x * (0.1)^2.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

The formation of [Co(SCN)] is β1 = [Co(SCN)] / (x * [SCN^-]) → [Co(SCN)] = β1 x [SCN^-].

Then, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2] is β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/([Co(SCN)] [SCN^-]) → [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co(SCN)] [SCN^-] = β2 (β1 x [SCN^-]) [SCN^-] = β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2] [SCN^-] = β3 * β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^3.

[Co(SCN)_4] = β4 [Co(SCN)_3] [SCN^-] = β4 * β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^4.

But wait, [Co(SCN)_3] would be β3 times [Co(SCN)_2] times [SCN^-], which is β3 * (β1 β2 x [SCN^-]^2) * [SCN^-] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^3.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)_4] is β4 times that times [SCN^-] → β4 * β1 β2 β3 x [SCN^-]^4.

So, all species can be expressed in terms of x and the β constants.

Now, the total Co is the sum of all these species:

Total Co = x + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4] = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

Substituting each term with the expressions in terms of x:

x + β1 * 0.1 * x + β1 β2 (0.1)^2 x + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 x + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 x = 1e-2.

We can factor out x:

x [1 + β1 (0.1) + β1 β2 (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2.

So, solving for x:

x = 1e-2 / [ 1 + β1 (0.1) + β1 β2 (0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 ].

Let me compute each term step by step.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Compute each coefficient:

Term1: 1

Term2: β1*(0.1) = 9 *0.1=0.9

Term3: β1 β2 (0.1)^2 =9*40 *0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6

Term4: β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3=9*40*63 *0.001. Let me compute:

9 *40=360; 360 *63 = 22680. Then 22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term5: β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 =9*40*63 *16 *0.0001.

Compute step by step:

9 *40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16= 362880.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So, sum all terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So, the denominator is 64.468.

So, x = (1e-2) / 64.468 = 1e-2 / 64.468 ≈ 0.0001551 M.

Wait, 1e-2 is 0.01. Divided by ~64.468, so 0.01 / 64.468 ≈ 0.0001551, which is 1.551e-4 M.

Now, we can compute each complex's concentration.

[Co^2+] = x ≈1.551e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)]= β1 *0.1 *x =9 *0.1 *1.551e-4 =0.9 * 1.551e-4 ≈1.396e-4 M.

Wait, wait: 9 * 0.1 is 0.9; 0.9 * x is 0.9 *1.551e-4=1.3959e-4.

[Co(SCN)_2]= β1 β2 (0.1)^2 x =9*40=360. (0.1)^2=0.01. 360*0.01=3.6. So 3.6 * x =3.6 *1.551e-4 ≈5.5836e-4 M.

Wait, no, because [Co(SCN)_2] is β1 β2 x (0.1)^2.

Wait, let me recompute each term:

[Co(SCN)] = β1 x [SCN^-] =9 *x *0.1= 0.9 x.

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co(SCN)] [SCN^-] =40 * (0.9x) *0.1 =40 *0.09 x=3.6 x.

Wait, that's another way to compute it, which might be simpler.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each concentration as:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) * (0.1)^n * x.

So, for n=0 (free Co^2+): x.

n=1: β1 * 0.1 *x.

n=2: β1 β2 * (0.1)^2 * x.

Wait, but I think the earlier approach is correct, but perhaps I should re-calculate all the concentrations using this approach.

Wait, no, perhaps the [Co(SCN)_n] is β1 β2 ... βn multiplied by (SCN-)^n multiplied by x.

Wait, for n=1: β1 * (SCN-)^1 * x → 9 *0.1 *x.

n=2: β1*β2*(SCN-)^2 *x →9*40*(0.1)^2 *x → 360 *0.01 *x →3.6 x.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 x →9*40*63=22680, multiplied by 0.001 (0.1^3) → 22.68. So 22.68 x.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4 x →9*40*63*16= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880. (0.1)^4=0.0001. So 362880 *0.0001=36.288. So [Co(SCN)_4]=36.288 x.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

n=0: x.

n=1: [Co(SCN)] = β1 * x * [SCN^-] =9 x 0.1 =0.9 x.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 * [Co(SCN)] * [SCN^-] =40 * (0.9 x) *0.1 =40 *0.09 x= 3.6 x.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 * [Co(SCN)_2] * [SCN^-] =63 * (3.6 x) *0.1=63 *0.36 x= 22.68 x.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 * [Co(SCN)_3] * [SCN^-] =16 * (22.68 x) *0.1 =16 *2.268 x=36.288 x.

So now, each concentration is:

x, 0.9x, 3.6x, 22.68x, 36.288x.

Wait, but wait, the sum of all these must equal 1e-2 M.

Wait, but we computed x as 1.551e-4, which gives:

n=0: 1.551e-4.

n=1: 0.9 *1.551e-4 ≈1.396e-4.

n=2:3.6 *1.551e-4 ≈5.583e-4.

n=3:22.68 *1.551e-4≈3.52e-3.

n=4:36.288 *1.551e-4≈5.62e-3.

Wait, let me compute each:

x=1.551e-4.

n0: 1.551e-4 → 0.0001551 M.

n1: 0.9 *1.551e-4=1.3959e-4 →0.00013959 M.

n2:3.6 *1.551e-4=5.5836e-4 →0.00055836 M.

n3:22.68 *1.551e-4 →0.003521 M.

n4:36.288 *1.551e-4 → apprx 36.288 *1.551e-4 = let me compute 36.288 *1.551e-4.

36.288 *1.551e-4 = (36.288 *1.551) *1e-4.

36.288 *1.551: 36 *1.551 is around 55.836; 0.288*1.551≈0.446. So total ≈56.282. So 56.282e-4 = 0.0056282 M.

Now, sum all these:

n0: 0.0001551

n1: 0.00013959

n2:0.00055836

n3:0.003521

n4:0.0056282

Adding them up:

0.0001551 +0.00013959 = 0.00029469.

+0.00055836 →0.00029469 +0.00055836 =0.00085305.

+0.003521 →0.00085305 +0.003521=0.00437405.

+0.0056282 →0.00437405 +0.0056282=0.01000225.

Which is roughly 0.01 M, which matches the total Co concentration. So that checks out.

Now, the question is about the percentage of dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2, [Co(SCN)_2] =3.6 x=5.5836e-4 M.

Wait wait, no. Wait, [Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6 x, which is 3.6 *1.551e-4 =5.5836e-4 M.

So, the total concentration of all Co species is 0.01 M.

So, the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is (5.5836e-4 / 0.01) *100%.

Compute that:

5.5836e-4 /0.01 = 0.055836.

Multiply by 100%: 5.5836%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are 42%, 25.6%, 38%, 16.9%.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, did I get the n=2 concentration correctly?

Wait, perhaps I confused the complexes. Maybe the dithiocyanato complex is the blue one, which is Co(SCN)_2^2+, but I thought it's n=2, but perhaps it's a different n.

Wait, no. n=2 would be Co(SCN)_2^0, which is neutral. Is that the blue one? Or maybe it's a different complex.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the colors come from different d-d transitions, so each complex has a different color. The blue one might be the one with a certain number of ligands.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the stability constants wrong in terms of n.

Wait, let me double-check the beta values.

Wait, the β's are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, the first complex (n=1) has β1=9, which is the first step.

So, the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- (β3=63), but β4 is lower (16) so the fourth complex is less stable.

But wait, when we calculated the concentrations, [Co(SCN)_4] is the highest, because β1*β2*β3*β4 is 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. So the product is very high, leading to a large [Co(SCN)_4].

Wait, but when we computed, [Co(SCN)_4] was 36.288 x, which is 36.288 *1.551e-4 ≈5.628e-3 M.

Wait, but that's about 5.6e-3 M, which is 0.0056 M.

But the total is 0.01 M, so the [Co(SCN)_4] is about 56% of the total. That would be a large percentage, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is Co(SCN)_2. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator in x.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator again.

Denominator D = 1 + β1*(0.1) + β1*β2*(0.1)^2 + β1 β2 β3 (0.1)^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 (0.1)^4.

So,

Term1:1

Term2:9 *0.1 =0.9 → sum 1.9

Term3:9*40 *0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6 → sum 5.5

Term4:9*40*63 *0.001= 22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum 28.18

Term5:9*40*63*16 *0.0001= 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → sum 64.468.

So, D=64.468.

x=1e-2 / D →1e-2 /64.468 ≈0.0001551.

So that part is correct.

[Co(SCN)_2] is 3.6 x, which is 3.6 *0.0001551= 0.00055836 M.

So, 0.00055836 M is 5.5836e-4 M.

The total Co is 0.01 M.

So, the percentage is (5.5836e-4 / 0.01) *100% ≈5.5836% %→5.58%.

That's about 5.58%, which is not matching any of the options.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I got the β's wrong. The problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, perhaps the β values are for the overall formation constants, not stepwise. No, the question says 'stability constants' which are usually the overall constants. Wait wait, but the problem says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16.'

Wait, stability constants are usually the overall constants, not stepwise. So perhaps each β_n is the overall K for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}.

Wait, that changes things. Because the way I approached it earlier was assuming stepwise β's, but if they're overall, then each β is the K for the entire complex.

Wait, so for each complex:

βn = [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ = β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^1.

For n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2.

Similarly, n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

Wait, that's a different approach. So if the β's are the overall stability constants, then each complex's concentration can be directly expressed as βn x (0.1)^n, where x is [Co^2+].

So, the total Co concentration is the sum of all the species:

Total Co = x + β1 x (0.1) + β2 x (0.1)^2 + β3 x (0.1)^3 + β4 x (0.1)^4.

Which can be written as:

x [ 1 + β1 (0.1) + β2 (0.1)^2 + β3 (0.1)^3 + β4 (0.1)^4 ] = 1e-2.

So, solving for x:

x = (1e-2) / [ 1 + β1 (0.1) + β2 (0.1)^2 + β3 (0.1)^3 + β4 (0.1)^4 ].

Wait, but using this approach, let's compute the denominator.

Denominator D:

Term1:1.

Term2: β1 *0.1=9 *0.1=0.9.

Term3: β2*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

Term4: β3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

Term5: β4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum all terms:

1 +0.9 =1.9 → +0.4=2.3 → +0.063=2.363 →+0.0016=2.3646.

So, D=2.3646.

Then, x=1e-2 / 2.3646 ≈0.004232 M.

Wait, that's [Co^2+] = x ≈0.004232 M.

Wait, but [Co^2+] can't be higher than the total Co concentration, which is 0.01 M. Because if x is 0.004232, then the sum of all species would be higher than that, but wait, let me compute each concentration.

Now, compute each [Co(SCN)_n] = βn x (0.1)^n.

n=0: x=0.004232.

n=1: β1 *x*0.1 =9 *0.004232 *0.1 =0.00038088.

n=2: β2 *x*(0.1)^2=40 *0.004232 *0.01=0.00016928.

n=3: β3 *x*(0.1)^3=63 *0.004232 *0.001=0.000026418.

n=4: β4 *x*(0.1)^4=16 *0.004232 *0.0001=0.000000677.

Now, the sum of all these:

n0: 0.004232.

n1: 0.00038088.

n2:0.00016928.

n3:0.000026418.

n4:0.000000677.

Adding all together:

0.004232 + 0.00038088=0.00461288.

+0.00016928=0.00478216.

+0.000026418=0.00480858.

+0.000000677≈0.004809257.

Wait, but the total Co concentration is 0.01 M, but according to this, the sum is about 0.0048 M. That's a problem. So that approach must be wrong.

Ah, so that suggests that treating the β's as overall formation constants leads to a sum of species less than the total, which is impossible. So perhaps the initial approach was correct, where the β's are stepwise.

But then why didn't that approach match any of the options?

Alternatively, maybe I swapped the β's. Perhaps the β's are the overall constants but the way I calculated the concentrations is wrong.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the [SCN^-] is not 0.1 M because some of it is tied up in the complexes. But earlier, I assumed that [SCN^-] is approximately 0.1 M because the metal concentration is much lower. But in reality, some of the SCN^- is consumed in forming the complexes.

Wait, but the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, and the metal is 0.01 M. So, the maximum amount of SCN- that can be tied up is 4 * [Co^2+] for each complex. So 4 *0.01 M =0.04 M. So the free SCN- would be 0.1 - 0.04 =0.06 M. But wait, that's the maximum if all Co is in the highest complex. However, in reality, not all Co is in the highest complex.

Wait, so the assumption [SCN^-] ≈0.1 M may not hold. Hmm, this complicates things. Because then, [SCN^-] is not a constant, but a variable, which depends on the extent of complexation.

That makes the problem more complicated, as it introduces another variable.

So, I need to model [SCN^-] as (0.1 - sum over n (n [Co(SCN)_n] )).

But that's a more complex system, perhaps requiring an iterative approach or the use of the approximation that [SCN^-] ≈0.1 M, which is accurate only if the sum of n [Co(SCN)_n] is much smaller than 0.1.

But earlier, when using β's as stepwise, we found that [Co(SCN)_4] was about 5.6e-3 M. So, 4 * [Co(SCN)_4] =4*5.6e-3=0.0224 M, which is less than 0.1 M, but not negligible compared to 0.1 M. So, 0.0224 is about 22% of 0.1 M.

Hmm, that's not negligible. So the approximation [SCN^-] ≈0.1 might not hold, and that could explain why the earlier approach didn't match the options.

But this complicates things. How can I handle it?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the stepwise β's as I did earlier, despite the approximation.

But then, why is the answer not matching any of the options?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the β's. Let me re-express the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the β's are given as the overall constants, not stepwise. So, for each complex, the β is the overall K.

So, for n=1: [Co(SCN)] = β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^1.

n=2: [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2.

n=3: [Co(SCN)_3] = β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3.

n=4: [Co(SCN)_4] = β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4.

So, the total Co is sum of all species:

x + β1 x [SCN^-] + β2 x [SCN^-]^2 + β3 x [SCN^-]^3 + β4 x [SCN^-]^4 =1e-2.

But [SCN^-] is not known. It's (0.1 - sum n [Co(SCN)_n ]).

Wait, but that's a system of equations with [SCN^-] as a variable. It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the assumption that [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which may not be entirely accurate but is a common approximation in such problems.

Let me proceed with that assumption, and see what I get.

So, using β's as overall K's:

Each [Co(SCN)_n] = βn x (0.1)^n.

Total Co: x [ 1 + β1 (0.1) + β2 (0.1)^2 + β3 (0.1)^3 + β4 (0.1)^4 ] =1e-2.

Compute denominator D =1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 →1.

9*0.1=0.9 → D=1.9.

40*0.01=0.4 → D=2.3.

63*0.001=0.063 → D=2.363.

16*0.0001=0.0016 → D=2.3646.

So D=2.3646.

x=1e-2 / 2.3646 →x≈0.004232.

Now, [Co(SCN)_2] = β2 x (0.1)^2 =40 *0.004232 *0.01=0.00016928.

So, [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00016928 M.

Total Co is 0.01 M.

So, the percentage is (0.00016928 / 0.01)*100 →1.6928%.

Which is about 1.69%, but again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the β's are stepwise, and the sum of the species is correct, but the question is about the Co(SCN)_2, which is n=2. So according to the earlier calculation, [Co(SCN)_2] is 5.5836e-4 M, which is 5.5836e-4 /0.01 =5.58%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which has two SCN- but is a different charge, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of ligands. Let me think: Co(SCN)_2^2+ would be if each SCN- is -1. So Co^2+ plus two SCN- would be Co(SCN)_2^+, charge +1. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, for Co(SCN)_2^0, neutral. So n=2, two SCN-.

So [Co(SCN)_2] is calculated correctly as 5.5836e-4 M, which is 5.58% of the total.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me recompute the denominator in the first approach (stepwise β's).

Denominator D was 1 +9*0.1 + 9*40*(0.1)^2 +9*40*63*(0.1)^3 +9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4.

Wait, no, in the initial approach, the denominator for x is:

1 + β1*(0.1) + β1β2*(0.1)^2 + β1β2β3*(0.1)^3 + β1β2β3β4*(0.1)^4.

So,

Term1:1.

Term2:9*0.1=0.9 → D=1.9.

Term3:9*40 *0.01=360 *0.01=3.6 → D=5.5.

Term4:9*40*63 *0.001=362880 *0.001=226.8 → D=5.5+226.8=232.3.

Term5:9*40*63*16 *0.0001= 362880 *0.0001=36.288 → D=232.3 +36.288=268.588.

Wait, earlier I thought D was 64.468, but that's incorrect! Oh no, I must have miscalculated earlier.

Wait, wait, let's compute each term accurately.

Term1:1.

Term2:β1*(0.1)=9*0.1=0.9 → sum:1.9.

Term3:β1*β2*(0.1)^2=9*40=360. 360 *0.01=3.6 → sum:5.5.

Term4:β1β2β3*(0.1)^3=9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 *0.001=22.68 → sum:5.5+22.68=28.18.

Term5:β1β2β3β4*(0.1)^4=9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288 →sum:28.18+36.288=64.468.

Ah! I see my mistake. Earlier, I thought term5 was 36.288 when I recalculated, but the sum is 64.468, which is correct.

So denominator D=64.468.

Thus, x=1e-2 /64.468 ≈0.0001551.

So,

[Co^2+]=0.0001551 M.

[Co(SCN)]=0.9 *0.0001551=0.0001396 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]=3.6 *0.0001551=0.00055836 M.

[Co(SCN)_3]=22.68 *0.0001551=0.003521 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]=36.288 *0.0001551≈0.005628 M.

Sum of all:0.0001551+0.0001396=0.0002947 →+0.00055836=0.00085306 →+0.003521=0.00437406 →+0.005628≈0.010002 M. So that's correct.

So the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.00055836 M.

Percentage is (0.00055836 /0.01)*100=5.5836%.

Hmm, but again, that's not matching any of the options. So perhaps I need to re-examine the question.

Wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Maybe I've mixed up the complexes. Perhaps the blue complex is Co(SCN)_4^2−, which according to our calculation is 0.005628 M. So, 0.005628/0.01=56.28%, but that's not one of the options either.

Wait, maybe the "blue dithiocyanato" complex is Co(SCN)_2^2+, which would have two SCN- ligands. But in our earlier approach, [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.000558 M, which is 5.58% of the total.

But no option matches that. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is the one with four SCN- ligands, not two. Because another possibility is that the blue color comes from the Co(SCN)_4^2- complex, which is the most stable as β3 is the highest (63) and β4 is 16.

But then [Co(SCN)_4] is 36.288 x=36.288 * 0.0001551≈0.005628 M, which is about 56% of the total. But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the first dithiocyanato complex, which might be a different one. Alternatively, maybe I have to consider that the problem is using the overall stability constants, not the stepwise.

Wait, let me try that approach again, assuming each βn is the overall K for the complex Co(SCN)_n.

So, for each n, [Co(SCN)_n] = βn x (0.1)^n.

Sum all [Co(SCN)_n] +x =1e-2.

Compute each term:

x: x.

n=1:9 x 0.1=0.9x.

n=2:40 x (0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4 x.

n=3:63 x (0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063x.

n=4:16 x (0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016x.

Sum: x +0.9x +0.4x +0.063x +0.0016x= x*(1+0.9+0.4+0.063+0.0016)=x*(2.3646)=1e-2.

So x=1e-2 /2.3646≈0.004232.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2]=40 x (0.1)^2=40 *0.004232 *0.01= 40 * 0.00004232=0.0016928 M.

So [Co(SCN)_2]=0.0016928 M.

Percentage = (0.0016928/0.01)*100=16.928%.

That's approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

Ah, so that makes sense. So the mistake earlier was in treating the β's as stepwise, but if they are overall stability constants, then the answer comes out to be approximately 16.9%, which is option D.

So why is this the case? Because when using overall β's, each [Co(SCN)_n] is directly calculated as βn x (0.1)^n, and their sum plus x equals the total Co concentration.

In this case, [Co(SCN)_2] is 0.0016928 M, which is 16.928% of 0.01 M, matching option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations. The total cobalt concentration is \( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \), and the thiocyanate concentration is \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \). The stability constants are \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), and \( \beta_4 = 16 \).

### Key Analysis
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constants (\( \beta_n \)) represent the overall stability of the cobalt-thiocyanate complexes. For each complex \( \text{Co(SCN)}_n^{2-n} \), the concentration can be expressed as:
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{2-n}] = \beta_n [\text{Co}^{2+}] (\text{SCN}^-)^n
     \]
   - The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:
     \[
     c(\text{Co}) = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + \sum_{n=1}^4 [\text{Co(SCN)}_n^{2-n}]
     \]

2. **Assumption for Ligand Concentration**:
   - Since the ligand concentration (\( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)) is much higher than the cobalt concentration (\( c(\text{Co}) = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)), we approximate \( [\text{SCN}^-] \) as constant throughout the calculations.

3. **Expression for Free Co\(^{2+}\)**:
   - Let \( [\text{Co}^{2+}] = x \). The concentrations of the complexes are:
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_1^+] = \beta_1 x (0.1), \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = \beta_2 x (0.1)^2, \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_3^-] = \beta_3 x (0.1)^3, \quad [\text{Co(SCN)}_4^{2-}] = \beta_4 x (0.1)^4
     \]
   - Substituting these into the total cobalt concentration equation:
     \[
     x + \beta_1 x (0.1) + \beta_2 x (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 x (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 x (0.1)^4 = 10^{-2}
     \]
   - Factoring out \( x \):
     \[
     x \left[ 1 + \beta_1 (0.1) + \beta_2 (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 (0.1)^4 \right] = 10^{-2}
     \]

4. **Calculation of Denominator**:
   - Compute the denominator:
     \[
     1 + \beta_1 (0.1) + \beta_2 (0.1)^2 + \beta_3 (0.1)^3 + \beta_4 (0.1)^4
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4
     \]
     \[
     1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Using \( x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \):
     \[
     x \approx 0.004232 \, \text{M}
     \]

6. **Concentration of Dithiocyanato Complex**:
   - The blue dithiocyanato complex is \( \text{Co(SCN)}_2^0 \), with concentration:
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = \beta_2 x (0.1)^2
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     [\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0] = 40 \cdot 0.004232 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.0016928 \, \text{M}
     \]

7. **Percentage of Blue Dithiocyanato Complex**:
   - The percentage is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2^0]}{c(\text{Co})} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.0016928}{0.01} \right) \cdot 100 \approx 16.9\%
     \]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option **D**.
