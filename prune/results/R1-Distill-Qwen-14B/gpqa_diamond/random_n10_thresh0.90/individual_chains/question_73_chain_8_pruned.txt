Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

First, the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. Oh right! Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add or subtract their velocities. I remember there's a formula for velocity addition in special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity, if one object is moving at u and the other at v relative to the same frame, is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). But wait, I have to be careful about the direction. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds divided by that factor.

Let me plug in the numbers. The first astronaut's speed is 0.6c, and the second is 0.5c. So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. Wait, but from whose perspective? Oh, right, in the rest frame, I think we can calculate the relative speed as the difference in their velocities, adjusted by the Lorentz factor.

So the relative speed v_rel would be (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c^2)).

Plugging numbers: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that narrows it down.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm, each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I think I need to calculate their energies separately and then add them.

The total energy E of a relativistic object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, velocity 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 2m * gamma1 * c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is E = gamma * m c². So for mass 2m, it would be gamma * 2m c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c²? Hmm, but wait, the mass is 2m, so m in the formula is 2m? No, wait, the formula is E=gamma * m c², where m is rest mass. So for the first astronaut, m is 2m, so E1 = gamma1 * (2m) c².

So gamma1 is 1.25, so (2m)*1.25 * c² → 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 2m is the rest mass, so E1 = (2m) * gamma1 * c². So 2m * (5/4) * c² → (2m)(5/4) c^2 = (10/4) m c^2 = 2.5 m c². No, that doesn't seem right because 1.25 multiplied by 2 is 2.5. So E1 is 2.5 m c².

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Gamma is 1.25 for 0.6c. So for the first astronaut, E1 = gamma * m_total * c². Wait, the problem says the masses are 2m and 3m. So m_total for each is 2m and 3m. So yes, E1 = gamma1 * (2m) * c².

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly, for the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) → 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * (3m) * c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So the total energy E_total is E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option B has E=4.96. So D is 5 mc², which is about 5, but our calculation is about 5.964. So option C is matching the energy.

Wait, but option C says v_rel is 0.14c and E is 5.96 mc². So that
