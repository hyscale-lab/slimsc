Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let's break each down.

First, I remember that the SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're derived from. The SM is based on Lorentz symmetry, right? So all the operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. That would mean option 1 is correct.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry the combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries? Since Lorentz is part of Poincare, if the operators respect Lorentz, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or are there more conditions? I think Poincare symmetry includes things like momentum conservation, which in a theory like SMEFT, which is a low-energy effective theory, might not hold in the same way because it's valid up to some cutoff scale. Wait, but SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it should respect Poincare symmetry as well. So both 1 and 2 are correct. Or maybe some operators could violate translations? No, because SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so translation symmetry (part of Poincare) must hold, so 2 must be correct as well. So options 1 and 2 are in, which would point towards either A or C.

Wait, but wait. Poincare symmetry is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if the theory already respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect Poincare? Or is there a separate requirement for translation symmetry? Well, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but it's also supposed to hold at lower energies, so translation symmetry is part of that. So yes, I think operators must respect Poincare, so 2 is correct.

Moving on to CP symmetry. I'm a bit confused here. The Standard Model is CP symmetric except for the CKM phase, which leads to CP violation. But in the effective theory, which includes higher-dimension operators, could those operators violate CP? Wait, no. The SMEFT is supposed to respect the same symmetries as the SM, except for those broken by the higher-dimension operators. Or wait, no, because SMEFT includes all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM. So the SM has some CP violation, but the effective operators can also have CP violation, right? For example, operators that are odd under CP would be allowed if the SM itself has CP violation. So in the SMEFT, operators can violate CP, but the SM itself doesn't have a lot of CP violation except for the CKM. Wait, no, the effective operators can also have CP violation. So the question is, must all operators respect CP symmetry? Or can they violate it? From what I remember, SMEFT allows for operators that are not CP-symmetric, so CP isn't necessarily a symmetry that must be respected. So statement 3 is not necessarily correct.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. I think CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in theories with Lorentz symmetry. Because all the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, which implies that they must also respect CPT symmetry. Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT is a symmetry. So if the operators are to respect Lorentz, they must also respect CPT. So statement 4 must be correct.

So putting it all together: which symmetries must all operators respect?

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Yes.
2. Poincare symmetry: Yes.
3. CP symmetry: No, because operators can violate it.
4. CPT symmetry: Yes.

So the operators must respect 1, 2, and 4. Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. But wait, looking again at the options:

Options are:

A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

Wait, so option C is 1,2,4. So yes, that seems correct.

But wait, earlier I thought Poincare is automatically respected because Lorentz is part of it. But the actual requirement is that operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So the correct answer would include 1,2,4.

So the correct option is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) and higher-dimensional operators. All operators in SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the underlying SM, which includes Lorentz symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is fundamental in SMEFT, so all operators must respect it. 

Poincaré symmetry, which combines Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry, is also automatically respected in SMEFT because the theory is Lorentz-invariant and translation symmetry is part of the framework. Therefore, Poincaré symmetry must be respected by all operators.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not necessarily respected by all operators in SMEFT. The SM already allows for some CP violation (e.g., through the CKM phase), and SMEFT can include operators that explicitly violate CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

CPT symmetry, however, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theory, especially in Lorentz-invariant theories like SMEFT. Since all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT symmetry.

In conclusion, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
