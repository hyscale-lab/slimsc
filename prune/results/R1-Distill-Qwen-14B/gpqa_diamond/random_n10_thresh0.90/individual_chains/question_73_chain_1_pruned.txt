Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me try to think this through.

Alright, the problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just subtract directly because of the relativistic effects. So if I want to find the relative speed of one astronaut from the other's frame, I can't just do 0.6c - 0.5c. That would give 0.1c, but I think relativistic velocity addition is different.

Wait, right! The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, no, wait—actually, the formula for the velocity of an object as seen from another frame is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the object in the original frame and v is the velocity of the moving frame. So in this case, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c in the same direction, to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, I should plug u as B's speed (0.5c) and v as A's speed (0.6c), since A's frame is moving at 0.6c relative to the original frame.

So let's compute that. u = 0.5c, v = 0.6c.

v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) ) = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)].

Calculating numerator: 0.5c -0.6c = -0.1c. But since we're talking relative speed, the magnitude is 0.1c. Wait, but wait, the denominator: 0.5*0.6= 0.3, so 0.3 c² divided by c² is 0.3. So denominator becomes 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.142857c. The negative sign just indicates direction, so the speed is 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². Option D also has 0.14c but E=5 mc². So the relative speed part is probably 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. For each astronaut, their total energy is gamma times their rest energy. So E_total would be gamma1 * m1 c² + gamma2 * m2 c².

Wait, the masses are 2m and 3m. So:

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
