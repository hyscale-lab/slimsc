Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, right, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So that means they form an orthonormal basis for the spin-½ system. 

The question has two parts: first, calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is A_ij. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would mean the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. Let me write that matrix out: 

A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the eigenstates of A. So the operator A has eigenstates. Let's think: since A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x. For sigma_x, the eigenstates are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So they're superpositions of |up> and |down>... I think. 

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Or wait, I might have the signs mixed. Let me recall: the spin-up in x direction is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and spin-down is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) multiplied by i or something? Not sure, but for the purposes of calculating probabilities, the exact phase might not matter since probabilities involve squares of magnitudes.

So the problem is to find the probability of measuring the electron in each eigenstate (the two eigenstates) of A when the state is |alpha>. Also, find the average value of that operator.

Wait, okay, the first step is to normalize |alpha> because it's given as proportional. So |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let's compute the norm to find the normalization factor.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Wait, because |a|^2 + |b|^2 for a state a|up> + b|down>. So (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 =2, since (a)(a*) where a=1+i. 1+i multiplied by its conjugate 1-i is (1)(1)+(1)(-i)+(i)(1)+(i)(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². The i terms cancel, and -i² is +1, so 1 +1=2. Similarly, (2-i)(2+i) is 4 +2i -2i + (i²*(-1))= 4 + ( (2i -2i) ) + (-1) because i² is -1. Wait, wait, (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i -2i - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5? Because (a-b)(a+b)=a² - b². So 2² - (i)^2 =4 - (-1)=5. So the norm squared is 2 +5=7. So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of A. The eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which I mentioned earlier. Let me write them out:

|+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2) ? Or maybe the other way around with a phase. Wait, let me check. The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down> ) and (|up> - |down> ), but I think I need to include an i somewhere. Oh wait, the exact form might have a phase factor. Let me think: sigma_x |+x> = |+x>. Let me compute sigma_x on |+x>.

sigma_x |+x> = [[0,1],[1,0]] * (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 1] = (1/sqrt(2)) [1; 1] = |+x>, so yes, that's correct. So the eigenstates are as I wrote.

So to find the probability of measuring |+x> when in state |alpha>, I need to compute the inner product < +x | alpha >, then take the square of the magnitude.

Similarly for |-x>.

But wait, |alpha> is in the |up> and |down> basis, and |+x> is expressed in that basis. So let's compute the inner products.

First, |+x> = (|up> + |down> ) / sqrt(2). So the inner product with |alpha> is:

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | + < down | ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2-i) <down|up> + ... ] Wait, no, more accurately, <up| multiplied by (1+i)|up> is (1+i) * 1, and similarly for the others.

Wait, the inner product is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) * 1/sqrt(7) + (2-i) * 1/sqrt(7) ) ] * 1/sqrt(2)?

Wait, perhaps better to compute it as:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) (1/sqrt(7)) ) + (2 -i) (1/sqrt(7)) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me write it step by step.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * [
