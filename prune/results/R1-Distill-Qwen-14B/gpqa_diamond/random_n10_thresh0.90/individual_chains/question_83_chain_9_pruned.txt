Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration changes, which affects the pH. Then, titrating it with a strong base like NaOH will lead to different pH conditions at various points.

First, I think I should calculate the new concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate. When we mix equal volumes, the concentration should be halved because the volume doubles. So, initial concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acid, the total volume is 40 cm³. So new concentration is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, no. Wait. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Adding 20 cm³ of water makes the total volume 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Right.

So now, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Let me find the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = concentration × volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait, the diluted solution is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Oh, same as before because the initial 20 cm³ was 0.05 M, which is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. So the moles are the same because we're just diluting it.

Wait, but when you add water, the total moles of acetic acid remain the same, right? So yes, 0.001 moles.

When titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when n(NaOH) equals n(acetic acid). So n = 0.1 M * V = 0.001 moles. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no. 25% titration means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So, at 25% titration, the NaOH added is 25% of the equivalence point volume. So, yes, 2.5 cm³. Because at equivalence, 10 cm³ is added. So 2.5 cm³ is 25% of that.

Alternatively, another approach is to calculate moles. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH.

So, the solution at 25%
