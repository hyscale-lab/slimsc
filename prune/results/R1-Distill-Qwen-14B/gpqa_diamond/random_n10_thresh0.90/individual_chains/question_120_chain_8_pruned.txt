Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The farther away a star is, the smaller its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, but wait, in what units? I think it's parsecs. So, distance in parsecs, parallax in arcseconds. Yeah, right: plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So if a star is 10 parsecs away, it has a parallax of 0.1 arcseconds.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Oh, so how does the number of stars change with plx? The options are different power laws, like 1/plx^4, etc.

I think I need to model the distribution. Let's think about a volume of space. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on that volume.

But wait, what's the relation between parallax and distance? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, so distance d = 1/plx.

Now, let's think about a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² dr. But wait, since we're looking at parallax, we can express this in terms of plx. Since d = 1/plx, then dr is the change in distance, but we need to relate it to the change in parallax, let's say dplx.

Hmm, let's see. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by a small amount dplx, that means d decreases. The derivative of d with respect to plx would be dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So, dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. Wait, but since we're dealing with a small change, maybe the negative sign just indicates the direction, but for the differential, we can ignore the sign and just take the absolute value.

So, the volume element in terms of parallax would be 4π (d)^2 dr. Substituting d = 1/plx and dr = -(1/plx^2) dplx, but taking absolute value, dr = (1/plx^2) dplx. Wait, no, when plx increases, d decreases. So for a small
