Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is about finding the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. So, Li-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. Right, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons.

The problem is asking for the energy of the collider. I remember from my studies that when dealing with relativistic particles, the energy isn't just the kinetic energy but the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh wait, but sometimes the question specifies whether it wants kinetic energy or total energy. The question here says "energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the total energy of the nucleus. RHIC accelerators typically deal with high-energy particles, so relativistic effects are significant here.

Let me think about the formulas. The total energy E of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma first.

Calculating gamma: v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. Let me calculate 0.0784 squared correctly. Wait, no, no, wait: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly because 0.28 * 0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is exactly 1/0.28, which is 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus X. X is Li-6, so I need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Wait, the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, the exact value might be more precise. Let me recall: proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But for a nucleus, I should also consider binding energy. Wait, but the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the binding energy (mass defect). But for heavy ions like this, the binding energy is a significant fraction of the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of the Li-6 nucleus as a given value. But I'm not provided with that. Hmm. Maybe I can calculate it. Oh wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that each nucleon's rest mass is about 1 GeV. But let me think again: 938 MeV is approximately 0.938 GeV. So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, the rest mass would be 6 * 0.938 GeV. Wait, but that's without considering the binding energy. Oh, but if I'm given that the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and I need to calculate the relativistic energy, perhaps the problem wants me to use the rest mass as 6 times the mass of a nucleon, each approximated as 1 GeV/c², but that might not be precise.

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact mass of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number as the approximate mass in GeV/c². Let me think: the mass of a single proton is about 0.938 GeV/c², neutron is about 0.939 GeV/c². So the mass of Li-6 is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me compute that:

3 * 0.938 (protons) + 3 * 0.939 (neutrons) = 3*(0.938 + 0.939) = 3*(1.877) = 5.631 GeV/c². But wait, that's without considering the binding energy. Li-6 has a binding energy, so the actual mass would be less. But considering that the binding energy per nucleon is about a few MeV. For light nuclei like Li-6, the binding energy is around 2-3 MeV per nucleon. Wait, let's see: for example, for carbon-12, the binding energy is about 12 * 2.26 MeV = ~27 MeV. So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, perhaps the binding energy is around 6 * 2 MeV = 12 MeV, which is 0.012 GeV. So the total mass would be 5.631 GeV - 0.012 GeV = approximately 5.619 GeV/c².

But wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the problem expects me to ignore the binding energy and simply take the mass as 6 * 0.938 GeV. Let's compute that:
