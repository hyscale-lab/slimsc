Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's a lithium isotope. 

Wait, lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

I remember that in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we need to use the gamma factor. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m*c². But wait, in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often specified. Hmm, does the question ask for the total energy or the kinetic energy? The problem says "energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." I think RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain kinetic energy. Or maybe it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The RHIC's energy is usually given as the kinetic energy per nucleon or per ion. But I'm not sure. Let me think. The question is phrased as the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c. So perhaps it's considering the total energy, since that depends on the gamma factor. Or maybe it's the kinetic energy.

Wait, to clarify: Kinetic energy (K) is (gamma -1) * m c², while total energy is gamma * m c². So which one is the question asking for? The problem says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." I think RHIC's energy is usually the kinetic energy imparted to the ions, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total energy. Hmm.

But let's figure it out. Let's first find gamma for v = 0.96c.

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So plugging v = 0.96c, v² = 0.9216 c². 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.0784: let me see, sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly, right? 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So yes, sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/(0.28) = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus is needed. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Since Li-6 has 6 nucleons (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total rest mass energy is 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

But wait, the rest mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6 times the mass of a proton because of binding energy, but I think for this problem, we approximate it as 6 * 938 MeV. Because otherwise, it's too complicated and probably beyond the scope. So yes,
