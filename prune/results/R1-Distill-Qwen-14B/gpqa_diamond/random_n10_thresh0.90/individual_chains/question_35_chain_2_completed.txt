Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators have specific forms, especially in spin systems.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. The matrix Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, so the matrix S looks familiar. Oh right, S must be related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are 2x2, and sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is sigma_y. So Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can compute its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let me write it out:

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
       [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

The eigenvalues of a matrix M are found by solving det(M - a I) = 0. So for Ay, the matrix M - a I is:

[[-a, -i*(h/(4π))],
[ i*(h/(4π)), -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))*(i*(h/(4π)) ) ].

Calculating that: a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ].

Wait, (-i)*(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - [ (h²/(16 π²)) * 1 ].

Set the determinant to zero: a² - (h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Let's double-check. Wait, the determinant is (0 - a)(0 - a) - ( (-i c) (i c) ), where c is h/(4π). So:

= a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ] 
= a² - [ (-i^2) c² ]
= a² - [ ( -(-1) ) c² ] 
= a² - ( (1) c² )
= a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a= ±c.

Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, let me think. Is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, S is sigma_y, which is Hermitian because sigma_y^dagger = sigma_y. Because the (1,2) element is -i, and (2,1) is i. Taking the conjugate transpose, the (1,2) becomes i, and (2,1) becomes -i, which is the same as the original. So S is Hermitian. Then Ay = c S, so it's also Hermitian since c is real. So the eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where I thought the determinant had a term leading to a complex number. Oh wait no, because the determinant calculation led to a² = c², so a is real.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). That's real. So the eigenvalues don't have an imaginary part. So looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or something, but that can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So A is out.

Option B talks about imaginary parts as ±1/2 and real parts as ±1. That also doesn't fit because our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real.

So the correct eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting imaginary parts in the eigenvalues is wrong. So options A and B can be eliminated.

Now looking at the other options. Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, for angular momentum operators, the square of the operator A² commutes with each component. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, then it's also an eigenstate of A². Because [A², A_y] =0, so they share eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C's first part is correct. What about Az? Well, since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So a state that is an eigenfunction of Ay may not be an eigenfunction of Az. So the statement in C is correct: eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So C could be the correct option.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not exactly sure what that means. But for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) would form a basis for the space. So if the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors (if they are two and linearly independent) form a basis. So D could be correct.

Wait, but the real question is which statements are correct during the calculation. So when calculating eigenvalues, the key points are whether the eigenvalues are real, and whether the eigenvectors form a basis.

Let me think again about the options. Since in the calculation, Ay is a 2x2 matrix with real eigenvalues, the eigenvectors will form a basis for the space. So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That makes sense because any 2x2 matrix has eigenvectors that can form a basis (assuming they are diagonalizable, which in this case they are because the eigenvalues are distinct).

Wait, the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π), which are distinct. So Ay is diagonalizable, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options. Option D says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) are the basis. So that is correct because for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis.

So when calculating, D is a correct statement.

Wait, but let's look at the options again. The question is during the calculation, which statement will you consider correct.

So which of the options are correct based on what I calculated.

Option C says eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. Since A^2 is a scalar operator, it commutes with Ay, so any eigenfunction of Ay is also eigenfunction of A^2. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator, which is correct because for a 2x2 operator with two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors form a basis.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So, during the calculation, when I find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which statements are correct.

So which of the options are correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. Correct.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. Correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So it's possible that more than one option could be correct, but looking at the options, I need to see whether each option is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, I think the correct answer is D, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me reevaluate the options.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. However, Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Yes, because the operator is a 2x2 matrix, so the eigenvectors are in a 2-dimensional space, and two eigenvectors (if distinct) form a basis.

So both C and D seem correct. But wait, the options are in a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but which one is among the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Option C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both are correct statements. But that's not possible because it's a multiple-choice question.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the options. Let me recheck.

Wait, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π), which are real. So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest imaginary parts in the eigenvalues.

So the correct options are either C or D.

So, which is correct? Let me think about what the question is asking. The question is during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, which statement is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That's correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². However, since Az and Ay don't commute (they are different components of angular momentum), their eigenstates are different.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix (with two distinct eigenvalues) form a basis, D is correct.

Wait, but the question is phrased as which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me think about the Pauli matrices. The eigenvectors of sigma_y are standard basis functions. For sigma_y, the eigenvalues are ±1. The eigenvectors are (1, i)/sqrt(2) and (1, -i)/sqrt(2). So yes, they form a basis. So the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

Hmm, but in the options, the correct statements would be C and D. But since only one option is correct, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, but it's possible that option C is also correct because it's a true statement.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct. Since both C and D could be correct, but looking at the problem again, perhaps the correct answer is C. But I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D. Let me think about the matrix Ay. Its eigenvectors are the eigenfunctions φ, which are the basis functions for the operator. So when you diagonalize Ay, these φs form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

So looking back, options C and D could be correct. But I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, the question is during the calculation, which statement is correct. So when you calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay, you find that the eigenvectors form a basis for the space (so D is correct), and the eigenvectors are also eigenfunctions of A² (so C is correct).

But since the options are separate, I have to pick the correct one. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh etc. → incorrect.

B) Imaginary parts ±1/2 → incorrect.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not Az → correct.

D) Eigenfunctions are basis functions → correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the question is about which statement you will consider correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait: the question is which statement is correct. So the statements in the options may have some issues.

Another way to think: since the eigenfunctions form a basis (D), which is correct, and also A² commutes with Ay, hence (C) is correct.

But perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a fundamental property of operators.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is C. Hmm.

I think I'm getting stuck. So perhaps the correct answer is D because it's a true statement. So I'll go with D.


The problem involves analyzing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is proportional to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), which is Hermitian. Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), \( A_y \) is also Hermitian, meaning its eigenvalues are real.
   - The eigenvalues of \( S \) are \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest eigenvalues with imaginary parts, which contradicts the Hermitian nature of \( A_y \).

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional space since \( A_y \) is a 2×2 matrix with distinct eigenvalues. Thus, option D is correct.

3. **Relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - The operator \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_z \) does not commute with \( A_y \), so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \). Thus, option C is correct.

4. **Final Decision:**
   - Both options C and D are correct based on the analysis. However, since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, the focus is on the properties directly relevant to the eigenvalue problem. Option D emphasizes the role of eigenvectors as basis functions, which is a fundamental aspect of the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **D**, as it directly addresses the role of eigenvectors in forming a basis for the operator \( A_y \).

Answer: D
