Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm. Let's read it again carefully.

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh wait, so the excitation is higher in star_1. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I need to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2.

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor gives the ratio of populations in two energy states. The formula is something like n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) )

Wait, but the problem says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for the same energy level, the population of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So the proportion is (n1/n2) = 2.

Assuming that the ground state is much more populated, but perhaps in this case, the ratio is given for the same transition. So for the same two levels, the ratio of their populations in star_1 and star_2 is 2.

So the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: n2_upper / n2_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So perhaps n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper /n2_lower) ?

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the ratio of excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2. So n1/n2 = 2. Let me define the ratio as (n_upper / n_lower) for each star.

So (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower)

But from the Boltzmann equation, each ratio equals (g/g) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming the levels' statistical weights g are the same for both stars, since it's the same element. So g_upper / g_lower is the same for both stars.

So:

(n1_upper/n1_lower) / (n2_upper/n2_lower) ) = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

But since (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower), that ratio is 2. So:

2 = exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ]

Taking natural logarithm on both sides:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's a familiar number. 1.38 is close to k, the Boltzmann constant which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, so ΔE = k * T * something? Let me think.

The Boltzmann equation relates the energy difference to temperature. Let's compute ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. Wait, that cancels out. So ΔE = k * (something), yes.

So ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. And k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * something.

Wait, ΔE = k * (1.0) * something? Let me compute ΔE/(k) equals (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So ΔE/(k) is 1 K.

So substituting back:

ln(2) = (1 K) * (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, but I need to relate this to T1 and T2. Let's rearrange:

ln(2) = (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Hmm, but that's not exactly matching any of the options. Let me look at the options.

Option A: ln(2) = [T2 / T1]

No, that can't be.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

Hmm, that's (T1+T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 + 1/T1). So ln(2) = 1/T2 + 1/T1. But in our equation, it's ln(2) = (1/T1 - 1/T2 ), so this doesn't match.

Option C: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

No, that seems more complicated. Maybe not.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1 ). Which is -(1/T1 -1/T2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

Wait, from our equation, we have:

ln(2) = (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Which can be written as ( (T2 - T1) )/( T1 T2 )

Which is negative of (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So our equation is ln(2) = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2 )

But none of the options directly have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, our equation after substitution is:

ln(2) = (ΔE / k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Since ΔE = k, so (ΔE /k) = 1.

So ln(2) = (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

(1/T1 - 1/T2 ) = ln(2 )

So, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = ln(2 )

Hmm. Let me think in terms of T1 and T2.

Let me factor this as:

( T2 - T1 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

So,

( T2 - T1 ) = T1 T2 ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

T1 - T2 = - T1 T2 ln(2 )

Not sure if that helps, but looking at the options:

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is equivalent to (T1 - T2) = ln(2) * T1 T2.

But from our equation, we have (T2 - T1) = ln(2) * T1 T2, which is the negative of option D's equation.

So, perhaps I should think about which one makes sense.

Wait, in the equation, 1/T1 - 1/T2 = ln(2), which is positive because if star_1 has more excitation, it must be hotter than star_2, so T1 > T2. So 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative because T1 > T2, so 1/T1 < 1/T2. So their difference would be negative.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. If T1 is higher than T2, then 1/T1 is less than 1/T2. So 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative, but ln(2) is positive. So this would imply that a positive equals a negative, which can't be right. That suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the ratio. Let me go back to the Boltzmann equation.

The ratio of the upper to lower states is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So for star_1, ratio is n1 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, it's n2 = (g) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The problem says that n1 = 2 n2.

So,

(g exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) / (g exp(-ΔE/(k T2))) ) = 2

So,

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) = 2

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) -1/(T1) )) = 2

Taking natural logs,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

Since ΔE = k, this becomes:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2 )

Which can be written as:

( 1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2 )

So,

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Because 1/T2 -1/T1 = ( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 )

So,

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Which is the same as option D: ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ]

Yes. So option D is correct.


The question involves determining the correct equation relating the effective temperatures, \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \), of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The problem states that the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high as in star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). The photospheres are assumed to be in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the upper and lower energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excitation are:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Given that the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2, we have:

\[
\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}.
\]

Dividing the two equations and simplifying:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1,\text{upper}}}{n_{1,\text{lower}}}}{\frac{n_{2,\text{upper}}}{n_{2,\text{lower}}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the ratio is 2, we have:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and the energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} = 1 \), simplifying the equation to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}.
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D. The other options are incorrect because:

- **Option A**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \) does not match the derived equation.
- **Option B**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 + T_2}{T_1 T_2} \) is inconsistent with the derived equation.
- **Option C**: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{(T_1 T_2)^2} \) introduces an incorrect dependence on \( (T_1 T_2)^2 \).

Thus, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
