Okay, so I have this question where I need to identify the product of a reaction involving compound X. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction, but wait, wait. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI usually do an acid-catalyzed addition, but wait, no, no, wait. Wait, another thought: red phosphorus is used in the formation of the phosphorus ylide for the Wittig reaction. Oh wait, but in this case, the reaction is with HI and P. So perhaps it's a hydroboration? No, wait, hydroboration uses a different catalyst. Wait, no, maybe it's a halogenation reaction. Or perhaps it's the addition of HI to an alkene.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out what compound X is. The question gives the IR and NMR data, so I can try to deduce the structure of X.

Let's look at the IR data first. The peaks are in the ranges: 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720, 1610, 1450 cm-1.

The 3400–2500 cm-1 region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since the other options are organic, maybe it's an O-H stretch like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, the other peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group (C=O) like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents.

Now looking at the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm: That's a very downfield shift. For protons, that's typically an aldehyde proton. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton, which is usually very broad. The 10.5 is a broad singlet (bs), so maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an aldehyde would be a triplet or something, but since it's a singlet, maybe it's a -COOH group.

Wait, let's think: The 1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs
