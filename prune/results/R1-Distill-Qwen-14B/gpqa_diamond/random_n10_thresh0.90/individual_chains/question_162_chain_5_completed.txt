Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, pseudosphere... I remember that's a term from general relativity or maybe differential geometry. Wait, a pseudosphere is like a surface with constant negative curvature, right? It's also called an anti-sphere or something like that.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh, right, in two dimensions because it's only dx and dy. So this is probably a 2D metric. 

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, pseudospheres are usually considered in 3D or 2D? I think in 2D, the pseudosphere is an infinite surface with hyperbolic geometry, but maybe this metric represents a finite area?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think about the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), so that suggests that x² + y² <4. Because if x² + y² >=4, the denominator becomes zero or negative, which might not be physical. So the coordinates are constrained to x² + y² <4, which is inside a circle of radius 2. So the "radius" of the sphere is 2 because 4 is 2 squared. That makes sense.

In standard spherical coordinates, the area element on a sphere is r² sinθ dθ dφ, but this isn't a sphere, it's a pseudosphere. Wait, no, pseudosphere would have a different curvature. Wait, the metric here is of the form ds² = f(r)² (dr² + r² dθ²), but in this case, it's written in terms of x and y. Oh wait, actually, x and y are like polar coordinates because dx² + dy² is r² dr² + r² dθ²... Wait, no, dx² + dy² is r² dr² + r² dθ²? No, wait, in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². But here, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y².

Wait, so the function f(r) here is sqrt(32/(4 - r²)). Hmm, but the area element in 2D would be (f(r) * r) dr dθ, right? Because in polar coordinates, the area element is r dr dθ, but scaled by the metric factor. So the area A would be the integral over r and θ.

Wait, let's clarify. The area in 2D is given by the integral of sqrt(det g) dr dθ. The metric in our case is diagonal: the coefficients are (f(r), 0, 0, f(r) r²). So the determinant is f(r)^2. So sqrt(det g) is f(r). Therefore, the area element is f(r) * r dr dθ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The metric is:

ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²).

So g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ = (32 r²)/(4 - r²). The determinant of the metric is g_rr * g_θθ = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2. So sqrt(det g) is (32 r)/(4 - r²). So the area is the integral of sqrt(det g) dr dθ.

The limits of integration for r would be from 0 to 2 because when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero. So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, that integral might be a bit tricky. Let's compute it step by step. Let’s compute the r integral first.

Let me compute the integral of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let’s make a substitution: let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → -du/2 = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes:

∫ (32 r dr) [1/(4 - r²)] = 32 ∫ (r dr) / u.

Substituting, 32 ∫ (-du/2) / u = (-32/2) ∫ (du/u) from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-16) [ ln|u| ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but when u approaches 0, ln(0) is negative infinity. So:

(-16) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] = (-16) [ (-infinite) - ln4 ] = (-16) (-infinite - something) ) → positive infinite.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me recheck the limits. The substitution u = 4 - r² starts at r=0, u=4, and goes to r=2, u=0. So the integral is from u=4 to u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ] = 32 * ( ∫ from 4 to 0 (-du/(2u)) ) )

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the substitution signs.

Wait, the integral I = ∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me make substitution u=4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So, I = ∫ [32 (r dr) ]/(4 - r²) = ∫ [32 * (-du/2) ] / u.

Which is 32*(-1/2) ∫ (du/u) from u=4 (when r=0) to u=0 (when r=2).

So that's -16 ∫ (du/u) from 4 to 0.

Which is -16 [ ln u ] evaluated from 4 to 0 → -16 [ ln 0 - ln 4 ].

But ln 0 is negative infinity. So this becomes -16 [ (-inf) - ln4 ] = -16 (-inf - finite ) → positive infinity.

Wait, but wait! The integral is from 4 to 0, so the substitution would change the limits. Let me reevaluate.

I = 32 ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

After substitution, u=4 - r².

So when r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes:

32 ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (-du/2) / u ] = 32 * (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du.

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ ln u from 4 to 0 ].

Which is (-16) [ ln 0 - ln 4 ].

ln 0 approaches negative infinity, so ln0 is -infty.

So (-16) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = (-16) ( -infty - finite ) → positive infinity because (-infty - finite) is -infty, multiplied by (-16) gives +infty.

So the integral I is divergent, it goes to infinity. Which means the area is infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So according to this calculation, the area is infinite. So looking at the options, option D is +infty.

Wait, but why is this the case? Because a pseudosphere in hyperbolic space is an infinite surface, right? So perhaps the area is indeed infinite.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again. The integral is ∫ (32 r dr)/(4 - r²) from 0 to 2.

Let me compute it without substitution: 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me set u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So 32 * ∫ [r dr / u ] = 32 * ∫ (-du/2 ) / u = -16 ∫ du/u.

Which is -16 ln |u| + C.

Evaluated from r=0 to r=2 → u=4 to u=0.

So:

-16 [ ln 0 - ln4 ] → -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = -16 (-infty - ...) = +infty.

So the integral diverges to positive infinity.

Therefore, the area is infinite. So the answer should be D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

where \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\) to avoid singularities or negative values in the denominator. This represents a 2D surface with hyperbolic geometry, often referred to as a pseudosphere. The task is to compute the area of this pseudosphere with radius \(r = 2\).

To calculate the area, we use the standard formula for the area of a surface in 2D, which involves the determinant of the metric tensor. The metric is diagonal, with components:

\[
g_{rr} = \frac{32}{4 - r^2}, \quad g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32 r^2}{4 - r^2},
\]

where \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\). The determinant of the metric is:

\[
\text{det}(g) = g_{rr} \cdot g_{\theta\theta} = \frac{32^2 r^2}{(4 - r^2)^2}.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dr \, d\theta = \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is obtained by integrating over the entire surface. The limits for \(r\) are \(0 \leq r < 2\), and for \(\theta\), \(0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\). Thus, the area is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -16 \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln|u|\right]_4^0.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln|u| \to -\infty\), so the integral diverges to \(+\infty\). This indicates that the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\) is \(+\infty\).
