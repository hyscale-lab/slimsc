--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We're supposed to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so first, I think I should break this problem into parts. Let's see. First, the initial solution after dilution, then the titration process.

So the first step is mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. When you mix equal volumes, the concentration should dilute by half, right? So the initial concentration after mixing would be 0.025 M. Wait, wait, let me calculate that properly.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be volume (in liters) times molarity. Volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles.

When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So yes, the initial concentration after dilution is 0.025 M.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, what's 25% titration? I think that means we've added a quarter of the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point. Alternatively, it could mean that a quarter of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized. Let me think about the equivalence point first.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid would have reacted with NaOH. So let's find out how much NaOH is needed for that.

The moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 mol (from earlier). The reaction between CH3COOH and NaOH is 1:1, because each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH to produce CH3COO^- Na+ and water.

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. So 25% titration would be at 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added, right? Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

Wait, but sometimes percentage titration is done by the amount of acid neutralized. Let me double-check that. So, 25% titration implies that 25% of the acetic acid has been reacted with NaOH. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 * 0.001 mol = 0.00025 mol. The volume of NaOH needed would be 0.00025 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³, which matches the earlier calculation. So yes.

Now, I'll need to find the pH at two points: when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added (25% titration) and when 10 cm³ has been added (equivalence point).

Let me start with the 25% titration point.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been converted to acetate ions. Let's model the solution.

First, the total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ NaOH to the 40 cm³ initial solution. Wait, no. Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ (20+20). Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution.

So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Moles of NaOH added: 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.25 mL * 0.1 mol/mL ? Wait, no. Let's compute it correctly. 2.5 cm³ is 0.0025 L. So moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of CH3COOH that have reacted is 0.00025 mol. So the remaining moles of CH3COOH are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

And moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

So the solution now has both acetic acid and its conjugate base. This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Let me calculate pKa: log(1.85e-5) is about 4.735 (since 1e-5 is 5, 2e-5 is 4.7, 1.85 is closer to 4.73). Wait, let me compute it accurately.

Ka = 1.85 x 10^-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute this.

log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733. So approximately 4.73.

So, pH = pKa + log (moles of A^- / moles of HA )

Because in the buffer, the concentrations are moles divided by total volume.

So [A^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 5.882e-3 M.

[HA] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. So about 4.25.

Looking at the options, the first value needs to be around 4.25. Let me glance at the options: option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So option A's first value is close.

Now, at the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

At equivalence point, we've added 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

So let's compute the moles of NaOH added: 10 cm³ is 0.01 L. Moles NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 mol.

Which is exactly the moles of acetic acid we had earlier (0.001 mol). So all acetic acid is converted to acetate.

The solution after adding NaOH: The total volume is 40 cm³ (original) +10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) is 0.001 mol.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found using Kw / Ka.

Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

We can model this using the approximation for weak bases. The expression for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is small compared to initial concentration, which is 0.02 M, so:

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98.

So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but the options given don't have a pH around 9. Let me look again. The options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52  
B) 3.17; 6.73  
C) 4.73; 7.00  
D) 4.57; 6.92

Hmm, none of these have a pH around 9. I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recheck the Kb and the hydrolysis.

Wait, another thought: wait, maybe I made a mistake in the concentration. Let me recalculate the acetate concentration.

At equivalence, the moles of acetate is 0.001 mol, and the total volume is 50 cm³ = 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That part is correct.

Wait, Kb is correct: 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1/1.85) * (1e-14 / 1e-5) )= (0.5405) * (1e-9) ) → 5.405e-10.

So the Kb is correct. So the calculation x² = Kb * C → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 → pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14-4.98=9.02.

But none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the concentration after equivalence isn't just 0.02 M. Let me think, maybe the solution is not just acetate. Wait, no, at equivalence, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate, so the solution is 0.02 M sodium acetate. So that part is correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation of the volume. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³. After adding 10 cm³ NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³. So the concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, but the calculated pH is around 9.02, but the options don't have that. Let me look again at the options. Option D's equivalence pH is 6.92, which is way off. Option A is 8.52, which is closer but still not 9.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute Kb more accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈4.733.

Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 → 1e-14 is 5.405e-10 as before.

So Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I should not make the assumption that x is small. Let me compute it without that approximation.

The hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration is 0.02 M acetate. Changes: -x, +x, +x.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x, [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.

The expression is Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) → 5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02 -x)

Assuming x is tiny, 0.02 -x ≈0.02. So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach for the equivalence point.

Wait another idea: perhaps the solution is being treated as a buffer? No, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base. So the approach should be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the dilution when calculating the pH at equivalence. Oh wait, no, I accounted for the total volume in the concentration. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial dilution. Let me double-check that.

Wait, initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M → moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct. After adding 20 cm³ of water, volume is 40 cm³ → 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Hmm. So perhaps there's an error in the calculation of the equivalence point pH. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using the formula for a salt of a weak acid.

The pH can be calculated with the formula:

pH = pKa + log (C) + 0.5 * pKb ?

Wait, no, that's not right. The pH of a salt solution (like sodium acetate) can be found using the Kb and the concentration. Another approach is to use the hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

So the Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-]/[CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, so [CH3COO^-] ≈0.02.

So Kb = x² /0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5, as before.

So [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH =4.98 → pH=9.02.

But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the Kb. Let me calculate 1e-14 /1.85e-5 again.

1e-14 ÷1.85e-5 → same as (1e-14) * (1/(1.85e-5)).

1/(1.85e-5) is approximately 5.405e4. So 1e-14 *5.405e4 =5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps I messed up the units when calculating moles or volume. Let me check.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH = 0.1 M * 0.01 L =0.001 mol. Which is correct.

Moles of CH3COO^- is 0.001 mol, correct.

Volume is 50 cm³ =0.05 L.

So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M → correct.

So calculation should be correct, but the pH is around 9, which isn't in the options.

Hmm. Perhaps the question is about the half-equivalence point? No, the question says 25% titration and equivalence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% calculation. Let me recheck that part.

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH added. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH reacted: 0.00025 → remaining is 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025.

Total volume: 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ =0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 /0.0425 =approx 0.017647 M.

[A^-] =0.00025 /0.0425 =approx 0.005882 M.

So pH = pKa + log (0.005882/0.017647) → pKa is 4.73.

The ratio is (0.00025/0.00075) = 1/3 → log(1/3)= -0.477.

So pH=4.73 -0.477=4.253 → approx 4.25.

Which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

So the pH at 25% is about 4.25, and at equivalence it's about 9.02. But none of the options have 9. So perhaps I made a mistake? Or perhaps the options have a mistake.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D has 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach for the equivalence point. Let me think differently.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact formula without the assumption that x is negligible. Let's try that.

So for the equivalence point:

The equation is Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assume x is not negligible, so 0.02 -x ≈0.02 -x.

But for small x, 0.02 is much larger than x. So the approximation should hold. So I'm confident that the pH is around 9.02, which isn't in any options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles of NaOH.

Wait, wait, perhaps the initial solution after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid, and when titrated, the equivalence point is when 25 mL of 0.1 M NaOH is added?

Wait, let's recalculate the equivalence point.

Molarity of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M in 40 cm³.

Moles of acetic acid =0.025 M * 0.04 L =0.001 mol.

Equivalence point requires 0.001 mol of NaOH.

Volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 M =0.01 L=10 cm³. So that's correct.

But then the solution after adding 10 cm³ (from 40 to 50 cm³) is 0.001 mol acetate in 0.05 L → 0.02 M. Correct.

So I'm not seeing any mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the question actually refers to the pH at 25% of the way to the equivalence point, but considering the dilution?

Wait, no, the 25% refers to the titration, so the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach for the equivalence point. Wait, maybe I should calculate the concentration of acetate differently. Or perhaps I made a mistake in considering the solution's ionic strength or activity coefficients, but that's way beyond the scope of this problem. So I think that's not it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the initial concentration before dilution. Let me see. No, the problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M with 20 cm³ of water, then titrate. So the initial concentration is definitely 0.025 M.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should consider that at the equivalence point, the solution is not just acetate but also some excess OH- from the NaOH? No, because at equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted, and the NaOH is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me compute Kb more accurately:

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, 1.85e-5 is 1.85 x 10^-5.

So log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → 0.267 + (-5) → -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps using a more precise calculation for x:

x^2 = Kb * C → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) → let's compute this exactly.

The square root of 1.081e-11 is approximately 3.287e-6. Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, 1e-11 is 1e-5 squared. So sqrt(1e-11)=1e-5.5= approx 3.16e-6.

Wait, wait, 1.081e-11 → sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04, so sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.5? Wait, no. Wait, 1e-11 is (1e-5.5)^2. Because 1e-5 squared is 1e-10, and 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 1e-11 is between them. Let me compute it accurately.

Let me compute sqrt(1.081e-11):

1.081e-11 → 1.081 * 1e-11 → sqrt(1.081) is about 1.04, so 1.04 * 1e-5.5 → 1e-5.5 is sqrt(1e-11) = 3.16e-6, so 1.04 *3.16e-6 ≈3.286e-6? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1e-5.5 is 3.16e-6.

Wait, because 1e-5 is 1e-5, square is 1e-10. 1e-6 squared is 1e-12. So 1e-11 is between, so sqrt is sqrt(1e-11)= 3.16e-6.

So sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081)* sqrt(1e-11) → approximately 1.04 * 3.16e-6 → 3.286e-6.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 1.04e-5, which would be 1.04e-5, but that's 1e-5, not 1e-6. So I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me compute x again.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 5.405e-10 *2e-2 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 3.286e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.286e-6 → pOH = -log(3.286e-6).

Log(3.286e-6) is log(3.286) + log(1e-6) → 0.516 + (-6) → -5.484.

So pOH =5.484 → pH =14 -5.484=8.516 → approximately 8.52.

Oh! So the pH at equivalence point is approximately 8.52. That matches option A's second value.

Wait, what did I do wrong earlier? Oh, I think I miscalculated the square root. I incorrectly thought that sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5, but it's actually 3.16e-6, so when I calculated x as 1.04e-5, that was wrong. The correct x is 3.286e-6, which gives a pH of about 8.52.

Ah, that makes sense now. So the equivalence pH is 8.52, and the 25% titration pH is 4.25, which is option A: 4.26;8.52.

Wait, let me double-check the x calculation.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) → let's compute this more accurately.

Compute 1.081e-11 → 1.081 * 1e-11. Let me compute the square root.

The square root of 1.081 is about 1.04 (since 1.04 squared is 1.0816). So sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) → 1.04 * 1e-5.5 → since 1e-5.5 is roughly 3.16e-6, so 1.04 *3.16e-6 ≈3.286e-6.

So [OH^-] =3.286e-6 → pOH =5.484 → pH=8.516, which is approximately 8.52.

So the equivalence pH is 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of CH}_3\text{COOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### 25% Titration Point
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Remaining moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ions (\(\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-\)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is now:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.0176 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.0176} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ions. The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{OH}^-\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
\]

Assuming \(x\) is small compared to 0.02 M:

\[
K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}, \quad x \approx \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.286 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Thus, \([\text{OH}^-] = 3.286 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\). The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.286 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
