Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to figure out what's going on. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the given options.

First, let's look at the spectral data provided. The IR and NMR data should help me figure out what the starting material, Compound X, is. Once I know that, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data: 

The IR shows strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That broad region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So putting this together, maybe there's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached, like a benzene ring with a ketone substituent.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Alternatively, sometimes a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12 ppm. But this is a broad singlet, which is more typical for an -OH group, maybe like a phenolic OH. Hmm, but also, a carboxylic acid would be a broad peak, but around 10.5, maybe. Alternatively, an aldehyde? But the integration is 1H, which fits an aldehyde or a phenolic OH.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. If it were a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, but maybe a bit higher. So that might fit. But then the OH in the NMR would be a broad peak, which can be the -OH of the acid. Alternatively, if it's a ketone, the 10.5 would be something else. But wait, the 10.5 is a singlet with broadness. Maybe it's an aldehyde, which is a bit less common as a broad peak, but possible. Alternatively, perhaps an acidic proton elsewhere.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) look like a pair of doublets, probably from an aromatic ring with substituents. The two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene, because each set of 2H is each pair of protons. For example, if you have a substituent on the benzene ring at the para position, you get two sets of doublets. So the substituents are probably in the para positions, perhaps with another substituent elsewhere.

Wait, but the integrating of those peaks: 8.0 (2H) and 7.2 (2H) would sum to 4H on the aromatic ring, which fits para substitution. So the benzene has two substituents, each in para positions, perhaps a group and another group.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH near an electronegative atom or in a CH2 group. 

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 adjacent to something else, maybe a branching point. 

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, probably a methyl group attached to something else, like a CH that's split into a doublet because of coupling. Maybe a CH(CH3) group, like in an isobutyl or similar.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H, probably a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, the structure might have a benzene ring with substituents. The substituents could include a carbonyl group (from the IR at 1720) and an ethyl chain or some branched chain.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. So if it's a ketone, that would be around 1700-1750. But another possibility is an ester or a carboxylic acid, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H in the NMR would have to match. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes have lower carbonyl peaks, maybe around 1720. Hmm.

Wait, if it's an aldehyde, the proton would be around 9-10 ppm. The NMR shows 10.5, which is a bit higher, but possible. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl that's more electron-withdrawing, maybe an acid anhydride, but that's less likely.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Then the IR at 1720 would fit a ketone. But then the 10.5 peak wouldn't fit a ketone because ketones don't have protons. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe the 10.5 ppm peak isn't a carbonyl proton. If the molecule has an -OH group, like a phenol, that could explain the broad peak. So if the benzene ring has an -OH group, then that peak would be from the phenol. But the IR doesn't show a broad peak around 3300 for a strong O-H stretch. Wait, the IR given is from 3400–2500, which is a broad region. But the exact peaks listed are 3400–2500 (maybe O-H stretch?), 1720, 1610, 1450.

Wait, the peak at 1720 is likely the carbonyl. So maybe the structure has a benzene ring with a ketone substituent and an -OH group. Oh wait, but the NMR only has a singlet at 10.5, which would be the -OH. Alternatively, maybe the -OH is part of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the reaction. Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction called the hydroiodide addition. Wait, no, wait: when you have a carbonyl, like a ketone, and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it typically leads to a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe a Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig reaction uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction of a carbonyl with HI and red phosphorus is the Clemmensen reduction. But wait, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, not HI and red phosphorus. Wait, maybe it's another type of reaction. Oh, wait, I think that when you have a ketone or aldehyde reacting with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to reduce the carbonyl group. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyls. So, for example, a ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol, or an aldehyde to a primary alcohol.

Wait, wait. So, if the starting material has a carbonyl group (like a ketone), then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would reduce it. So the product would have an alcohol group in place of the ketone.

But let's think about the structure of Compound X. From the NMR and IR data, I think X has a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and possibly a substituent with a chain that includes an ethyl group (from the triplet at 0.9 ppm).

Wait, let me try to sketch out a possible structure for X.

The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents in the para positions. The substituents could include a carbonyl group and another group, maybe an isobutyl or ethyl group.

Looking at the NMR signals again:

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group; perhaps a CH(CH3) group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH that's next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe there's a ketone group, so the CH would be next to the carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a chain like CH2-C(O)-something. Or perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with a side chain.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propanoate group or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. Let me think: if the substituent is a propanone (acetone) group attached to the benzene, but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, let's think about the 10.5 ppm peak. If that's an aldehyde proton, then the structure could be benzaldehyde with a substituent. But the substituent would need to account for the other NMR signals.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like 4-(propan-2-yl)benzaldehyde. Let me think.

Benzaldehyde has the structure PhCHO. The aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, which fits the 10.5 ppm peak (though a bit high, but possible). Then, there's a substituent on the benzene ring. The other substituent would be in the para position, perhaps a branched chain.

Looking at the other signals: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a terminal CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH(CH3) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH2 group next to a branching point, maybe. So perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group? Or maybe a -CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a isopropyl group or a butyl group. Let me see. If the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH2CH3)), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be a CH2 group adjacent to a branching point. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group connected to the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe an acetyl group, like O=C-CH2-..., but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction next. If X has a carbonyl group, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, which is a reducing agent, the carbonyl (like ketone) would be reduced to a CH2 group, forming an alcohol.

Wait, no, more accurately, the reduction of a ketone with red phosphorus and HI would produce a secondary alcohol. So if X is a ketone, the product would have an -OH group where the carbonyl was.

But looking at the options given:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, looking at the options, options B and D are aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents, no functional groups. Options A and C are benzoic acid derivatives.

But the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If X has a carbonyl group, such as a ketone or aldehyde, the reaction would add HI and reduce the carbonyl.

Wait, but another possibility: if X is an ester, then HI might cause some kind of substitution, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the reaction could be a nucleophilic substitution if X is an alkyl halide, but that doesn't fit the IR and NMR data.

Wait, perhaps X is an aldehyde. So the aldehyde group would be reduced to a CH2OH group. Alternatively, if X is a ketone, it would become a secondary alcohol.

But looking at the options, none of them are alcohols except perhaps if I'm missing something. Wait, option C is a benzoic acid, which would imply that the carbonyl was oxidized, but that doesn't fit with the reaction conditions (since red phosphorus and HI are reducing).

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is an aldehyde, which upon reduction becomes a primary alcohol. But none of the options are alcohols. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone, and upon reaction, it becomes a secondary alcohol. Again, none of the options show an alcohol group.

Wait a minute, maybe I'm getting the reaction wrong. Red phosphorus and HI can also be involved in other reactions. For example, the reduction of esters, or maybe the addition to carbonyl groups. Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition, but that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, but that's not indicated by the IR.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl. Another possibility: the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that's an ethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group and the aldehyde is in a certain position.

Wait, let's try to build the structure of X. The benzene ring has substituents at the para positions. Let's say one substituent is an aldehyde (CHO) group, and the other is an ethyl group. But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which would be from a CH2CH3 group. So if the substituent is ethyl, then perhaps it's a para-ethylbenzaldehyde. But then, what about the other NMR signals?

Wait, the 1H NMR shows peaks at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). That would fit a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each having two protons. Wait, no, because if each substituent is a single group, then each would have certain protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are two different groups, each of which is a mono-substituent, leading to two sets of doublets.

Wait, but in para substitution, each group would cause the ring protons to split into two doublets. So perhaps the substituents are an aldehyde and another group, like a CH2CH2CH3 or something similar.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a chain that includes a ketone. Let me think again: the IR has 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. If the substituent is a -CO-R group, where R is an alkyl chain, then upon reduction with HI and red phosphorus, the ketone would become an alcohol.

But looking at the options, options A and C have carboxylic acids. How would we get a carboxylic acid from a ketone? That would require oxidation, but the reaction here is a reduction, so that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the starting material isn't a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but a substitution. Wait, if X is an ester, it could undergo hydrolysis with HI, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an acid chloride, but the NMR doesn't really point towards that.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that's a branched chain. Let's say the substituent is a -CH2-C(O)-CH2- group. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible structures of the options and see how the reaction would affect them.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH2CH2COOH attached to a para-ethyl benzene. But wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the benzene ring connected to the second carbon of the propanoic acid. The reaction that would form this from X would require an oxidation, but our reaction is a reduction. So probably not.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent in the para position. Again, this would involve oxidation, which isn't what our reaction is doing. So likely not.

Options B and D are simple alkyl benzene derivatives. If the starting material X has a carbonyl group, and the reaction reduces it, leading to an alcohol, but the options don't include an alcohol. So perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that's a tosyl group or another leaving group, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But I don't see such peaks in the IR.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reaction is a conjugate addition. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydride transfer. Red phosphorus and HI can act as a source of hydride ions. So a ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but the options don't show any alcohols. So perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl is replaced by an -O- group or something else.

Wait, wait. Another angle: the IR shows a peak at 1720, which could also be an ester. So if X is an ester, then reacting it with HI and red phosphorus could lead to some kind of substitution. For example, esters can undergo nucleophilic substitution, but with HI, perhaps it would substitute the ester's oxygen. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak around 2200 cm⁻¹, so that's probably not it.

Hmm. Maybe I should try to construct the structure of X based on the NMR data first.

The aromatic region suggests a para-disubstituted benzene. Let's say the substituents are two groups: one is an aldehyde (CHO) and another is a branched alkyl group. The substituents are at para positions.

The aldehyde would give the 10.5 ppm peak. The branched alkyl group would account for the other NMR signals.

The substituent's structure: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 connected to the CH that has the methyl group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH that is connected to both the methyl and the CH2 groups, and possibly the benzene ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group. Wait, but let me think about the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH in a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. Then the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 next to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) would be the terminal methyl of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene ring would be a -CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group? Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Let me see.

A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the structure would be: benzene ring with substituents at para positions: one is an aldehyde (CHO), the other is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show what?

The substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3). The CH2 would have protons that are split into a triplet because of coupling with the adjacent CH. The CH would have two neighboring groups. But perhaps the NMR would show a multiplet at around 1.7 ppm and 2.9 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with branching, leading to a 2.9 ppm peak for the central CH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group. That would give a singlet for the CH3 groups, but the NMR shows a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H). So that wouldn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, the substituent could be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would give a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Let me think about the structure: benzene ring with a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group in the para position and an aldehyde group.

Wait, but then the NMR would show a triplet around 1.7 ppm for the CH2, and a doublet at 2.9 ppm for the CH, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the entire structure. Let's say the structure of X is 4-(propan-2-yl)benzaldehyde. The propan-2-yl group is CH(CH3)2. So the substituent is a isopropyl group.

But then, the NMR would show the isopropyl group as a septet or something. Wait, in isopropyl group, you have CH(CH3)2. The central CH would couple with two methyl groups, giving a septet around 1.2 ppm? But in our NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH would have two adjacent CH2 groups, leading to more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So the structure would be:

Ph-C(O)H
|
Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)2

Wait, no, the substituent is at para position.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group. Let's say the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH3. Then, the NMR would show a triplet for the terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, t), a quartet for the adjacent CH2 (1.7 ppm?), but I'm not seeing that in the data.

Wait, in the NMR data, after the aromatic signals, the next is 2.9 ppm (m,1H), then 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H).

Let me think about a chain: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. No, that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So the central CH is connected to a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d) and a CH2CH2CH3 group. Then, the CH would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2 groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)2 group. Then, the CH2 would be next to a carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the degrees of unsaturation for Compound X.

IR shows aromatic rings (from the 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ peaks, which are typical for aromatic C=C). So benzene ring is present.

The carbonyl (1720) adds another degree of unsaturation.

The aldehyde proton (if present) adds another.

So the formula would have at least benzene plus a carbonyl and an aldehyde group, which seems a bit much. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzaldehyde substituted with a substituent that has a carbonyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone. For example, the structure is 4-(propan-2-one)benzaldehyde. But that would have two carbonyl groups, which might not fit the IR data, which only shows one strong peak around 1720. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a chain with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CO-CH2- group. So the structure would be benzaldehyde with a -COCH2- substituent in the para position. But that would have two carbonyl groups, which may not fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a carbonyl-containing group, like an acetyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH2CH2CH3 group. Then, the NMR would show the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COCH(CH3)2 group. That would give a singlet for the CH(CH3)2 group, but the NMR shows a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CO-R group, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at the reaction again.

X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. If X is a carbonyl compound, this reaction is likely a reduction. So the carbonyl (like a ketone) would become an alcohol.

If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, then after reduction, the aldehyde would become a primary alcohol.

But none of the options show an alcohol. So perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the reaction is a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by an -O- group, but I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition, but I don't see how.

Wait, another possibility: if the starting material is a nitrile, the reaction with HI could lead to an amine, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is a hydrolysis, but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acid chloride, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the options and see which one makes sense based on the reaction.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So that's a toluene derivative with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

If the starting material X was a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps with a ketone group, the reaction would have reduced the ketone to an alcohol. But again, none of the options show that.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but an elimination. Wait, but HI is a nucleophile and a good leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that has an ethyl group. The reaction with HI and red phosphorus would reduce the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. But none of the options show that.

Wait, if X is benzaldehyde with a substituent, like para-ethylbenzaldehyde, then the aldehyde would be reduced to a CH2OH group. But none of the options have an alcohol.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would imply that the starting material was a benzaldehyde with a substituent that, upon some oxidation, becomes a carboxylic acid. But our reaction is a reduction, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product. What does this reaction typically do?

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups to alcohols. For example, ketones → secondary alcohols, aldehydes → primary alcohols. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group, and the product would have an alcohol in place of it.

But looking at the options, none of the products have an alcohol group. So perhaps the starting material doesn't have a carbonyl group? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting material is an ester, and the reaction is a hydrolysis. For example, an ester could hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid under acidic or basic conditions. But red phosphorus and HI are more likely to cause a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a nitrile, which upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus would be reduced to an amine. But again, the options don't show amines.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to figure out the structure of X based on the NMR data.

The aromatic signals at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted benzene. So the substituents are in para positions. Let's say substituent A is in position 1 and substituent B is in position 3 (para to each other).

The 10.5 ppm peak is likely an aldehyde proton. So substituent A is an aldehyde group (-CHO). Substituent B is another group.

Now, substituent B's structure is determined by the other NMR signals. The substituent B must have a structure that gives the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) signals.

Looking at the substituent B, the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, probably part of an ethyl chain. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group, and the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH group connected to both a CH2 and a CH3.

Putting this together, substituent B could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3 group, but that seems too long. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group connected to the ring.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene ring.

But then, the NMR would show the CH2 as a quartet or something. Alternatively, if it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH would be next to a CH2CH2CH3 group. The CH would have two sets of neighboring protons, leading to a multiplet around 2.9 ppm. The CH2 groups would be split into multiplets as well.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group, but that would give septet for the CH, which isn't seen here.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR signals suggest a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3. But that would have more protons than the data shows.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -CH2-CH(CH3) group, but that would require more protons.

Wait, perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Let's see:

Ph-CHO (substituent A)
Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3) (substituent B, para to A)

But the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H, t), which fits the terminal CH3 of CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH attached to both the ring and the CH2CH2CH3 group.

So the substituent B would be a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring.

So the structure of X would be 4-(1-propyl)-benzaldehyde. Or, more accurately, 4-(propan-2-yl)benzaldehyde? Not exactly sure.

But then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be reduced to a CH2OH group. So the product would be 4-(propan-2-yl)benzyl alcohol.

But looking at the options, none of them are alcohols. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the substituent.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps substituent B is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So the structure would be Ph-CHO and Ph-CH2CH(CH3)2. The NMR would show the CH2 as a quartet, but the data shows a multiplet at 1.7 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Then, the CH would be at 2.9 ppm, the CH2 next to it would be at 1.7 ppm, and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm.

Wait, that makes more sense. So substituent B is a -CH(CH2CH3) group. So the structure is 4-(1-propyl)benzaldehyde.

Then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde would be reduced to a primary alcohol, giving Ph-CH2OH and the substituent remains as -CH(CH2CH3).

But looking at the options, none of them are alcohols. So perhaps I'm on the wrong track.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the options and see which one would fit the reaction.

Option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That structure would be a benzene ring with a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions. But how would that form from a reaction involving red phosphorus and HI?

If the starting material X had a carbonyl group that was reduced to a CH2 group, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: if X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that's a ketone, then the reaction would reduce both carbonyl groups. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetophenone derivative (a ketone attached to benzene), and the reaction reduces the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But again, the options don't show alcohols.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a benzaldehyde but a benzene ring with an ester group. For example, phenyl acetate. Then, the ester could undergo hydrolysis with HI, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl chloride, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by HI. For example, if X has a good leaving group like a tosylate, the reaction with HI would substitute it with an iodide. But again, the options don't show iodides.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to go back and see if I can better determine the structure of X.

Looking at the NMR data again:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each d, 2H): para-substituted benzene.

Other signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a methylene or methine group adjacent to another group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 next to a branching point.

1.4 ppm (d,3H): a methyl group attached to something, like CH(CH3).

0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal methyl group, likely part of an ethyl chain.

So, the substituent must have a chain that includes an ethyl group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet), a methyl group attached to a CH (1.4 ppm), and a CH that is connected to a benzene ring and a CH2 group (2.9 ppm).

Putting this together, the substituent is likely a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. So the structure would be a para-substituted benzene with substituents: aldehyde (CHO) and -CH(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a singlet for the methyl groups. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group, but that would require the CH to be adjacent to a CH2CH3.

Wait, no, the substituent would be -CH(CH2CH2CH3), which would give the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) as the CH, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) as the CH2 adjacent to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) as the terminal methyl.

So, putting it all together, X is para-(aldehyde and -CH(CH2CH2CH3)) benzene.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, the aldehyde group (CHO) is reduced to a CH2OH group. So the product would be para-(CH2OH and -CH(CH2CH2CH3)) benzene.

But none of the options show an alcohol. So perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce the aldehyde but does something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the substituent.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that is a -CH2-CO-R group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the substituent is a chain leading to the NMR signals.

Another approach: let's consider the molecular formula based on the NMR.

Assuming the molecule is C9H12O (just a guess), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's C10H14O.

Alternatively, the substituent might be a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which would add more carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the most plausible option based on the reaction.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid
B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene
C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid
D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Assuming the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol, but none of the options show an alcohol, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce the carbonyl but does something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that includes a carbonyl, like a benzyl ketone. So, for example, (4-ethylphenyl)propanal. Then, the reaction would reduce the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. But again, none of the options show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the aldehyde is replaced by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl. For example, if X is an aldehyde, HI could add to the carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the information.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That structure has a benzene ring with a methyl group and a sec-butyl group in the para positions.

If X had a carbonyl group in the para position, say a ketone, then upon reduction, the ketone would become a CH2 group, leading to a structure like 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is the same as 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. So perhaps the starting material X was 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, which upon reduction becomes 4-(sec-butyl)toluene.

Wait, wait. Acetophenone is a ketone attached to benzene. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a CH2OH group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)tolueneol. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde. Then, upon reduction, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol. Again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, but that's option C. But then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group to an alcohol, giving 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl alcohol, which isn't an option.

Wait, but looking at the NMR of X, which includes a peak at 10.5 ppm, which would fit a carboxylic acid (-COOH) proton. If X is a benzoic acid derivative, then the reaction could be something else.

Wait, let me think again. If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the acid group. But how? Carboxylic acids are not typically reduced by red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, maybe the reaction converts the acid to a methyl ester or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that is a sec-butyl group. Then, upon reduction, it becomes a primary alcohol.

But again, the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't reduce the carbonyl but instead substitutes it. For example, perhaps the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodide. So, X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent, and the aldehyde becomes an iodide. But I'm not sure what structure that would give.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Crossed Cannizzaro reaction, but that requires a strong base, which HI isn't.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should look for the most plausible option based on the data.

The IR and NMR data suggest a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (probably aldehyde or ketone), and a substituent that has a chain with a CH(CH3), a CH2, and a terminal CH3.

Looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The substituents would be a methyl and a sec-butyl group in para positions.

So perhaps the starting material X was 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, and the reaction reduces the aldehyde to a methyl group, leading to option D.

Wait, no. The reduction of benzaldehyde would produce benzyl alcohol, not a methyl group.

Wait, another possibility: if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone (a ketone), then the reduction would produce 4-(sec-butyl)toluene (option D).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if X is acetophenone with a sec-butyl substituent in the para position, then reduction would convert the ketone (CO) to a CH2 group, giving toluene with a sec-butyl group.

But wait, acetophenone is a ketone attached directly to the benzene. So 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone would have the structure:

Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone would be:

Ph-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2, but that's a different substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be:

Ph-(CO)-R, where R is a sec-butyl group.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, which upon reduction becomes 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

But looking at the NMR data, does that fit?

Wait, the NMR for X would have peaks for the aldehyde (if it were an aldehyde) but in this hypothesis, X is a ketone. So the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't be an aldehyde but maybe a phenol or something else.

Wait, perhaps the 10.5 peak is a phenolic -OH. But then the IR would show a broad O-H stretch around 3300 cm⁻¹, which the question's IR data includes as a broad region from 3400–2500 cm-¹. The 1720 cm⁻¹ would then be a carbonyl from a ketone or ester.

So if X is a ketone with a phenol group, perhaps. But in that case, the NMR would show a broad peak for the phenol. But in the given NMR, the 10.5 is a singlet, which can be either an aldehyde or a phenol.

If X is a para-substituted benzene with a phenol group and a ketone group, then the NMR would show the phenol as a broad peak, and the ketone would show up as a singlet in the carbonyl region.

But then, the reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH2 group, and the phenol would remain.

But none of the options show a phenol. So perhaps this isn't the case.

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should make a decision based on the given options and the most plausible reaction.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which likely reduces a carbonyl group to an alcohol. But none of the options are alcohols, so perhaps the reaction doesn't involve a reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material doesn't have a carbonyl group, and the reaction is something else.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which could be an ester. So perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is a hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

If X is an ester, like para-ethyl benzoate, then the reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not be hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a transesterification, but again, I'm not sure.

If X is an ester, then the product after hydrolysis would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoyl chloride, then hydrolysis would give option C. But the reaction conditions don't seem to fit hydrolysis.

Alternatively, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)ethyl benzoate, and the reaction is hydrolysis, it would give benzoic acid, but that's not option C.

Alternatively, perhaps X is 4-(sec-butyl) propanoate, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm stuck, so I'll have to make an educated guess.

Based on the reaction conditions and the options, the most plausible answer is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This would imply that the starting material X was a ketone (like 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone), which upon reduction becomes a toluene derivative.

So the answer is D.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The spectral data provided (IR and NMR) helps determine the structure of Compound X, and the reaction conditions suggest a reduction of a carbonyl group to an alcohol. However, none of the options explicitly show an alcohol, so the reaction pathway must be carefully analyzed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - A strong absorption at **1720 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely a ketone or aldehyde.
   - Peaks at **1610 cm⁻¹** and **1450 cm⁻¹** suggest the presence of an aromatic ring.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Likely corresponds to an aldehyde proton (-CHO) or a phenolic -OH group.
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Indicate a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Suggest a chain with a terminal methyl group (CH₃), a CH group, and a CH₂ group, consistent with a sec-butyl group.

3. **Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI**:
   - Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents that typically reduce carbonyl groups (aldehydes or ketones) to alcohols. However, none of the options explicitly show an alcohol, suggesting the reaction may involve a different pathway or the starting material has a specific structure.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid)**: This is a carboxylic acid, which would require oxidation of a carbonyl group. The reaction conditions (reduction) make this unlikely.
   - **Option B (1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure does not align with the spectral data, as it lacks a carbonyl group.
   - **Option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid)**: This is a carboxylic acid, which would require oxidation. The reaction conditions do not support this.
   - **Option D (1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene)**: This structure aligns with the spectral data if the starting material is a ketone (e.g., 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone). The reaction would reduce the ketone to a CH₂ group, forming 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that Compound X is a ketone (e.g., 4-(sec-butyl)acetophenone), and the reaction reduces the ketone to a CH₂ group, resulting in 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. This matches the spectral data and the reaction conditions.
