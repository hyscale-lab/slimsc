Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

So the question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The speed of light is c. The options are A to D.

Wait, okay, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs at the equilibrium point, where all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different because of special relativity. Oh right, at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

In the classical case, the maximum speed v_max is given by sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy (1/2 k A²) equals the kinetic energy (1/2 m v_max²). So solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. Since the question is relativistic, option C might not be the correct answer here.

So in the relativistic scenario, the energy isn't just kinetic energy. The total energy includes relativistic effects. The total energy E is gamma m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But wait, the oscillator's potential energy is still (1/2)k x², right? But wait, I'm not so sure. Maybe at maximum amplitude, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², just like in the classical case. And at the equilibrium point, all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, so the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, no, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but I'm not considering quantum mechanics here. So treating it classically, the total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. But under relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma - 1) mc² or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by considering conservation of energy. At maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy E is (gamma_max - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

Wait, but wait. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2) k A² equals (1/2) m v_max². But relativistically, E is (gamma m c²) when considering kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Or is E the total energy, which includes rest mass?

Wait, let me think again. The total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. In the non-relativistic case, E = (1/2)k A² = (1/2) m v_max². But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy E would be equal to (gamma_max - 1) m c² + (1/2) k A²? Wait, no, because when at x=A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and potential is (1/2)k A². So E = (1/2)k A². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all that energy is kinetic.

So, setting E = kinetic energy at x=0. So (1/2)k A² = (gamma_max - 1) m c².

Wait, no. Because the potential energy is (1/2) k x², so when x = A, PE is (1/2) k A². At that point, the KE is zero. So the total mechanical energy is E = (1/2) k A².

At x=0, PE is zero, so KE is E. So KE = (gamma - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So, (gamma_max - 1) m c² = (1/2)k A².

So gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So we can write 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some variable to make it easier. Let me call it B = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then gamma_max = 1 + B.

But B could be any value, depending on the parameters. So gamma_max = 1 + B.

Wait, but if B is large, that would make gamma very large, which would mean v_max approaches c. But for small B, gamma is close to 1, and v_max is small.

But solving for v_max from gamma_max:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B.

So 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B.

Square both sides: 1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + B)^2.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2.

Then v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + B)^2.

So v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + B)^2 ].

Simplify the expression inside the brackets:

1 - 1/(1+B)^2 = [ (1+B)^2 - 1 ] / (1+B)^2.

Expanding (1+B)^2: 1 + 2B + B².

So numerator is (1 + 2B + B² - 1) = 2B + B².

So v² = c² * [ (2B + B²) ) / ( (1 + B)^2 ) ].

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

numerator: B(2 + B)

denominator: (1 + B)^2.

But since B is (k A²)/(2 m c²), let me substitute that back.

So numerator: B(2 + B) = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ 2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

Denominator: (1 + B)^2 = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]².

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I can express v_max in terms of B.

Wait, maybe I can re-express the equation for v_max in terms of B.

Wait, I have v² = c² [1 - 1/(1+B)^2 ].

Which can be written as v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1+B)^2 ).

Hmm.

Wait, let's compute 1 - 1/(1+B)^2.

That's [ (1+B)^2 -1 ] / (1+B)^2.

Which is (1 + 2B + B² - 1) / (1 + B)^2.

Which is (2B + B²)/(1 + B)^2.

Factor numerator: B(2 + B) .

Denominator: (1+B)^2.

So v_max = c * sqrt( B (2 + B) ) / (1 + B) )

Wait, but let's try to express it differently.

Hmm, let's see. Let me compute the expression inside the square root.

We have 1 - 1/(1+B)^2 = [ (1+B)^2 - 1 ] / (1+B)^2.

Which becomes [ (1 + 2B + B²) -1 ] / (1+B)^2.

So that's (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2.

Which can be written as B(2 + B) / (1 + B)^2.

Hmm.

But B is (k A²)/(2 m c²) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So plugging that in, we have:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c^2)) )^2 )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the conservation of energy more carefully.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the oscillator is E = (1/2)k A², as the potential energy at maximum displacement.

In the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c², and the potential is (1/2)k x².

So at x = 0, the kinetic energy is E, so:

(gamma_max - 1) m c² = (1/2) k A².

So, gamma_max = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) = 1 + (something).

But gamma_max is 1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me take the reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) = 1 / [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ].

Square both sides:

1 - (v_max^2/c^2) = 1 / [1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))]^2.

Then,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ].

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ].

Hmm, that's the expression. Let me compute the terms inside.

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as a term, say, alpha.

So alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Then,

v_max^2 = c^2 [1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Which is,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Simplify numerator: (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2 alpha + alpha²) ) / (1 + alpha).

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Let's substitute that back.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) * (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)) )

Hmm, perhaps we can simplify this.

Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ (4 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

Wait, 2 is 4 m c²/(2 m c²), so 2 = (4 m c²) / (2 m c²) ). Wait, perhaps that's complicating it more.

Alternatively, perhaps factor out (k A^2/(2 m c^2)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write everything in terms of option B.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, not exactly. Option B is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)} )

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, 1 + 1/(1 - x) = ( (1 - x) + 1 ) / (1 - x) ) = (2 - x)/(1 - x).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, wait. Let me look at the expression I have for v_max:

v_max^2 = c^2 [1 - (1/(1 + alpha)^2) ]

= c^2 [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ]

= c^2 [ (1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1) ] / (1 + alpha)^2

= c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm. Let's see, substituting alpha = (k A^2) / (2 m c^2) into this.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2.

Hmm, perhaps simplify this expression.

Let me compute numerator:

Numerator: (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)).

= (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2) / (2 m c^2) ) ]

Wait, 2 is 4 m c^2 / (2 m c^2), so 2 = [4 m c^2 / (2 m c^2)].

So 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = [4 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2) ).

So numerator becomes:

(k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] / [ (2 m c^2)(2 m c^2) ) ]

= [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] / [4 m² c^4 ]

Denominator: [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ]^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2) ) ]^2

= (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (2 m c^2 )^2.

So putting it all together:

v_max^2 = c² * [ [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

Hmm, because denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ] divided by (2 m c^2)^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] * [ 4 m² c^4 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ) ]

The 4 m² c^4 terms cancel out.

So,

v_max^2 = c² * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, let's see if we can factor this.

Let me write:

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 * (2*(2 m c^2) ) + k A^2 ) = Not sure, perhaps factor 2 m c^2.

Wait, 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps factor 2 m c^2 from denominator.

Wait, 2 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2)(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) = k A^2 ( 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 )

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

So, v_max^2 = c² * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / ( (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm.

Wait, let me factor 2 m c^2 from numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4 m c^2 = 2*(2 m c^2), so 4 m c^2 + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2.

Denominator: 2 m c^2 + k A^2.

Hmm, perhaps we can write it as:

v_max^2 = c² * [k A^2 (2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

= c² * [k A^2 * (2*(2 m c^2) + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, maybe it's possible to factor out 2 m c^2 from the terms.

Let me try:

Let me factor (2 m c^2) from the numerator inside the parenthesis:

= c² * [k A^2 * (2 m c^2)(2) + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

= c² * [k A^2 ( 2 m c^2 * 2 + k A^2 ) ] / denominator^2

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think about the given options.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Wait, let me compute what's inside that square root.

1 + 1/(1 - x) = [ (1 - x) + 1 ] / (1 - x ) = (2 - x )/(1 - x )

So option B becomes c * sqrt( (2 - x)/(1 - x) ), where x = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But my expression for v_max^2 is:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 ]

Hmm, that's a bit different.

Wait, let me try to simplify the numerator and denominator.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) = k A^2 (4 m c^2) + (k A^2)^2.

Denominator: (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = [2 m c^2]^2 + 2*(2 m c^2)(k A^2) + (k A^2)^2.

= 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c^2 k A^2 + k² A^4.

Hmm, not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compare the options to my expression.

Wait, my expression is:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(2 m c²)) (2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) )^2 )

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (alpha) (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha )^2 )

Where alpha = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm.

Wait, let me factor alpha from the numerator inside the square root:

= c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

= c * sqrt( [ (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) * alpha ] )

Wait, perhaps factor as:

= c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

= c * sqrt( alpha ) * sqrt(2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha )

Is there a way to relate this to any of the options?

Alternatively, perhaps I should express this in terms of option D or B.

Looking at option B:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) )

Which is c sqrt( [ (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) + 1 ] / (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

= c sqrt( [ 2 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ] / [1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] )

= c sqrt( [ 2 - x ] / [1 - x ] ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not sure if that's matching.

Alternatively, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which would be c * sqrt( ( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Hmm, the numerator is 1 + 2x +x² -1 = 2x + x², where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, v_max = c * sqrt( (2x + x² ) ) / (1 + x )

Which is the same as my expression for v_max, which is:

v_max = c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

Wait, but x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), so 2 + x = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, so [x (2 + x ) ] is x multiplied by ( 2 + x ), which is (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is the same as [ (k A^2) ( 2 m c^2 + k A^2 / 2 ) ] / ( 2 m c^2 )^2 ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again.

Wait, option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Which, when expanded, becomes the same as my expression for v_max^2.

Wait, so according to my earlier calculation, v_max^2 is:

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (2x + x² ) ] / (1 + x )^2 , where x = (kA²)/(2 m c² )

Which is c^2 * (x (2 + x )) / (1 + x )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

But option D is:

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 )

Which, when we expand 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2:

= [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] / (1 + x )^2

= (1 + 2x + x^2 -1 ) / (1 + x )^2

= (2x + x^2 ) / (1 + x )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2x + x^2 ) / (1 + x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x(2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

Which matches my expression.

So option D is v_max = c * sqrt( (2x +x²)/(1+x)^2 ), where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Which is the same as the expression I derived.

So, the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D says:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is indeed the same as what I derived. So the answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation principles.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes both potential energy and relativistic kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), all energy is potential energy:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is relativistic kinetic energy:  
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Equating Energies**:  
   At equilibrium, the potential energy equals the kinetic energy:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor is defined as \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( \gamma \) into this expression:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_{\text{max}}^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides and rearranging for \( v_{\text{max}}^2 \):  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{v_{\text{max}}^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   Therefore:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is consistent with the relativistic energy conservation principles and matches the derived expression. 

**Answer: D**
