Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, it's Wien's Law, which says lambda_max * T = constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same? Because the constant is the same for both, so T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Both stars have the same peak wavelength, so same temperature. But their masses and radii are different. So how does that affect their luminosity? I remember that the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same T, the luminosity depends on R squared. So let's see, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 would be (1.5 R2)^2 σ T^4 * 4π, and L2 is (R2)^2 σ T^4 * 4π. So the ratio L1/L2 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would be option A, ~2.25. But wait, the question says "assuming the stars radiate as black bodies". Oh, that's consistent with using the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect the luminosity? Hmm. Radial velocity relates to the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards or away from us, its emitted light is blueshifted or redshifted. But wait, the peak wavelength is measured as the same. Oh, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, meaning that the Doppler shift is taken into account.

Wait, so if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, that might cause a Doppler shift in its spectrum. But the peak wavelength observed would be the same as Star_1's. Hmm, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same. So that implies that any Doppler shifting due to velocity causes their observed peak wavelengths to be the same. 

But wait, the temperature of each star is determined by their rest frame, right? Because the spectral lines' rest frame would be at the star's own temperature. So if Star_2 is moving, its emitted light would have a different observed wavelength, but the problem says the observed wavelength is the same. So perhaps this affects the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think. When a star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted; away, redshifted. The peak wavelength observed (lambda_obs) is related to the rest frame lambda_rest by the Doppler shift formula. So if a star is moving with radial velocity v, then lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ) ), I think. Or is it (1 + v/c) for v<<c? Or maybe it's (1 + (v/c)) for non-relativistic speeds. Wait, but 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so 700 is about 0.23% of c, so maybe the approximation isn't too bad.
