Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. So the question says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And the mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. It's an isolated system, so energy considerations are important here.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system. Oh wait, minimum energy. So I think I need to calculate the electric potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, but how? I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is given by the formula U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, but when there are multiple charges, it's a bit more involved. Oh right, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But since all the charges are the same, I can probably find a pattern or formula.

So there are 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. So the potential energy is the sum of the interactions between each of the 12 and the 13th, plus the interactions between the 12 themselves.

Wait, but if the 12 are at the same distance from P, but their positions relative to each other matter. Oh wait, but if they are all at 2 meters from P, then each pair among the 12 is separated by some distance. Wait, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, like, are the 12 charges arranged in a circle around P, equally spaced? Or maybe they're all at the same point? Wait, no, if they were all at the same point, the potential energy would be very different. But since the problem says each is at 2m from P, perhaps they're arranged in a sphere or something. But wait, without knowing their exact positions relative to each other, I can't find the exact potential energy between each pair. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that doesn't make sense because then the potential energy would be undefined due to infinite charges at a point. Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances can be considered as if they're in a uniform distribution, but without more information, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the potential energy considering each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and ignore the interactions between the 12. But wait, that can't be right because the potential energy between the 12 is definitely part of the total.

Wait, but maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 are at a fixed distance from P, but their mutual distances are negligible compared to 2m. Or perhaps they are so arranged that each is at 2m from P but at a distance that makes their mutual potential negligible. Hmm, but without specific information, I might have to make an assumption here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed so that all the charges are at the same distance from each other as from P? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are placed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, and the central charge is at P, which is the center of the sphere. Then, the mutual distances between the 12 charges can be calculated based on the radius.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify that, but perhaps it's implied. Without any other information, perhaps I should assume that the 12 charges are placed in such a way that their mutual potential energies can be calculated using the same radius. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the mutual interactions are to be considered, but perhaps the problem is set up so that the only interactions are between each of the 12 and the central charge.

Wait, but that can't be right because a system of multiple particles has potential energy from all pairs. So perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge, and sum them all, but ignore the interactions between the 12 themselves. But that seems like an oversight because mutual interactions would contribute to the total energy.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are 2m as well. Like, they form a regular dodecahedron or something, but without knowing that, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual interactions and only consider the central charge and each of the 12 charges. Because otherwise, the problem becomes too complicated without more information.

Wait, the question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the system is arranged in the most stable configuration, which might mean that the mutual repulsions are minimized. But wait, all the charges are the same sign, so they repel each other. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy, but that's not applicable here because their positions are fixed at 2m from P. So perhaps it's fixed, and the system's energy is determined by the potential energies between each pair.

But again, without knowing the exact arrangement, it's unclear. Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question, and the mutual potential energies between the 12 are not considered. Let me read the question again.

The problem says, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 12 are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary. However, without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem expects me to consider only the potential energy between each of the 12 and the central charge. Because otherwise, we don't have enough info.

So perhaps the potential energy of the system is just the sum of the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12. Because if their mutual distances aren't given, we can't calculate that part. But that would mean I'm neglecting the energy between the 12 themselves, which is a big part.

Wait, but in the case of electric potential energy, the formula for the system is the sum over all pairs. So the total energy U is the sum of U between each pair. So each pair would contribute U_ij = k * (q_i * q_j) / r_ij.

But in this problem, since all the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not given. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and not considering the interactions between the 12. Because without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to compute the mutual potential energies accurately.

So perhaps the approach is to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the central charge, and sum those. Let me proceed with that.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance r = 2m from P, which holds the 13th charge. Each charge is 2e in magnitude, so the product q1*q2 between the 13th and any of the 12 is (2e)(2e) = 4e². So each such pair contributes k*(4e²)/(2) to the potential energy.

Wait, but wait. Electric potential energy for a pair of point charges is U = k * (q1 q2) / r. Since each of the 12 charges is 2e and the central charge is 2e as well, each of these pairs (13th and each of the 12) contributes U = k*(2e * 2e)/(2m).

Wait, the problem says each has charge 2e, so q1 = q2 = 2e? Or is the central charge something else? Wait, no: the question says all 13 charges are identical with charge 2e. So the 13th is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e as well. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of k*(2e * 2e) / (2m) with the central charge.

So each pair contributes (k * (4e²)) / (2m) = (2 k e²) / m. Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy from these interactions is 12 * (2 k e² / 2) = 12 * (k e²) / 1 m. Wait, wait, let me recheck the math.

Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the central charge. So each such pair contributes U = k*(2e * 2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/2 = 2 k e². So each pair contributes 2 k e². So 12 pairs contribute 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, is that correct? Because the formula for the potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So each pair is (2e)(2e)/(2m) multiplied by k.

Wait, let's compute it step by step. Let me write the values:

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is located. So for each of these 12 charges, the potential energy with the central charge is U_i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2).

So that's U_i = k * (4e²) / (2) = 2 k e² per charge.

So for 12 charges, the total U is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, wait. Oh, wait, that's not correct because each pair is counted once. So the 12 charges each contribute a U of 2 k e², so 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, no, the formula is correct because each pair is unique. So 12 pairs, each with U=2 k e², so 24 k e² total for these interactions.

But the problem is, the question asks for the minimum energy of the system. So I have to consider all possible interactions, but I don't have information about the mutual distances between the 12 charges. Hmm, that's a problem. Because the mutual potential energy between the 12 is also part of the total energy.

Wait, but perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would make the potential energy between them approach infinity, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual distance is 2 meters as well. But that doesn't make sense for 12 points on a sphere of radius 2 meters. The distance between any two points on the sphere would vary, depending on their positions. So without knowing the exact arrangement, I can't compute the mutual potential energies.

Hmm, maybe the problem is designed such that the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are negligible, or perhaps they are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are large, making those terms small. But without knowing that, I can't proceed.

Wait, alternatively, maybe the mutual potential energies are to be neglected, and only the interactions with the central charge are considered. But in that case, the problem would be too easy, but let's see.

So if I proceed under that assumption, the total potential energy is 24 k e².

But wait, let's compute this. Let me get the numerical values in order.

Given that:

k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs.

So let's compute 24 * k * e^2.

Compute e squared first: (1.602e-19 C)^2 ≈ 2.566e-38 C².

Then, 24 * 8.988e9 N·m²/C² * 2.566e-38 C².

Calculating 24 * 8.988e9 ≈ 215.712e9 ≈ 2.15712e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 5.543e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, let me do the exact calculation step by step.

Compute 24 * k * e²:

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C²

e² = (1.602e-19
