Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. It's about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me read through the question again and try to figure it out step by step.

So, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, the peak wavelength—I think that relates to the star's temperature. Then, the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. Hmm, radial velocity probably affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect, but I'm not sure yet how that ties in.

The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. The options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, C) 2.35, D) 2.23.

Alright, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Oh but wait, the problem says to assume they radiate as black bodies, so that's correct.

So, since both stars have the same peak wavelength, that should mean they have the same temperature. Because the peak wavelength of a black body is determined by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures T are the same. So, T1 = T2.

Got it. So both stars have the same temperature. Now, let's compute the luminosity ratio. Luminosity is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, the ratio L1/L2 will be (R1² T^4) / (R2² T^4) ) = (R1/R2)^2.

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. Then, why are the options not just 2.25? Because option A is that, but others are close.

Wait, but wait a second. Radial velocities are given—0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. How does that affect anything? Hmm, radial velocity would cause a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So does that mean that their observed wavelengths (λ_obs) are the same?

Wait, Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T. But if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength will shift. So if Star_2 is moving with a radial velocity, its observed λ_max would be different from its actual λ_max.

Wait, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So any Doppler shift must have adjusted their actual λ_max to make the observed λ_max the same.

Hmm, so Star_2 has a radial velocity, which could be blueshift or redshift. Let me think. If Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed λ_max would be shorter (blueshifted), and if moving away, longer (redshifted). But if the observed λ_max is the same as Star_1, which has radial velocity zero, then the actual temperatures may differ, but the Doppler effect makes it look like the same λ_max.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the Doppler effect on the wavelength. The Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much smaller than the speed of light, so using the approximation. Alternatively, for non-relativistic speeds, the shift is Δλ / λ ≈ v_r / c, but I'm not sure. Let me get the exact formula.

The relativistic Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity (positive if moving away, negative if towards). But since v is given as 700 km/s, let me see if that's significant compared to the speed of light. The speed of light is about 3e5 km/s. So 700 / 3e5 is about 0.0023, so non-relativistic. So maybe the approximation is okay.

So, for small v, the Doppler shift can be approximated as:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

Wait, no. Another approximation is λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is positive for recession. Alternatively, another approximation is λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity towards the observer (if v is negative, it's blueshift). Wait, I might get confused. Let me think again.

The exact formula for Doppler shift when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But when v is much less than c, this can be approximated using a Taylor expansion. Let me expand sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ), where x = v/c.

So, (1 + x)/(1 - x) ≈ (1 + x)(1 + x + x² + ... ) ≈ 1 + 2x + 2x² + ... for small x.

Wait, wait, another approach. For small x (x << 1), the expression sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) can be approximated. Let me write x = v/(c). So,

sqrt( (1 + x)/(1 - x) ) ≈ 1 + x + (x²)/2 + ... 

Wait, perhaps a better way is to use log expansion. Let me take natural logs. Let me call the ratio λ_obs / λ_rest = K.

ln K ≈ 0.5 [ ln(1 + x) - ln(1 - x) ]

≈ 0.5 [ (x - x²/2 + x^3/3 - ...) - (-x - x²/2 - x^3/3 - ... ) ]

= 0.5 [ x - x²/2 + x^3/3 + x + x²/2 + x^3/3 + ... ]

= 0.5 [ 2x + (2x^3)/3 + ... ]

= x + (x^3)/3 + ... 

So for small x, ln K ≈ x.

So K ≈ e^{x} ≈ 1 + x, where x = v/(c).

Wait, but the Doppler shift when the source is moving towards us (v is negative) would cause a blueshift, so λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c ), but I need to be careful with signs. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of redshift z.

The redshift z is defined as (λ_obs - λ_rest) / λ_rest. For a source moving away, λ_obs > λ_rest, so z positive. For moving towards, z is negative.

The Doppler shift formula for z is:

1 + z = sqrt( (1 + v/c )/(1 - v/c ) )

But again, for small velocities, z ≈ v/c. So, if the star is moving towards us (v negative), z is negative, so λ_obs = λ_rest (1 + z) would be less than λ_rest.

But in our problem, both stars have the same observed λ_max. Let me denote T1 and T2 as the actual temperatures of Star_1 and Star_2.

Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so observed λ_max_1 = b / T1.

Star_2 has radial velocity v = 700 km/s. Let's assume it's moving away. So its observed λ_max_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v/c). But wait, the actual λ_rest_2 is b / T2.

Wait, but the observed λ_max_2 is the same as observed λ_max_1. So,

λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.

But λ_obs_1 = b / T1.

λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * Doppler factor. Since Star_2 is moving away, the Doppler factor would increase λ_rest_2. So,

λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

So, λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v/c) = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c).

Since λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2,

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v/c )

Simplify: 1 / T1 = (1 / T2) (1 + v/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

But wait, let me make sure about the direction. If Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then the observed wavelength would be longer than its rest wavelength. So for Star_2's rest wavelength λ_rest_2 = b/T2. Observed is (b/T2) * (1 + v/c ), so larger than λ_rest_2.

But Star_1's observed λ is b/T1. So for Star_2's observed λ to equal Star_1's observed λ, (b/T2)(1 + v/c) = b/T1.

Cancel b, get 1/(T2) (1 + v/c) = 1/T1 → T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

Wait, that would make T1 lower than T2. Because 1 + v/c is greater than 1, so denominator is bigger, making T1 smaller.

But earlier I thought that both stars have the same temperature because their observed λ_max is the same. But no, because the observed λ_max for Star_2 is affected by the Doppler shift, so their actual temperatures may differ.

So, solving for T1 in terms of T2.

Let me compute (1 + v/c ) where v is 700 km/s.

v =700 km/s. The speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

So v/c = 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = 7/300 ≈ 0.023333...

So, 1 + v/c ≈ 1.023333.

So, T1 = T2 / 1.023333 ≈ T2 * 0.977.

So T1 is about 0.977 T2.

Wait, so the actual temperature of Star_1 is lower than that of Star_2. But the observed λ_max is same because the Doppler shift compensates for the temperature difference.

Now, the luminosity ratio is L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

T1 = 0.977 T2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )² ( (0.977 T2 )^4 )) / ( R2² T2^4 )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) (0.977^4 T2^4 )) / ( R2² T2^4 )

The R2² and T2^4 terms cancel out.

So,

= 2.25 * (0.977)^4.

Let me compute (0.977)^4.

0.977^2 is approximately (1 - 0.023)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.000529 ≈ 0.9545.

Then, 0.9545 squared is about (0.95)^2 = 0.9025, but more accurately:

0.9545 * 0.9545 = 

Let me compute: 0.9545 * 0.9545.

= (0.95 + 0.0045)^2.

= 0.95² + 2 * 0.95 * 0.0045 + 0.0045².

= 0.9025 + 0.00855 + 0.00002025 ≈ 0.91107.

Wait, wait, 0.95^2 is 0.9025. 0.0045 * 2 *0.95 = 0.00855. 0.0045^2 is 0.00002025. So adding all together: 0.9025 + 0.00855 = 0.91105, plus 0.00002025 gives about 0.91107025. So approximately 0.91107.

So 0.977^4 ≈ 0.91107.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91107 ≈ Let's calculate that.

2.25 * 0.91107.

2 * 0.91107=1.82214.

0.25 * 0.91107=0.2277675.

Adding, 1.82214 + 0.2277675=2.05. Wait, 1.82214 + 0.2277675 = 2.0499075, approximately 2.05.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.25 * 0.911 is about 2.05.

Wait, but that would mean L1 is about 2.05 times L2. But the options are around 2.23, 2.25, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the Doppler effect.

I thought that because Star_2 is moving away (v positive), the observed λ is longer, so the observed λ is (1 + v/c) times the rest λ.

Wait, but in the equation:

λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c) → for receding (v positive).

But for the star emitting λ_rest, if it's moving towards us, v is negative, so λ_obs would be less than λ_rest, making it blueshifted.

But in our case, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. It doesn't specify direction, but in astronomy, radial velocities are given as positive for moving away, I think.

So Star_2 is moving away, so its observed λ_max is longer than its rest λ_max.

But Star_1's observed λ_max is same as Star_2's observed λ_max. So,

λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2 → λ_rest_1 * (1 + v1/c) = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c )

But Star_1 has v1=0, so:

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v2/c )

Because Star_2 is moving away, v2 is positive, so (1 + v2/c) is greater than 1. So λ_rest_1 is longer than λ_rest_2.

Wait, but λ_rest is inversely proportional to temperature. So, λ_rest_1 = b / T1; λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v2/c )

Cancel b: 1/T1 = (1/T2)(1 + v2/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v2/c )

So T1 is lower than T2, as I thought earlier.

So, I think my earlier approach is correct.

So, let's recalculate (0.977)^4.

Let me compute 0.977^2:

0.977 * 0.977.

Let me compute 977 * 977.

Well, 977^2 = ?

Well, (1000 - 23)^2 = 1000000 - 2*1000*23 + 23^2 = 1e6 -46,000 +529= 954,529.

So 0.977^2 = 0.954529.

Now, 0.954529^2 is (0.954529)^2.

Again, (0.95)^2 is 0.9025. Let me compute accurately.

0.954529 * 0.954529:

= (0.95 + 0.004529)^2.

= 0.95² + 2 * 0.95 * 0.004529 + (0.004529)^2.

= 0.9025 + 0.0085982 + 0.0000205.

Add them up:

0.9025 + 0.0085982 = 0.9110982.

Plus 0.0000205 → 0.9111187.

So 0.977^4 ≈ 0.9111187.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9111187 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9111187.

2.25 * 0.9 = 2.025.

2.25 * 0.0111187 ≈ 0.025.

So total ≈ 2.05.

Wait, that's about 2.05, but the options are around 2.23 or 2.35. That's a problem. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler shift formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the observed λ_max is the same, so the effective temperatures are different, but the Doppler shift leads to the same observed λ_max.

Wait, perhaps I should compute T1 and T2 more accurately.

Wait, let's re-express the Doppler effect correctly.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by:

λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But since v is much smaller than c, perhaps using the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v/c )

Wait, but that's for the non-relativistic case.

So, for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of v =700 km/s, which is 700,000 m/s. c is about 3e8 m/s. So v/c is 700,000 / 3e8 = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333.

So, the Doppler factor for Star_2 is (1 + v/c) = 1.023333.

So, λ_obs_2 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v/c )

But λ_obs_1 = λ_rest_1 (since Star_1 has v=0).

We are told that λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.

So,

λ_rest_1 = λ_rest_2 * (1 + v/c )

But λ_rest_1 = b / T1.

λ_rest_2 = b / T2.

So,

b / T1 = (b / T2 ) * (1 + v/c )

Cancel b:

1 / T1 = (1 / T2 ) * (1 + v/c )

→ T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

So, T1 = T2 / (1.023333) ≈ T2 * 0.97707.

So, T1 is approximately 0.97707 T2.

Now, luminosity ratio L1 / L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

= ( (1.5 R2 )^2 * (0.97707 T2 )^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

= (2.25 R2²) * ( (0.97707)^4 T2^4 ) ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )

Simplify: 2.25 * (0.97707)^4.

Now compute (0.97707)^4.

Let me compute 0.97707^2 first.

0.97707 * 0.97707.

Let me compute 977.07 * 977.07 and then adjust for the decimal.

Wait, 977.07 is 97707/100.

977.07^2 = (977 + 0.07)^2 = 977^2 + 2*(977)*(0.07) + (0.07)^2.

977^2 = 954,529.

2 *977 *0.07 = 2 *68.39 = 136.78.

(0.07)^2 = 0.0049.

So sum: 954529 + 136.78 = 954,665.78 + 0.0049 = 954,665.7849.

So, 977.07^2 = 954,665.7849 → 977.07^2 = 954665.7849.

But wait, wait, no, 977.07 is a number multiplied by 0.97707^2.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me compute 0.97707^2 numerically.

0.97707 * 0.97707.

Let me compute:

0.97 * 0.97 = 0.9409.

0.97 * 0.00707 = 0.0068479.

0.00707 * 0.97 = same as above.

0.00707 * 0.00707 = approx 0.00004998.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute it step by step.

Compute 0.97707 * 0.97707:

= (0.9 + 0.07707) * (0.9 + 0.07707)

= 0.9^2 + 2 *0.9 *0.07707 + 0.07707^2.

= 0.81 + 2*0.9*0.07707 + (0.07707)^2.

Compute each term:

0.9 *0.07707 = 0.069363 → 2 * 0.069363 = 0.138726.

0.07707^2: 0.077^2 is 0.005929, and 0.00007^2 is negligible, but let's compute more accurately.

0.07707 * 0.07707 = 

Breakdown:

0.07 * 0.07 = 0.0049.

0.07 *0.00707 = 0.0004949.

0.00707 *0.07 = same as above → 0.0004949.

0.00707 *0.00707 ≈ 0.00004998.

Adding these up:

0.0049 + 0.0004949 +0.0004949 + 0.00004998 ≈ 0.0049 + 0.0009898 + 0.00004998 ≈ 0.00593978.

So,

0.9^2 =0.81.

+ 0.138726 → 0.948726.

+ 0.00593978 → 0.95466578.

So, 0.97707^2 ≈ 0.95466578.

Now, square that again to get to the fourth power.

0.95466578^2.

Again, let me compute this.

= (0.95 + 0.00466578)^2.

= 0.95^2 + 2 *0.95 *0.00466578 + (0.00466578)^2.

0.95^2 = 0.9025.

2 *0.95 *0.00466578 = 1.9 *0.00466578 ≈ 0.008865.

(0.00466578)^2 ≈ 0.00002176.

So sum:

0.9025 + 0.008865 = 0.911365.

+0.00002176 → ~0.91138676.

So, (0.97707)^4 ≈ 0.91138676.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.91138676 ≈ ?

Let me compute 2.25 * 0.91138676.

2 * 0.91138676 = 1.82277352.

0.25 *0.91138676 = 0.22784669.

Adding both:
