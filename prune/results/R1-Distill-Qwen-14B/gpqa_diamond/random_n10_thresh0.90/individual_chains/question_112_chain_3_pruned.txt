Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem says: Let |alpha> be the state describing an electron, proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator, whose matrix representation has elements A_ij. The A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Oh, and also find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should start by normalizing the state |alpha>. Because when given a state proportional to something, you have to find the normalization constant.

The given state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me write this as a vector. So in the basis of |up> and |down>, the state is a two-component vector: [1+i, 2-i].

To normalize this, I need to compute the norm squared, which is the sum of the absolute squares of each component.

So the first component is (1+i). The absolute value squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because |a + ib|^2 is a^2 + b^2.

The second component is (2 - i). The absolute value squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Wait, actually, the question says "proportional", so that's why I have to normalize it.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j and 0 otherwise. So it's a 2x2 matrix because we're talking about spin up and down.

So the matrix would be:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0 ]

Because for i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements are 0.

Wait, that's correct because for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal is when i=j, so those are zero, and the off-diagonal are i≠j, so they are hbar/2.

So this matrix represents the operator. Now, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of this 2x2 matrix. Let me find those eigenstates.

The matrix is [[0, (hbar/2)], [(hbar/2), 0]]

The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A - λI) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ^2 - (hbar^2 /4) = 0.

So λ^2 = hbar^2 /4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The corresponding eigenvectors can be found. Let's take the first eigenvalue λ = hbar/2.

Then (A - (hbar/2) I) v = 0:

[-hbar/2, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

So the equations are:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + (hbar/2) I) v =0:

[hbar/2, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, hbar/2 ]

Which gives v1 + v2 =0 → v1 = -v2. So eigenvectors are proportional to (1, -1).

So the eigenstates of the operator are |+x> and |−x> perhaps? Because the Pauli X matrix has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

Wait, but our operator here is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = (hbar/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates are indeed (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), each multiplied by (hbar/2), but wait, no, the eigenstates are the same as the Pauli X matrix because it's scaled by a factor. The eigenstates only depend on the direction, not the scaling.

So the eigenstates of the operator A are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, but I should confirm that.

Alternatively, if I compute the eigenvectors, the first eigenvector for λ = hbar/2 is any scalar multiple of (1,1), so in terms of |up> and |down>, it would be (1,1) scaled by 1/sqrt(2), so (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, the other eigenvector is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the operator A is diagonal in the basis of |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the state |alpha> is given in the |up>, |down> basis. But the operator A is diagonal in the |+x>, |−x> basis. So to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, and then the coefficients' squares give the probabilities.

So let me write |alpha> in the |+x> and |−x> basis.

But first, let me write |alpha> in the z-basis (which is |up> and |down>). The state is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Expressed as a vector, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

Now, to find the expansion in the |+x> and |−x> basis, I can compute the inner product of |alpha> with each of these states.

The |+x> state is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so its components are (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

The |-x> state is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with components (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> is:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)(1/sqrt(2)) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

(1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ]

Simplify the numerator:

1 + i +2 -i = 3

So coefficient for |+x> is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, the inner product with |-x> is:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)(-1/sqrt(2)) ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute numerator:

1 + i -2 + i = (-1) + 2i.

So coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, for the inner product with |-x>, the components are (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)). So:

(1+i)*1/sqrt(2) + (2-i)*(-1/sqrt(2)) = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

[ (1 + i) -2 + i ] = (1-2) + (i +i ) → (-1) + 2i.

So yes, numerator is (-1 + 2i).

So the coefficients are:

c_+x = 3/(sqrt(14)),

c_-x = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait. To find the probabilities, I need |c|^2 for each.

So |c_+x|^2 = (3)^2 / (14) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

|c_-x|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.3571.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the coefficient c_-x is (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14), so when we compute |c_-x|^2, it's ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) /14 → (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈0.357.

Wait, but the sum of 9/14 and 5/14 is 14/14 =1, so that's correct.

Hmm, but wait, the options are in decimal, so 9/14
