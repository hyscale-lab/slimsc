Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c·S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π). Okay, I remember that the angular momentum operators have these matrix forms, and their eigenvalues are related to the components of spin.

So the matrix S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, I think that's the standard form for the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And S is probably σ_y here because the given matrix matches the structure of the Pauli Y matrix.

Wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], right? So S must be the Pauli Y matrix. So A_y is c multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. Since c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I remember that eigenvalues of a matrix satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

So let's compute the characteristic equation. The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) times S, so when we write Ay - a I, it's (h/(4π)) S - a I.

The determinant of that should be zero. Let me compute the determinant. For a 2x2 matrix [[a, b],[c, d]], the determinant is ad - bc.

So, the matrix elements would be:

Top left: (h/(4π)) * 0 - a → -a.

Top right: (h/(4π)) * (-i).

Bottom left: (h/(4π)) * i.

Bottom right: (h/(4π)) * 0 - a → -a.

So the determinant is [(-a)(-a)] - [ (h/(4π) * (-i)) * (h/(4π) * i) ]

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

The determinant is [ (-a)(-a) ] - [ ( (-i h/(4π)) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ) ]

So that's a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Wait, i * (-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is [ (i)(-i) ) → -i² = 1. So (-i)(i) is 1. So the term is (1) * (h/(4π))².

So determinant is a² - (h/(4π))² * 1 = 0.

So equation is a² = (h/(4π))² → a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait a second. The Pauli matrix S (which is σ_y) has eigenvalues ±1, right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So when we multiply by a constant c, the eigenvalues of A_y would be c times the eigenvalues of S. Since S has eigenvalues ±1, A_y would have eigenvalues c*(±1) = ±c = ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Oh, so the eigenvalues are real numbers. That's interesting because the Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues, but wait, wait, no. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so they have real eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait, let's look at the options. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or something, but that doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So options A and B are probably incorrect because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +2πh or –2πh. But wait, the eigenvalues are real, so the imaginary part is zero. So A can't be correct. Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, which also suggests complex eigenvalues, but our calculation shows that eigenvalues are real. So B is also incorrect.

Looking at the other options, options C and D. Let's think about their statements.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of any component of angular momentum will also be eigenfunctions of the square of the angular momentum. Because [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z or something like that, but A² commutes with each component. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it is also an eigenfunction of A². But what about Az? The eigenfunctions of Ay and Az are not the same, because [Ay, Az] = iħ A_x, I think, so they don't commute. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az. So option C seems correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. The basis functions for the matrix operator are typically the eigenfunctions. So if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the eigenfunctions are the basis. So D could be correct.

Wait, but let me think more carefully. The matrix operator Ay is given, so the eigenvectors would form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So their statement in D is correct. So both options C and D could be correct. Hmm.

Wait, but looking back, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's think about each option's correctness.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So, since A² is a Casimir operator, it commutes with all components, so any eigenstate of a component is an eigenstate of A². So C's first part is correct. The second part, can they also be eigenfunctions of Az? Well, no, because Ay and Az don't commute. So φ can't be an eigenfunction of both Ay and Az simultaneously unless it's a simultaneous eigenfunction. So C's statement is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors (once normalized) form an orthonormal basis. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So both C and D seem correct. Hmm. Let me read the options again.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps let's reevaluate.

Wait, the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so its eigenvectors must form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So the eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator, so option D is correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. So let's go back.

The matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by c=h/(4π), the eigenvalues of Ay are ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real, so any statement suggesting complex eigenvalues is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

Now, for the eigenvectors: since Ay is Hermitian (as it's proportional to a Hermitian matrix), its eigenvectors are orthogonal. So the eigenfunctions form a basis set. So option D is correct.

Now, option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Since A² is (Ay² + Az² + Ax²), and A² commutes with each component, any eigenfunction of Ay is also an eigenfunction of A². So the first part of C is correct. The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. So that's correct because Ay and Az don't commute, so you can't have a state that's an eigenfunction of both. So C is correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So both C and D could be correct. But looking back, the options are:

C) The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

D) The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So if both C and D are correct, but I have to choose the correct option.

Wait, but let me consider if the eigenfunctions of Ay are the same as the basis functions of Ay. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but I'm not familiar with the exact terminology. The eigenfunctions of the operator form a basis for the operator? Or for the space? Well, the eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix, if diagonalizable, form a basis for the space. So yes, D is correct.

So in the options, C and D are both correct statements.

Wait but the options are A, B, C, D, and I think only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating the eigenvalues.

Wait, let me re-examine the calculation.

The eigenvalues come from det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Ay is (h/(4π)) S, where S is the Pauli Y matrix.

The Pauli Y matrix S has eigenvalues ±1.

So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues are ±c = ±h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, not complex. So options A and B are wrong because they suggest non-zero imaginary parts.

So among the given options, the correct statements are C and D.

But let's read the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

So the question is, which of these is correct.

I think both are correct, but let me think again.

Wait, wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of any component
