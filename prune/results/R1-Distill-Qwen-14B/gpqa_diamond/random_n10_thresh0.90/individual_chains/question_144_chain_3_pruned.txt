Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. The question is about a meson resonance called X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.

I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay properties depend on their energy, mass, and width. The mean decay distance probably relates to how far the meson travels before decaying. I think this involves the concept of particle lifetime and speed. Oh right, because the decay distance is the product of velocity and lifetime.

Wait, so the formula for mean decay distance (L) is L = v * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. But how do I find τ? I recall that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Specifically, τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

But wait, let me get that right. The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Oh, okay, so that makes sense.

Now I need to compute τ first. But I also need the velocity v of the meson. How do I find v? Well, the meson is moving with some energy. I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². 

Wait, but in this case, the production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV. The mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. Hmm, so substituting these values, I can find the momentum p.

Let me convert the units into a consistent form. Let's work in units where c=1 for simplicity, but I'll have to remember to account for units when calculating the actual velocity.

So E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. Then E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let me rearrange for p.

p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c^2?

Wait, no, let me do the algebra correctly. The equation is:

E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)²

So (pc)^2 = E² - (mc²)^2

Divide both sides by c²:

p² c² = E² - (mc²)^2 → p² = (E² - (mc²)^2)/(c^4)

Wait, perhaps I should compute p as sqrt(E² - m²c^4) / c.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write E in terms of mass and momentum. Let's see, in natural units (GeV and GeV/c units), E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2. But when you work in units where c=1, E is in GeV, p is in GeV/c, m is in GeV/c². Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the beta factor, which is v/c.

So, beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)}. Let me compute that.

Given E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV. But wait, I think E here is the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic. So m c² is 1.2 GeV, E is 8 GeV.

So, beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ) = sqrt(1 - ( (1.2 GeV)^2 ) / (8 GeV)^2 )

Wait, but actually, E is in GeV, and m c² is also in GeV. So the ratio is (1.2)^2 / (8)^2 = (1.44)/(64) = 0.0225.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

Wait, that's the beta. So v = beta c ≈ 0.9887 * c.

Okay, so now I have the velocity. Next, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. Wait, but Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let's make sure the units are correct.

I need to convert Γ into energy units in GeV or in the same units as ħ. Hmm. Also, I need to remember that ħ (h-bar) has units of GeV·s. Wait, let's check the exact value. Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

Yes. So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So Γ is 320 MeV. Oh wait, 320 MeV is 0.320 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.320 GeV) ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.320 ) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 6.582 divided by 0.320 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s.

Now, the mean decay distance L is v * τ.

v is approximately 0.9887 c. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

So L = v * τ = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying these together: 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ approximately 6.114.

Wait 2.9661 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.9661 * 2.056875.

Hmm, 2.056875 is about 2.0569.

So 2.9661 * 2.0569 ≈ 2 * 2.9661 is 5.9322, plus 0.0569 * 2.9661.

0.0569 * ~3 = 0.1707, but 2.9661 is a bit less, so perhaps around 0.169. So total is approximately 5.9322 + 0.169 = 6.1012.

So 6.1012e(8-24) = 6.1012e-16 meters.

Wait, but wait what's the exponent? 1e8 * 1e-24 is 1e-16.

So L ≈ 6.10e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them is around 6e-16. The options are about 4e-15 and 5e-15, but wait,
