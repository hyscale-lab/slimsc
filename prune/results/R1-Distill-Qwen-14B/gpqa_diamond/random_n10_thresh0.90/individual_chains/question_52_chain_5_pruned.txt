Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, it's about stars and their spectra, right? So the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't.

Wait, I remember that when a star has spots, its overall temperature changes. Oh right, the effective temperature drops when spots cover part of the surface. In this case, without spots, the Teff is 6000 K, and when 40% of the surface is covered, it drops to 5500 K. But wait, actually, the way the problem is phrased, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's overall brightness would change, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

The key point is the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio R = N1/N2 when spots are present is less than when there are no spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes. So we're looking for R_no_spots / R_with_spots, or R_with_spots / R_no_spots? Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots, so R_with_spots < R_no_spots. So the ratio is lower when there are spots. So the factor would be (R_no_spots / R_with_spots).

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, and T is the temperature.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Hmm, so the energy difference between the two levels is E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that. Wait, but maybe I don't need the exact value because it will cancel out in the ratio.

Wait, the ratio of the populations is given by R = (N1)/(N2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Because the formula is (lower level)/(upper level) = (g1/g2) exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ). So if the energy level 2 is higher than level 1, then higher temperature would lead to more excitation, so higher ratio? Wait, no. Let me think. If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So exp(- (E2-E1)/(k T)) would decrease as T increases. So higher T would make the ratio N1/N2 smaller, because the exponent is negative. So when T increases, the ratio N1/N2 decreases.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K, which is lower than 6000 K. So in that case, T decreases. Let me think about how R (N1/N2) changes with T. Since
