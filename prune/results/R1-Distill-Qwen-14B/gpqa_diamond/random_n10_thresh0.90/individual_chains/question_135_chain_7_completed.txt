Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. We need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order.

First, I remember that when a boson decays, the decay products must have masses such that their combined mass is less than the mass of the boson. So the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Looking at the Lagrangian given: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I think that might be a typo or maybe I'm misreading it. Oh wait, perhaps it's L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y))? Hmm, maybe the actual form isn't too important for figuring out the decay products, because the decay products depend on the interactions allowed by the Lagrangian. So the interaction term tells us which fermions X couples to.

In the Lagrangian, I see terms like ψ_f, which are fermion fields. So X couples to fermions f. The form might imply that X is a scalar field because it's written as X(y), not like a vector boson's field strength. So X is a scalar boson.

Now, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So when it decays, it must produce particles whose rest masses are less than or equal to 6 GeV. But wait, each particle's mass has to be less than X's mass divided by two, because the two particles (like a pair) each need to have mass less than X's mass. For example, if X decays into two particles, each must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 3 + 3 = 6 GeV.

Wait, for fermions, each comes in pairs, like a quark and antiquark, or a lepton and antilepton. So the decay would be into a pair of particles with masses less than 3 GeV each. So I need to check which fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV.

Let me list the known fermions and their masses (approximate):

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Top (t): ~173 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.7 GeV

Wait, but wait, quarks are confined, so they can't be produced as free particles. So when a boson decays into quark-antiquark pairs, they form hadrons, but the decay is still considered as possible as long as the quarks are light enough.

But wait, the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays, so it's about the mass requirements, not about whether the quarks are observed directly. So for X to decay into a quark-antiquark pair, each quark's mass must be less than (6 GeV)/2 = 3 GeV.

So which quarks have masses below 3 GeV? Let's see:

u: 0.0022 GeV → yes, much less than 3.

d: 0.0047 GeV → yes.

s: 0.1 GeV → yes.

c: 1.5 GeV → yes, since 1.5 <3.

But b quark has a mass of ~4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV (since 4.7 >3). So X cannot decay into b b-bar, because each b has a mass of about 4.7 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So the sum would be 9.4 GeV, which is way larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So that's not allowed.

Similarly, top quarks are way too heavy, their mass is around 173 GeV, so definitely can't decay into t and t-bar.

So for quarks, allowed are u, d, s, and c. The charm quark is 1.5 GeV, so two of them would sum to 3 GeV, which is okay. So X can decay into c c-bar.

Wait, but wait. The mass of each particle in the pair must be less than or equal to X/2. So for X=6 GeV, each quark must be ≤3 GeV.

Charm is at 1.5 GeV, which is okay. So X can decay into c c-bar.

But bottom quarks are 4.7 GeV each, which is more than 3, so X can't decay into b b-bar.

Now, for leptons:

Each lepton (and their antiparticles) must have mass less than 3 GeV. Let's list the leptons:

- Electron (e): 0.0005 GeV → okay.
- Muon (μ): 0.105 GeV → okay.
- Tau (τ): 1.78 GeV → okay.

So X can decay into e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ-.

Wait, but the tau is 1.78 GeV, so two taus would be 3.56 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV? Wait, no, because 1.78 *2 is 3.56 GeV. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, wait, when the boson X decays into two particles, each particle's mass must be less than or equal to X's mass / 2.

So for each fermion f in the decay X → f f-bar,

m_f ≤ m_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So for a tau, m_tau ≈1.78 GeV <3 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

Same for muons and electrons.

So possible decay channels include:

c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, mu+ mu-.

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? As I thought earlier, b quark is too heavy. So X cannot decay into b b-bar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But since X cannot decay into b b-bar because m_b is 4.7 GeV >3 GeV, Option A is incorrect.

Option B: c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So B includes c c-bar, which is correct, and the leptons, yes.

Wait, but wait: the mass of c is 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so can decay into c c-bar.

But what about the mass of the X boson? If X is 6 GeV, the pair c c-bar would have a combined mass of 3 GeV each, which is 3*2=6 GeV, so exactly equal to X's mass. So that's allowed.

Same for tau: 1.78 *2 =3.56 GeV <6 GeV. So yes.

Option C includes c c-bar and also t t-bar. But wait, t is 173 GeV, way too big. So C can't be right.

Option D includes b b-bar, which we can't have, so D is out.

Wait, so the correct decay channels are c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Wait, let me make sure. Let me think again. The possible fermions are those whose mass is ≤3 GeV.

So for quarks: u (0.0022), d (0.0047), s (0.1), c (1.5) — all are ≤3 GeV. So each can pair produce.

So X can decay into c c-bar, which would have a combined mass of 3 GeV. So that's allowed.

So the possible decay products are:

c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

So option B lists all of these. So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be allowed, the mass of each fermion \( f \) must satisfy \( m_f \leq m_X / 2 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \). Additionally, the interaction term in the Lagrangian indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions \( f \), so the decay products must be fermions that \( X \) interacts with.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Quarks**:
   - \( u \): \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( d \): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( s \): \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( c \): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( b \): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - \( t \): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \)).

2. **Leptons**:
   - \( e \): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \mu \): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - \( \tau \): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

### Allowed Decays:
From the above, the boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), \( e^+\e^- \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c\bar{c} \), \( s\bar{s} \), \( u\bar{u} \), \( d\bar{d} \), \( \tau^+\tau^- \), \( \mu^+\mu^- \), \( e^+\e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( m_t > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.
