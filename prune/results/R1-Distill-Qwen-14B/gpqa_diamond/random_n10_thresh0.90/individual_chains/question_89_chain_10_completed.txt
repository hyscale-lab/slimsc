Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

First, the question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes. Wait, but Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on adjacent carbons? Or wait, 1 and 3 positions in an adamantane structure? Hmm, adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two non-adjacent carbons, perhaps? Wait, no, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 might be adjacent. Wait, maybe I should think about the structure.

Wait, no, the structure of adamantane is such that each carbon is part of three rings. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. I think in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are actually adjacent because of the way the rings are fused. So when KOH is added, it would likely lead to an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. Because KOH is a strong base, it would deprotonate and eliminate the HBr, forming an alkene.

So the product after KOH would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Wait, but wait, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is 1,3-diene, but I'm not too sure. Let me think again about the structure. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings. The 1 and 3 positions are adjacent in the structure, so elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bridge structure.

Wait, after elimination, the product is a white solid. Wait, no, the problem says it's a light yellow solid. So maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, the IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. Oh wait, but wait. If the initial product is from elimination, maybe it's an alkene. But the IR of that product shows a peak at 1720. That's more like a carbonyl, so maybe the first step isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. The initial reaction is KOH and heated. Dihalide reacting with KOH. Oh wait, another possibility is that it's a substitution reaction. But if it's vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Br), substitution would give a diol. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so maybe it's a di-substitution, but since the Br's are not adjacent, perhaps it's more likely to form a diepoxide? No, wait, no, epoxide formation requires an alkene.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the first product. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone. So the product after KOH must have a ketone group. So if I have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but then why a carbonyl?

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is an epoxide. But no, the IR would show an epoxide as a peak around 1250 cm^-1, I think. So not that. Alternatively, maybe the product is a diketone? How would that form?

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a double elimination, forming a bridge structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings, so each bridge is three carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br on two bridged carbons. When treated with KOH, perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent C's form double bonds. So maybe two eliminations occur, each forming a double bond, but given the structure, maybe the product is a norbornene derivative or something similar.

Wait, but then why the IR peak at 1720? That must be a carbonyl. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. Let's think: if each Br leaves, and the adjacent C-O- groups form, but maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates and the Br leaves, but maybe it's a substitution, but that would give a diol. But in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't substitution but elimination followed by something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination, forming a conjugated diene. But the IR would then show C=C peaks, which are around 1600 cm-1, but the given peak is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial product is a ketone. How can that happen? Maybe the base abstracts a proton adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but that would require the base to abstract a β-hydrogen, causing the formation of a double bond. But where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, perhaps I should look at the NMR data. The NMR of product 1 shows 4.79 ppm (2H), which is a singlet, perhaps from an ether or an alcohol. But wait, 4.79 is more like a CH2O group. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests some CH2 groups in a rigid structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) is perhaps a methylene adjacent to something deshielded.

Wait, if product 1 has a carbonyl, perhaps it's an epoxide, but no, the IR doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone. Wait, for a ketone, the carbonyl peak is around 1700-1750, which matches 1720. So the first product must have a ketone group.

Wait, how does a dihalide become a ketone when treated with KOH? Maybe via a double elimination with water. Or perhaps it's a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that requires peracids. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide is treated with a strong base leading to a double dehydrohalogenation, forming a conjugated diene. Oh wait, but then why the carbonyl?

Alternatively, could it be a ring-opening of an epoxide? No, the starting material is dihalide, not an epoxide.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the reaction conditions. KOH, heat. Another possibility is that it's a Fittig reaction, but that typically involves aryl halides and forms a coupling product. Not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form an alkene, but that would not produce a carbonyl. So perhaps the first product is an epoxide? No, because then the IR would show the epoxide peak.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the product as a ketone. How can a dihalide become a ketone? Oh! Wait a minute, if the dihalide is adjacent, then elimination of two equivalents of HBr could form a conjugated diene. But then, if that diene is further reacted with something else... Wait, no, the first step is just KOH and heat. So maybe the initial product is a diene, but then why the IR shows a carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: the IR at 1720 suggests a ketone. So perhaps the product is a ketone, and the starting material is a dihalide. So how to form a ketone from a dihalide with KOH?

Wait, maybe it's a dearomatization or some rearrangement. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a strong base, leading to a double elimination to form a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe a Cope elimination? Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is converted into a diketone. Wait, but that would require two eliminations, each forming a carbonyl. That could be possible if the dihalide is vicinal. But in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the Brs are not vicinal (assuming the structure), so each would form their own carbonyl. Wait, but with two Br on non-adjacent carbons, elimination would form two double bonds, not two ketones.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think of the possible structures. Suppose the product after KOH is a ketone. Then what would the structure be?

Alternatively, let's consider that the product might have an epoxide group, but that doesn't fit with the IR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diol. But if it's a diol, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide and a ketone? No, that seems unlikely from KOH and heat.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of product 1.

The NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet?), 10H in 2.41-2.23 ppm, and 1.94 ppm (2H). The 4.79 region is probably a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe it's a CH2O group, like an ether or an alcohol. But alcohol protons usually show up lower, around 1-2 ppm, depending on the structure. So perhaps it's an ether.

Wait, but if the product is a diol, the 4.79 would be two -OH protons. But in that case, the integration is 2H, so maybe two OH groups. But I don't know. Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal diol, but that would be a single peak with 2H.

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether. So maybe the product is an epoxide? But earlier I thought the IR doesn't fit, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, epoxide IR peaks are around 1250 cm^-1 and 1050 cm^-1, as C-O-C stretching. So the given IR at 1720 is more likely a carbonyl. So back to that.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a ketone but an ester? Or maybe it's a tertiary alcohol? No, because the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl for that.

Wait, maybe the product is a conjugated diene, and the NMR is showing some shift. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a cyclopropane? But I don't see how KOH would do that.

Hmm, maybe I should look at the next steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, product 1 has a ketone group. So if product 1 is a ketone, and we use Al(OiPr)3, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acylation.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone, so maybe it's a cyclic ketone. When treated with a Lewis acid, perhaps it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement. Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that would require an aromatic ring. I'm not sure if adamantane has aromatic properties.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is an epoxide. Because aluminum isopropoxide can be used in epoxidation with peracids, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, another thought: maybe product 1 is a diene, and when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, it undergoes some cycloaddition. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diene, and product 2 is an epoxide. Because Al(OiPr)3 could act as a catalyst for epoxidation. But I'm not certain about that.

Moving on, product 2 is then treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That's a standard ozonolysis followed by workup. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, breaking them into carbonyl groups.

So if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break it into fragments with carbonyls. But the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

But let's think about the structure step by step.

First Reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (with ketone).

So product 1 has a ketone. The NMR of product 1 includes a singlet at 4.79 (2H), which could be from a CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl. For example, in a cyclic ketone, perhaps there's a bridgehead CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: adamantane is a very rigid structure. If product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the molecule becomes a bicyclic ketone, such as bicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one or similar. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, if the initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and elimination of two HBr occurs, forming a double bond. But how would that form a ketone?

Wait, perhaps each Br is eliminated with water, leading to two ketone groups. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diketone adamantane. But I'm not sure about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated diene, which then could undergo some keto-enol tautomerism to form a ketone. But I'm not following.

Wait, maybe the initial elimination forms a diene, and then in the presence of base, it undergoes a keto-enol shift to form a ketone. But I'm not sure about the mechanism.

Alternatively, maybe the product after KOH is a diketone. So, product 1 is a diketone, and when treated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization, forming a ring with ester groups or something else.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me think about the ozonolysis step. Ozonolysis of a diene would cleave it into two carbonyl groups. So if product 2 is a conjugated diene, product 3 would have carbonyls where the double bonds were.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. So perhaps product 3 has some CH2 groups adjacent to carbonyls, which would deshield their protons.

Wait, the most deshielded proton would likely be near an electronegative group, like a carbonyl. The deshielding would cause them to appear downfield. So, in product 3, maybe after ozonolysis, there's a structure with a carbonyl and adjacent CH2 groups.

For example, if the diene in product 2 is a conjugated diene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. If the diene is symmetric, the products would be two identical carbonyl compounds.

So, assuming product 3 is a dialdehyde or a diketone, the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls would have protons that are deshielded. But wait, the question specifies the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those exchanging with solvent.

In the NMR, the most deshielded would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So if each carbonyl is next to a CH2 group, the protons on that CH2 would be split based on neighboring groups.

Wait, but in a typical ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and the carbonyls are formed. So, if the diene was in a bridge structure, ozonolysis might break it into two bridgeheads with carbonyls. Then, the adjacent CH2 groups would have protons that are split by neighboring Hs.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a bicyclic diene. Ozonolysis would cleave it, creating two carbonyl groups. Then, the adjacent CH2 groups would each have two protons. If each CH2 is adjacent to the carbonyl, their protons would couple with neighboring Hs.

But if the original diene was symmetric, then the product would have identical environments on each side. So each CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two Hs that are equivalent.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks a bridge, leading to a structure with a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and the Hs on that CH2 would couple with the Hs on the adjacent carbonyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, what's the coupling pattern? The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Hmm. Let's imagine that after ozonolysis, each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Each CH2 has two Hs. But what's the environment around them?

If the CH2 is next to a carbonyl group, the Hs on CH2 would experience coupling with neighboring Hs. For example, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group, each H would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. But wait, if the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one other CH2, then each H on the CH2 would have two neighboring Hs (from the adjacent CH2). So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but maybe there's more coupling. Alternatively, if each CH2 is next to a CH group or another group with more Hs, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs on the CH2 next to the carbonyl group are each adjacent to two Hs from another group, leading to a triplet of triplets. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: after ozonolysis, the structure might have a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and also next to another CH2 group. So each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. That would give a triplet for each H.

Alternatively, if the structure is such that each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 and possibly another group, the coupling could be more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So each H on the central CH2 would see two Hs from each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the structure in more detail.

First, let's consider the first product. 1,3-dibromoadamantane treated with KOH gives a ketone. So, perhaps the product is a ketone in the adamantane structure.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts. But if product 1 is a ketone, maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Wait, but without an aromatic ring, Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement or some other carbonyl-based reaction.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and product 2 is the result of a ring-opening or some rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and product 2 is an epoxide. But I don't see how the IR would match.

Wait, let's think about the NMR of product 1 again. The 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an epoxide. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, which doesn't fit with an epoxide. So perhaps it's a different functional group.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a gem-diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the steps after product 1.

Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonized to form product 3.

Assuming product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyls. Then, the NMR of product 3 would show the splitting from the Hs adjacent to the carbonyls.

In ozonolysis, the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls would typically have Hs that are split into triplets. Because each H on the CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded H. So perhaps it's the Hs closest to the carbonyl, which are more deshielded. So their coupling would be with the adjacent Hs.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis has each CH2 adjacent to another CH2 and perhaps another group, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, let me think of a specific example. Suppose product 2 is a 1,3-diene in a cyclic structure. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. So, if the diene was part of a six-membered ring, ozonolysis would break the ring into two carbonyls, creating two ketones or aldehydes.

Then, the resulting structure would have CH2 groups next to the carbonyls. The Hs on these CH2 would couple with the neighboring CH2 groups.

For example, if the product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2 in the middle would have Hs that couple with the adjacent CH2 groups. But wait, that's a linear structure, but adamantane is more rigid.

Alternatively, if it's a bridged structure, the Hs might be in a more complex coupling environment.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded Hs are on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH2 would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

But wait, the options include a triplet of triplets. How would that happen?

Ah, perhaps each H on the CH2 is coupled with two adjacent Hs on one side and another set on the other side. So, for example, each H is coupled with two Hs on one adjacent CH2 and two Hs on the other adjacent CH2. That would make each H appear as a doublet of doublets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are coupled with two Hs on one side and another two Hs on the other, but that might lead to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, wait. Let me think of the splitting. For a CH2 group next to another CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with two Hs on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. But if each H is also coupled with another set of Hs elsewhere, the splitting could be more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs are adjacent to two different sets of Hs, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: the coupling pattern depends on the number of neighboring Hs. For a triplet, each H is coupled with two Hs. For a triplet of triplets, each H is coupled with two groups of two Hs.

So, for example, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one group and two Hs from another, leading to (n+1)(m+1) splitting, which would be a triplet of triplets.

In the case of ozonolysis product, perhaps each CH2 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups. So each H on CH2 would couple with two Hs from each of two adjacent CH2 groups.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe the structure is such that each CH2 group is flanked by two other CH2 groups. For example, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2, each central CH2 would have two adjacent CH2 groups on either side. So each H on the central CH2 would couple with two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But in that case, each H would have 4 neighboring Hs (two on each adjacent CH2), but that's not possible because each adjacent CH2 has two Hs. So each H would see two Hs from one side and two from the other, making four. So the splitting would be a quintet (n+1 where n=4), but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the structure isn't linear. Maybe it's a ring. For example, a five-membered ring with two CH2 groups next to each other, each adjacent to another CH2 group. Then, each H on a central CH2 would see two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each H on the CH2 is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group and two from another, but arranged in a way that they are not equivalent. So the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

Let me think again: the most deshielded H is likely on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling would depend on the neighboring groups. If each H on the CH2 is split by two Hs on one side and another two on the other, then it's a triplet of triplets. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are adjacent to a CH group, leading to different splitting. For example, if the CH2 is next to a CH group with two Hs, then each H on CH2 would split into a triplet (coupling with two Hs on CH). But if the CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2 group, then each H would couple with two Hs there, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I think I'm getting too speculative here. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

If the coupling is with two Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting would be (2+1)(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a triplet of triplets. So option B.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with two Hs from one adjacent group, that's a triplet. But if each H is coupled with two Hs from two different groups, that's a triplet of triplets.

So the answer is B) triplet of triplets.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is treatment with KOH at 240°C, which leads to the formation of product 1. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The NMR data for product 1 includes signals at 4.79 ppm (2H, singlet), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H), suggesting a rigid structure with CH₂ groups adjacent to electronegative groups, such as oxygen.

The second step involves heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, to form product 2. While the exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, it is likely a diene or a related structure that can undergo ozonolysis in the next step.

In the third step, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, forming carbonyl-containing products. The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, which is adjacent to a carbonyl group.

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group directly adjacent to a carbonyl group. This hydrogen would couple with neighboring hydrogens, leading to splitting in the NMR spectrum. If the CH₂ group is adjacent to two other CH₂ groups, each hydrogen on the CH₂ would couple with two hydrogens from one side and two hydrogens from the other side. This results in a triplet of triplets coupling pattern.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
