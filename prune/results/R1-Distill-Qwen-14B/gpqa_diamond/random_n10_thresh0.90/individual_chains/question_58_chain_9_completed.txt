Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization. Let me try to remember what each of these theories is about.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations give infinite results, which don't make physical sense. So regularization helps to make these infinities manageable, maybe by introducing a cutoff or something. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or don't have such divergences.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, incorporating gravity. Strings are one-dimensional objects, and they vibrate at different frequencies. Since it's a theory that unites quantum mechanics and general relativity, maybe it's a more fundamental theory. I think in string theory, the concept of divergences is handled differently. Strings have a sort of "built-in" cutoff because their size is related to the string length, so maybe they don't require the same kind of regularization as other quantum field theories. Or wait, do they? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think superstring theory is a theory that is finite, perhaps not needing regularization, but I'm not entirely sure.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD calculations often involve things like renormalization. Because of asymptotic freedom, at low energies quarks behave freely, but at high energies, the coupling becomes strong. Wait, but QCD does require renormalization, which is a form of regularization. So this theory needs regularization. So the question is about which theory never requires it, so B might not be the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I know that QED has processes where infinities pop up, like the electron self-energy or vacuum polarization. These are handled through renormalization, which involves regularization techniques like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization. So C is not the correct answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. That's the non-quantum version, Maxwell's equations and all that. In classical theories, do we have the same issues with divergences? For example, the electric field of a point charge is infinite at the origin, but in classical physics, we just accept that as a mathematical construct. But wait, in a way, does regularization apply here? Because in classical E&M, we don't have the same divergent loop integrals as in quantum theories. Or maybe when you try to compute certain things like the self-energy of a charge in classical electromagnetism, you get divergences. Oh wait, but classical theories don't use regularization in the same way. Because regularization is a quantum field theory tool, used for dealing with divergent integrals that come from loop diagrams. So classical theories don't require regularization because they aren't formulated with the same divergent integrals. So D might be the answer.

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization. So the options are A, B, C, D.

So, looking again:

Superstring Theory (A): I think it doesn't require regularization because its perturbative expansion is finite, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, no, I remember that even in string theory, you have loop diagrams, which can lead to divergences. But because of the higher-dimensional nature and the stringy corrections, maybe the divergences are less severe or absent. Alternatively, perhaps string theory is a theory that doesn't require regularization because it's a background-independent theory, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another angle. Regularization is a part of renormalization, which is a procedure used in quantum field theories with divergences. So which of these theories doesn't have divergences that require renormalization? Or perhaps, which one is a classical theory that doesn't involve these divergences because it's not quantized.

Wait, the question is about which theory 'never' requires regularization. So, the theory that doesn't have any divergences that need to be handled via regularization.

Option D is classical electrodynamics. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't perform the same kind of calculations that lead to divergences in quantum theories. So regularization isn't needed because the theory isn't quantum. But wait, does classical ED have any divergences? For example, the field of a point charge is infinite, but that's a mathematical artifact, not a physical divergence in the theory's calculations.

But regularization is part of quantum field theory because loop integrals can be divergent, leading to infinities in quantities like charge or mass. So in classical ED, you don't have such issues because you don't calculate loop diagrams. So D doesn't require regularization.

But let me think about each option again.

Quantum Electrodynamics (C) definitely requires regularization because of its loop integrals leading to divergences. Same with QCD (B). So the only options left are A and D.

Now, whether superstring theory requires regularization. I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansion is in terms of Feynman diagrams, but the string approach modifies the propagators and vertices in a way that perhaps the divergences are tamed. Or maybe string theory's perturbative series doesn't have the same kind of divergences as QED or QCD. Alternatively, I've heard that in string theory, you don't need to regularize because the theory has a natural cutoff at the string scale. So perhaps it doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in practice, when computing loop diagrams in string theory, especially in certain perturbative expansions, you might still encounter divergences which are dealt with using other techniques. Or maybe string theory is a theory that is finite, so it doesn't require regularization. I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about regularization in the context of each theory:

- QED: Uses regularization (yes)
- QCD: Uses regularization (yes)
- Classical ED: Doesn't use regularization because it's not a quantum theory (no)
- Superstring Theory: I'm not certain, but I think it doesn't require the same kind of regularization as QED or QCD because, in string theory, the infinities are either absent or handled differently. Or perhaps it does require it. Wait, I think in string theory, they do use regularization methods, like using a cutoff or dimensional regularization, to handle loop divergences. So if that's the case, then the correct answer would be D, since it's the only one that doesn't require regularization.

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization. So if classical ED doesn't have the same divergences, then it's the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A, Superstring Theory, because it's a quantum theory but doesn't require regularization. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: which of these theories is a classical theory? D is classical, so it's the only one that's non-quantum. So since regularization is a quantum field technique, D doesn't need it.

So putting it all together, the answer is D: Classical Electrodynamics.


To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze each option:

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring Theory is a quantum theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics. While it deals with loop diagrams and divergences, it introduces concepts like the string length scale, which may help tame divergences. However, regularization techniques are still used in certain contexts within string theory. Thus, it does not entirely avoid regularization.

### Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)  
QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, describing quarks and gluons. It requires renormalization, which is a form of regularization, to handle divergences in loop calculations. Therefore, QCD requires regularization.

### Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)  
QED is the quantum theory of electromagnetism. It is known to have divergences in loop integrals, such as vacuum polarization and electron self-energy, which are addressed through renormalization. Hence, QED requires regularization.

### Option D: Classical Electrodynamics  
Classical Electrodynamics, based on Maxwell's equations, is a non-quantum theory. It does not involve the same divergences that arise in quantum field theories, such as loop integrals or infinities in physical quantities. Regularization is a tool specific to quantum field theory and is not required in classical theories. Therefore, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only Classical Electrodynamics (D) is a theory that never requires regularization at high energies. 

Answer: D
