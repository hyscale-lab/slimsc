--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 10^-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt-containing species.

Wait, what's a stability constant again? Oh right, it's the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex ion. So for each complex, higher β means more stable.

The complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2−n where n is 1, 2, 3, 4. The question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)2^2- complex. So n=2, which has β2=40. But wait, the β values are given for each step. Let me clarify the stability constants.

Stability constants are usually for each successive addition of a ligand. So for Co^2+:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^(+), β1 = [Co(SCN)]+/[Co^2+][SCN^-] =9.

Then, Co(SCN)^(+) + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)2, β2=40, so the overall β for Co(SCN)2 would be β1*β2=9*40=360.

Similarly, β3 is for the next step: Co(SCN)2 + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)3^-, β3=63. So overall β for Co(SCN)3^- is 9*40*63=... let me compute that. 9*40=360, 360*63=22680.

And β4=16 would be for Co(SCN)3^- + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)4^2-, so the overall β4 is 16, which would make the β for Co(SCN)4^2- equal to 9*40*63*16. Let me calculate that: 9*40 is 360, *63 is 22680, *16 is 362880.

Wait, but maybe each β is the overall constant for each complex. Wait, no, I think the way it's presented, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc., so each subsequent β is for adding another SCN-.

So the general approach is to compute the fraction of each complex in solution. The species present are Co^2+ and the various complexes: Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3^-, Co(SCN)4^2−.

The total concentration of Co is the sum of all these species. So, we can model this using the formation of each complex step by step.

The formula for the fraction of each species is based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

I remember that the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is given by:

f_n = (β_n * [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + ... + β1β2...β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but each β is for adding one more ligand. So each step's contribution would be the product of the β's up to that step multiplied by [SCN]^n.

Alternatively, the fractions can be found by considering the distribution of Co species among all possible complexes.

So, the formula for the fraction f of each species is:

f_n = (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of (β1β2...βk [SCN]^k)) )

Wait, but wait. For each complex, the term is the product of β's up to that n. So for n=0, it's just 1 (since Co^2+ has no ligands, so product is empty, which is 1). For n=1, it's β1. For n=2, it's β1*β2, and so on.

So the denominator is the sum over all complexes (including n=0, which is Co^2+ itself) of the products.

So, let's compute each term:

Compute the terms for each n from 0 to 4.

n=0: term0 = 1 * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 = 1.

n=1: term1 = β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

n=2: term2 = β1*β2 [SCN]^2 = 9*40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01=3.6.

n=3: term3 = β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

Let me compute that: 9*40=360, *63=22680. 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

n=4: term4 = β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 = 22680 *16 * (0.1)^4.

22680 *16 = 362880. [0.1]^4 is 0.0001. 362880 * 0.0001 =36.288.

So the terms are:

term0 = 1,

term1 = 0.9,

term2=3.6,

term3=22.68,

term4=36.288.

Sum all these terms: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the sum is 64.468.

Each term is the numerator for the fraction of that species. So the fraction for n=2 is term2 / sum_terms =3.6 /64.468.

Wait, wait. So for each complex, the fraction is termn / sum_terms.

So for n=2, which is Co(SCN)2^2-, the fraction is 3.6 /64.468.

Let me compute that: 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.05558, which is 5.558%.

But wait, the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is the Co(SCN)2^2- complex, which is n=2. So the fraction is approximately 5.56%.

But wait, looking at the options, the closest one I don't see exactly. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, none of them are around 5.5%. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I confused n=2 with another. Maybe the blue complex is n=3 or n=4? Or am I misunderstanding the problem?

Wait, the question states "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands, so n=2. But according to my calculation, that's about 5.5% which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the terms.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given as the overall constants for each complex, not the stepwise. Let me check the problem statement again.

Problem says: stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16. Hmm, wait, the way it's written, it's unclear whether each β is a stepwise constant or the overall. 

Wait, if β1 is the overall for n=1, β2 is overall for n=2, etc., then the fractions would be calculated differently. Let me think.

Wait, normally, stability constants are stepwise. That is, β1 is for adding the first ligand, β2 the second, etc. So the overall β for the complex with n=2 is β1*β2. So my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering each β as the overall β for the complex. Then, for n=1, β1=9, for n=2 β2=40, etc. That would change the approach.

Wait, that would be unusual, but perhaps that's the case. Let me reevaluate.

In that scenario, the termn for each n would be βn * [SCN]^n.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the overall formation constant for n=2 would be β1 * β2, not β2 on its own.

So perhaps the given β's are the overall (cumulative) stability constants for each complex. That is, β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN), β2 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)2, etc.

If that's the case, then the way to compute the fractions would be different.

Wait, but that's not the usual convention. Normally, β's are stepwise, not cumulative. So I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the given β's as the overall constants for each complex. Let's try that approach.

So, for each complex, the formation constant is given as βn for that complex.

So:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_n^(2−n), with K = βn.

Then for each complex, the fraction f_n is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum for k=0 to 4 of (βk [SCN]^k)) )

Wait, but for n=0, it's just Co^2+, so β0=1, and [SCN]^0=1. So term0 = 1 *1=1.

For n=1, term1 = β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: term2=β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3: β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4: β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

So the terms are term0=1, term1=0.9, term2=0.4, term3=0.063, term4=0.0016.

Sum these: 1 + 0.9 =1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169, which is about 16.9%. Oh, that's option D:16.9%.

But wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. If those are the overall stability constants for each complex, then this approach would be correct.

But earlier I thought β's were stepwise, which gave a different answer. So why is this discrepancy?

Because the problem says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16." So each β_n is the overall stability constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

Wait, but that's not how stability constants are typically defined. Usually, β's are stepwise. Let me think about the correct approach.

I think I should proceed assuming that each β is the stepwise constant. So for n=1, β1=9, for n=2, β2=40, etc. Then, the overall β for each complex would be the product up to that n.

So the terms are:

term0 =1,

term1 = β1 [SCN] =9*(0.1)=0.9,

term2=β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9*40*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6,

term3=β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680*(0.001)=22.68,

term4=β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum=1 + 0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468≈0.05558, or ~5.56%.

But that's not any of the options, which suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the blue dithiocyanate complex, which is perhaps the tetrathiocyanato complex, Co(SCN)4^2−, which might be blue. But I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, maybe the blue is for n=3.

Wait, maybe I need to double-check what the blue complex is. I think some cobalt complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)]^+ is pink, [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is blue, [Co(SCN)3]^− is green, and [Co(SCN)4]^2− is blue again, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the colors.

But the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ligands, so [Co(SCN)2]^2+? Or [Co(SCN)2]^2-? Wait, wait, the charge would be 2+ if Co^2+ is with two SCN^- (2-). So 2+ + 2*(-1) =0? No, that can't be. Wait, Co^2+ with two SCN^- would have charge 2+ + 2*(-1) =0. So formula is Co(SCN)2.

Wait, but I think the correct formula is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So for n=2, it's [Co(SCN)2]^0? No, wait, wait. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So for two SCN ligands, total charge is 2+ + 2*(-1) =0. So the complex is neutral. Hmm, but that's unusual. Or perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2−? No, that would be for n=4? Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2−, but that would require Co^2+ with two SCN^-... No, 2+ + 2*(-1) =0, so [Co(SCN)_2] is neutral. Hmm, perhaps that's not likely. Maybe the complexes have different charges.

But wait, perhaps I should focus on the calculation. Since in the first approach (assuming stepwise β's), the fraction for n=2 is ~5.5%, which isn't an option, and in the second approach (assuming each β is the overall constant for that complex), the fraction for n=2 is ~16.9%, which is option D.

But why would the problem give the β's as stepwise? Because that's the standard approach. So perhaps the correct way is the first approach, and the answer isn't matching any option, which suggests I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the terms. Let me recheck.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So for each complex:

n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1*β2 [SCN]^2=9*40 *0.01= 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1β2β3 [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *0.001. 9*40=360, *63=22680. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *0.0001. 9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Summing these: 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.0556 or 5.56%.

Hmm, but that's not matching any option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the percentage of the blue complex, which may be n=4. Let me see.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the colors of the complexes. I think [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is pink, [Co(SCN)3]^− is blue, and [Co(SCN)4]^2− is also blue. Alternatively, perhaps the blue is the tetrathiocyanato complex. So n=4.

So let me calculate the fraction for n=4.

term4=36.288.

Sum is 64.468.

So fraction f4=36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5628, which is about 56.3%. Not among the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the one with n=3. Let me check that.

term3=22.68. So fraction is 22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3518, 35.18%. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the trithiocyanato complex as blue, which would be n=3. But again, 35% isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. But the problem states that, yes, [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

Wait, maybe I should think about the possibility that the cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M and the SCN is much higher, but in this case, SCN is 0.1 M, which is higher than Co's concentration.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the cobalt is in a particular oxidation state or that the solution is in a certain pH, but the problem doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the stability constants are applied is different. Wait, perhaps the total concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, but the SCN is 0.1 M, so the [SCN] is in excess. So the formation of complexes depends on these concentrations.

Wait, another approach: let's model the distribution of the species.

The species are:

Co^2+,

Co(SCN)^+,

Co(SCN)_2^2+,

Co(SCN)_3^-,

Co(SCN)_4^2−.

Each has an associated concentration based on the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The general formula for each species is [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But since β_n is the product of the previous β's, the [Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But the total Co concentration is the sum of all these species:

c_total = [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3] + [Co(SCN)_4].

Each term is:

[Co^2+] = x,

[Co(SCN)] = β1 x [SCN]^1,

[Co(SCN)_2] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2,

[Co(SCN)_3] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3,

[Co(SCN)_4] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4.

So,

x + β1 x [SCN] + β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = c_total.

We can factor x:

x [1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ] = c_total.

So,

x = c_total / [1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 ].

Once we have x, we can find the concentration of each species.

But the problem is that the c_total is 1e-2 M. Wait, but the [SCN] is also given as 0.1 M, which is in excess. So x will be much smaller than the terms in the denominator.

So let's compute the denominator D.

Compute each term:

term0 =1,

term1=β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9,

term2=β1 β2 [SCN]^2=9 *40 *0.01=3.6,

term3=β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3=9 *40 *63 *0.001=22680 *0.001=22.68,

term4=β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4=9 *40 *63 *16 *0.0001=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum D=1+0.9=1.9+3.6=5.5+22.68=28.18+36.288=64.468.

So,

x= (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈1.551e-4 M.

So,

[Co^2+]=x≈1.551e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)]= β1 x [SCN] =9*(1.551e-4)*0.1=1.396e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)2]= β1 β2 x [SCN]^2=9*40 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^2=360 *1.551e-4 *0.01=360 *1.551e-6=5.5836e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)3]=β1β2β3 x [SCN]^3=9*40*63 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^3=22680 *1.551e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.551e-7 ≈3.519e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)4]= β1β2β3β4 x [SCN]^4=9*40*63*16 *1.551e-4*(0.1)^4=362880 *1.551e-4 *0.0001=362880 *1.551e-8≈5.619e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute each term more accurately.

Wait, [Co(SCN)] =9 * x *0.1 =9*(1.551e-4)*0.1= 1.396e-5 M.

[Co(SCN)2] =9*40 *x*(0.1)^2= 360 *1.551e-4 *0.01=360 *1.551e-6 ≈5.5836e-4.

[Co(SCN)3] =9*40*63 *x*(0.1)^3= 22680 *1.551e-4 *0.001=22680 *1.551e-7 ≈22680 *1.551e-7= approx 3.519e-3.

[Co(SCN)4] =9*40*63*16 *x*(0.1)^4=362880 *1.551e-4 *0.0001=362880 *1.551e-8 ≈5.619e-3.

Now, to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2], which is the blue dithiocyanato complex.

The concentration is 5.5836e-4 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M.

So the fraction is (5.5836e-4) / (1e-2) )=0.055836, or 5.5836%.

Which again is about 5.58%, not matching any options. Hmm.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 16.9%, which is close to the fraction we got earlier when assuming the β's are overall constants.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the β's are used. Let me consider the possibility that each β is for the overall complex, not stepwise.

In that case, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n.

So the denominator D would be sum for n=0 to 4 of β_n [SCN]^n.

So,

term0 =1,

term1=β1 [SCN]=9 *0.1=0.9,

term2=β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=0.4,

term3=β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=0.063,

term4=β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=0.0016.

Sum D=1+0.9=1.9+0.4=2.3+0.063=2.363+0.0016=2.3646.

So,

x= c_total / D =1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.227e-3 M.

Now, [Co(SCN)2] = β2 * x * [SCN]^2=40 *4.227e-3 *0.01=40 *4.227e-5=1.6908e-3 M.

The fraction of [Co(SCN)2] is (1.6908e-3) / (1e-2) )= 0.16908, or 16.908%.

Which matches option D:16.9%.

So, the correct approach is that each β is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

But wait, that contradicts the usual definition where β's are stepwise. So perhaps the problem presents the β's as the overall constants, not stepwise. In that case, the answer is D.

But why does the problem mention the stability constants of the complexes? Because each complex has its own stability constant. So perhaps the way I thought initially is incorrect, and each β is the overall K for that complex.

So the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall constant for that complex, not the stepwise.

So the answer would be 16.9%, option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the concentrations of Co²⁺ and SCN⁻ ([Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M, [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). 

### Key Assumptions and Approach:
1. **Stability Constants**: The problem specifies the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. These constants are interpreted as the **overall stability constants** for each complex, meaning βₙ represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n SCN⁻ ligands.

2. **Species Distribution**: The total cobalt concentration is distributed among the following species:
   - Free Co²⁺ ([Co²⁺]),
   - Monothiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)]⁺),
   - Dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺),
   - Trithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₃]⁻),
   - Tetrathiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₄]²⁻).

3. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each species is given by:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{k=0}^{4} \beta_k [\text{SCN}]^k}
   \]
   where \( \beta_0 = 1 \) (for free Co²⁺).

4. **Calculation of Terms**:
   - \( \text{term}_0 = \beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1 \),
   - \( \text{term}_1 = \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \),
   - \( \text{term}_2 = \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \),
   - \( \text{term}_3 = \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \),
   - \( \text{term}_4 = \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).

   The sum of these terms is:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

5. **Fraction of Dithiocyanato Complex**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]²⁺) is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\text{term}_2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, \text{or} \, 16.9\%.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**, which corresponds to **option D**.

ANSWER: D
