Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψf-bar ψf (y)(υ + X(y)). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, I think the structure is probably L = -λ f ψ_f† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Or maybe it's a Yukawa interaction term, right? Because Yukawa couplings usually look like g ψ† ψ X or something. So the boson X interacts with fermion ψ_f.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So, I need to find which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

First, kinematically allowed means that the energy of the boson must be at least equal to the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Since X is a boson, when it decays, it can produce a pair of fermions, like f and f-bar. So each decay product would have a rest mass, and the sum must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

Wait, but the X is 6 GeV, so the total mass of the two fermions must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because each fermion would have mass m_f, since they are a pair (fermion and antifermion), the total is 2 m_f. So 2 m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So I need to list all the known fermions with masses less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's see, the particles would be quarks and leptons. Let me list their masses:

Leptons:
- Electron (e-): mass ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.777 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV (average around 4.5 maybe)
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV, so way over.

Wait, so the bottom quark's mass is about 4.5 GeV. So 2 m_b would be about 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar, because that would require 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is higher than X's mass.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I remember that the masses I know are for the "current" masses, but sometimes in particle physics, especially for lighter quarks, the constituent mass is higher because of binding energy. But no, the current masses are the ones that matter here.

So for quarks, let's see:

u and d are light, their masses are negligible (~mev level), so 2 m_u is about 6 MeV, way under 6 GeV. So X can decay into uū, dđ, s s̄, c c̄, but not b b̄ or t t̄.

Wait, the strange quark mass is about 100 MeV, so 2 m_s is ~200 MeV, which is much less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into s s̄.

Similarly, the charm quark mass is around 1.2
