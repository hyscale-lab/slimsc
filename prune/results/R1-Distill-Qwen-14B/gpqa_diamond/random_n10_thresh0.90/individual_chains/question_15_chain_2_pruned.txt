Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so that means Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means smaller orbit, right? Because of Kepler's third law.

Both planets have circular orbits. Oh, that's important. Circular orbits mean the probability of transit might be a bit easier to calculate since the distance from the star doesn't vary as much as in elliptical orbits. But I think the main factors are the planet's orbital distance and the star's size.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both have the same radius. That's interesting because more massive stars are usually larger, but here they must have similar sizes. So same radius implies that Planet_1's star is more massive but not larger—maybe a main-sequence star versus a slightly evolved one, as the question mentions Planet_2's host is slightly evolved.

Wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so that's why both stars have the same radii. Planet_1's host is more massive but same size—so perhaps it's a younger star or something else. But maybe that's not too important for the transit probability.

So, the transit probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Or wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_planet + R_star) / a, where a is the orbital distance. But since the planet's radius is much smaller than the star's, R_planet can be neglected. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a).

Wait, no, wait. The probability P of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet << R_star, it's approximately R_star/a. So higher R_star and lower a increases P.

Wait, but wait, actually, the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + (R_planet / R_star)). Since R_planet is much smaller, the term is about R_star/(a). So the probability is proportional to R
