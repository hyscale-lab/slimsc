Okay, so I've got this question here about which planet is more likely to transit, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The setup is that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, are being observed via transit method. The researchers have limited time and want to pick the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both planets were detected using the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both have circular orbits.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. Wait, that's interesting. So even though the stars have different masses, their radii are the same. So Star_1 (Planet_1's star) is more massive but same size as Star_2.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's distance from the observer. The formula for transit probability is something like P = (R_planet / R_star)Â² * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^0.5 )) )... Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again.

Oh wait, I think the basic formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the inversely related to some orbital parameters. Or maybe it's more about the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. Another thought: the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective) is given by P = (R*/a)^2, where R* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's the area ratio for the transit depth. Hmm, maybe I should look up the actual formula.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up things. The transit probability is actually the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it transits the star from our point of view. The formula for this probability is P = R*/a, where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Another approach: the transit probability
