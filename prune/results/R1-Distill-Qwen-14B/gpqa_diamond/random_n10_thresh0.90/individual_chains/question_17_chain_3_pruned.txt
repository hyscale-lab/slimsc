Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, which probably means all the EDTA is in its active form, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and the K is the formation constant, right? The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form the complex.

So the reaction would be: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is very stable.

The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since it's a 1:1 complex, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would affect the final concentrations. But wait, the complex is already formed, so I should probably think about the dissociation of the complex.

The dissociation of the complex would be: CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The K for this dissociation would be the inverse of the formation constant. So Kdissociation = 1/Kf. So Kdissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let's say that 'x' is the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. Then, according to the dissociation equation, the concentration of both Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be 'x'. So the expression for Kdissociation would be:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] / [CaEDTA^2-] = x^2 / (0.02 - x)

Since Kd is very small (2e-11), x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That makes the equation x^2 / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x: x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13. Taking square root, x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13, the square root is 2 * 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-6.5 is same as 1e-6.5. Let me compute that. Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6, 1e-7 is 1e-7. 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, because 10^(-6.5) = 10^0.5 * 10^-7 = approx 3.16 * 1e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Oh wait, but wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * 3.16e-7 = approximately 6.32e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That matches. So the concentration of Ca²+ would be 6.3e-7 M.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps. Kd is 2e-11. The complex concentration is 0.02. So setting up the equation:

x^2 = (2e-11)(0.02) → 4e-13. x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 = 2 * 10^(-6.5) = 2 * (10^0.5 * 10^-7) → 2 * 3.16e-7 = 6.32e-7. Yep, so option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The dissociation constant \( K_{\text{diss}} \) is the inverse of the formation constant \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_{\text{diss}} = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 1
