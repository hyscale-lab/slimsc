Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems, right? It's sort of like a cube that's been compressed or something.

The given parameters are the interatomic distance, which is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, wait, interatomic distance—does that mean the edge length 'a' of the rhombohedral unit cell? Because in a cubic system, the interatomic distance would be the same as the edge length, but rhombohedral has all edges equal but angles different from 90 degrees. Oh wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedron, and all edges are the same length. So 'a' is 10 Angstroms.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor, but I'm a bit foggy on the exact formula. Oh right! The formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is given by the inverse of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. So the formula is d_hkl = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(a^2) - 2(hk cosβ)/(a^2) ... wait, no, maybe that's not the right way. Alternatively, I think for a general rhombohedral crystal, the interplanar distance can be found using the formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, another approach. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where all a, b, c are equal (a = b = c) and all angles are equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So perhaps the formula for d for (hkl) plane in a rhombohedral system can be simplified. 

The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d = (a)/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos gamma) - 2(hl cos beta) - 2(kl cos alpha) )) )

But since in this case, alpha
