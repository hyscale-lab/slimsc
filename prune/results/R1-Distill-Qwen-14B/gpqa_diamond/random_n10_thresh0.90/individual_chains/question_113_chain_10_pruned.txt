Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and think through each piece of information given.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all C6H something O or O2. So I need to match the spectral data to the correct formula.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually suggest O-H groups. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait a second—carboxylic acids have a broad peak because the O-H is acidic and easily dissociates. Alcohols also have O-H stretches, but they can vary in width depending on the alcohol. But the broadness might suggest a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH group in another form.

Then, the FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is a strong indicator of carbonyl groups. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700, which might suggest some conjugation. Like maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl group, or perhaps an aromatic ring like in an aromatic ester or ketone. Oh wait, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group. That would have a lower wavenumber because of conjugation.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, probably in a conjugated system with a carbonyl group. That would fit with the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650—if it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, like a ketone or ester with a double bond adjacent.

Then the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give m/z 45? Let me think. 45 is a common mass. It could be a CH3CO+ ion (which is 43, but wait, maybe another structure. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like (CH3)2CO, but that's 58. Wait, 45. Let's calculate the possible combinations. The molecular formula is one of the options given, so maybe the molecular weight can help. Let me see the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72 +12 +32=116 g/mol.

Option B: C6H10O. (6*12)+(10)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O. 72+12+16=100.

The mass spectrum's m/z 45 could be a fragment. So what's 45? Let's see. 45 could be (CH3)2CO+? No, that's 58. Alternatively, maybe CH2CO something. Or maybe a ketene fragment? Alternatively, perhaps a CH2=CH-O group? Or maybe something else.

Wait, the m/z 45 could be a fragment like CH3-O-CH2- something? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks down. Let's think about the possible molecular formulas and see what fragments could give 45.

Wait, another approach: for the mass spec, the most common fragments come from losing certain groups. For example, if the compound is an ester, it might break into the acid and alcohol parts. Or if it's a ketone, maybe it breaks into smaller pieces.

But perhaps I should look for the molecular formula that includes a carbonyl and a vinyl group, which is suggested by the NMR and IR data.

So let me think about each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: For C6H12O2, the formula is CnH2nOx. Wait, the general formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = (2n +2 - m + x)/2, where n is carbons, m is hydrogens, x is halogens (but here x is O). Wait, actually, the correct formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there are no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2. So for C6H12O2, C=6, H=12.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation. That can be one ring or one double bond or one triple bond.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So DoU could be 1 if it's a double bond, but then maybe another DoU elsewhere. Wait, but the calculation says only one. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl group is considered as a DoU. Wait, yes, a carbonyl is a double bond, so that's one DoU. Then the vinyl group is another double bond, so that would require two DoUs. So for option A, with DoU 1, that's not possible. Because two double bonds would make DoU=2.

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C6H12O2.

The general formula for degrees of unsaturation is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

But for O, it doesn't count into DoU. So for C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So one DoU.

That suggests either one ring and one double bond (if any), but each ring or double bond is a DoU. Wait, no, each ring or double bond is one DoU. So if the molecule has a ring plus a double bond, that's two DoU. Hmm, but with DoU=1, that's not possible. So the molecule must have only one double bond and no rings, or one ring and no double bonds.

But the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So if DoU is 1, then the molecule has one double bond and no rings. So that's possible.

But wait, the IR shows a peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl (C=O), so that's another DoU. So that's two DoUs. But the formula only allows one. So that can't be right. Therefore, option A (C6H12O2) cannot be correct.

Wait, that's a problem. So the presence of a carbonyl (which is a double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond) would require two DoUs, but option A only has one. So that's a contradiction. So option A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two DoUs. So perhaps a ring plus a
