Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the problem gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a boson field X and fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed for X at the lowest order.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the boson and the rest mass of the fermions. For a decay to be possible, the sum of the rest masses of the decay products must be less than the mass of the boson. But wait, wait, because when a boson at rest decays, energy and momentum conservation require that the total energy of the decay products is at least the sum of their rest masses. So the boson's mass has to be greater than twice the fermion mass since each fermion gets half the energy (for a pair like f and f bar, they need to each have m_f).

Wait, no, actually, the condition is that the boson mass must be greater than twice the mass of each fermion. Because when the boson decays into a pair (like a quark and antiquark), each must have energy at least equal to their rest mass. So m_X > 2*m_f.

So, the first thing I need to do is list all the possible fermions that have a mass less than half of 6 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Wait, but particles like electrons, muons, taus? Let me think about their masses. Electrons are about 0.5 MeV, muons around 105 MeV, taus are about 1.78 GeV. So tau is 1.78 GeV. So 2*m_tau is about 3.56 GeV. Oh wait, 6 GeV is the mass of X. So 3 GeV is half of that. So a fermion with mass up to 3 GeV can be produced, because 2*m_f must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, no wait. The condition is that the sum of the two fermions' rest masses must be less than or equal to the boson's mass. But since they are a pair, each has mass m_f, so sum is 2m_f. So 2m_f ≤ m_X. So m_f ≤ m_X /2.

So m_X is 6 GeV, so m_f must be ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let's list them.

Leptons: The electron is way below, the muon is about 0.105 GeV, and tau is about 1.78 GeV. So all leptons except maybe some heavy ones (but the tau is the heaviest, so it's included since 1.78 <3).

Quarks: The up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks. Let's think about their masses. Wait, but the masses are a bit model-dependent. In the Standard Model, the masses are as follows approximately:

Up quark: ~2 MeV
Down quark: ~4-5 MeV
Strange quark: ~95-100 MeV
Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
Top quark: ~173 GeV

Wait, but some sources give different values. For example, the bottom quark is about 4.7 GeV, which is above 3 GeV. So 2*m_f for bottom would be 9.4 GeV, which is way above X's mass of 6 GeV. So bottom quarks can't be decay products because 2*4.7=9.4 >6.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, 2*m_f must be less than or equal to m_X=6 GeV. So m_f has to be ≤3 GeV.

So for quarks, which ones have m_f ≤3 GeV?

Up quark: ~2 MeV yes.

Down: ~5 MeV yes.

Strange: ~100 MeV yes.

Charm: ~1.5 GeV, which is 1.5 <3, so yes.

Bottom: ~4.5 GeV, which is above 3, so no.

Top is way higher, so no.

So the fermions that can be decay products are up, down, strange, charm, and the leptons (electron, muon, tau).

Wait, but wait: the tau is 1.78 GeV, so 2*m_tau is about 3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV. So 2*1.78 ~3.56 GeV. But m_X is 6 GeV, so 3.56 <6, so that's okay. No, wait, I think I got it wrong. The condition is that 2*m_f <= m_X. So for tau, 2*1.78=3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, tau can be produced. So X can decay into tau and anti-tau.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. For a fermion pair (like f and f-bar), the sum of their rest masses must be less than or equal to X's mass. Since each is m_f, the sum is 2m_f. So 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be a decay product. So let's see:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV → yes.

Muon: ~0.105 GeV → yes.

Tau: ~1.78 GeV → yes, because 1.78 <3.

Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV → yes.

Strange quark: ~0.1 GeV → yes.

Up, down quarks: even smaller → yes.

So, the fermions that can be decay products are: u, d, s, c, tau, and the charged leptons e and mu. But wait, in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is given as -λ f f-bar (y)(upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y). Wait, I'm not fully sure about the notation, but perhaps it's more about what particles are allowed in the interaction.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays. So for a boson X to decay into two fermions f and f-bar, the sum of their rest masses must be ≤ m_X.

So, for each possible fermion pair:

Tau pair: 2 * 1.78 = 3.56 GeV <6 → allowed.

Charm pair: 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 → allowed.

Up: negligible, allowed.

Similarly, down, strange, e, mu: all allowed.

But bottom quark (m ~4.5 GeV) → 2*4.5=9 GeV>6 → not allowed.

So the possible decay channels are:

X → tau+ tau-

X → e+ e-

X → mu+ mu-

X → charm c c-bar (or is it c and anti-c? The notation is c c-bar, but in the options, it's written as cbar)

Also, the same for up, down, strange quarks. So all these possibilities are allowed.

Wait, but the options include various combinations. Let me look at the options.

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b would have 2*4.5=9 GeV>6, so it's not allowed. So option A can't be correct because it includes b and s. S is okay, because s quark is about 100 MeV. So 2*0.1=0.2 GeV<<6. So option A includes b which is not allowed. So Option A is wrong.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, that includes c, which is allowed. So this seems correct.

Option C: Includes top quark (t t-bar). No, top is way too heavy (173 GeV), so 2*173 is way more than 6, so impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b-bar, etc. Wait, no, option D lists b-bar, but 2m_b is 9 GeV>6, so it's not allowed. So D includes b, which is wrong.

So the correct option must include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Let's see:

Option B says c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's all allowed.

Wait, but wait. The Lagrangian term is given. Does the interaction term affect which fermions can be decay products? For example, whether the fermions are charged or neutral, or if the coupling is allowed.

Looking at the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ f f-bar (y) (upsilon + X(y)) psi_f(y)

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading it. Let me parse it again. Oh, maybe it's written as -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, that might not make much sense because the structure seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is Yukawa-like, where the coupling is between X and the fermion field.

Wait, perhaps the interaction is written as something like -λ (Yukawa coupling) times X times the fermion fields. For Yukawa coupling, the interaction would be something like g X ψ ψ-bar, which would mediate the decay X→ψ ψ-bar.

So for each fermion ψ, if there's a coupling, then X can decay into ψ and ψ-bar.

So the question is, which fermions are coupled to X?

The given interaction is -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Wait, perhaps the notation is that f is the fermion field. Let me think again. Maybe it's written as L = -λ X f ψ_f, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's more about whether the Lagrangian allows the coupling. If the interaction term is proportional to X times the fermion fields, then any fermion that can couple to X can be a decay product, provided the kinematic conditions are met.

In the Standard Model, for example, the Higgs boson couples to fermions via Yukawa interactions. So, for the Higgs, any fermion with mass can be a decay product if the kinematics allow.

In this problem, the Lagrangian is given as L = -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, perhaps that's a Yukawa interaction term, which would allow X to decay into any fermion pair that it couples to.

Assuming that X couples to all fermions (like the Higgs does), then the possible decay channels are all fermions with 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

So the allowed fermions are up, down, strange, charm, tau, muon, electron.

So the possible decay channels are X → f f-bar for each of these fermions.

Now, looking back at the options.

Option B is X→ c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

That's correct as per the above analysis.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed, so D is wrong.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the quark masses again because I might have gotten some wrong.

Charm quark: about 1.5 GeV. So 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 GeV → allowed.

Bottom quark: about 4.5 GeV → 2*4.5=9 GeV>6 → not allowed.

So, the possible quarks are u, d, s, c.

So decay channels for X would include:

c c-bar,

s s-bar,

u u-bar,

d d-bar.

Plus the leptons:

tau+ tau-,

mu+ mu-,

e+ e-.

So option B lists all these.

So the answer is B.

For a decay to be allowed, the total rest mass of the decay products must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
