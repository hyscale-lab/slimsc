Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars meet the brightness requirements for both instruments.

Let me start by understanding the given information. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16. So any star that is brighter than or equal to 16 mag can be seen by HIRES, and up to 17 for ESPRESSO. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both, so their apparent V magnitudes must be ≤16 (since HIRES is more restrictive).

Now, looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. I need to find its apparent magnitude. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. So d=10 → log10(1)=0. So m = 15.5. So its apparent V is 15.5. That's less than both 16 and 17, so detectable by both.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5 mag, distance 5 pc. Wait, but it's given the apparent magnitude, so I don't need to calculate it. Its apparent mag is 16.5. But ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so it can detect it. HIRES can't, since 16.5 >16. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's out.

Star3: Apparent V mag 15.5. But wait, E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. Oh, so there's interstellar extinction (dust reddening). The formula says the total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction A_v = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the apparent magnitude we observe is actually m_observed = m_true + A_v. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the apparent magnitude is already the observed one, so does that mean the star's intrinsic brightness is dimmer? Or the observed apparent magnitude is m = m_intrinsic + A_v? Or is the given m the observed or the intrinsic?

Wait, the question says for Star3, the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but there's E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, wait, that's confusing. Because E(B-V) is the amount of reddening, which affects the apparent magnitude. So the star's actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude would be less, because extinction makes it appear dimmer. So the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. Since A_v is positive (extinction makes it appear dimmer), m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6. So the question is, what is the intrinsic apparent magnitude? Because the extinction makes the star appear dimmer, so the intrinsic magnitude would be brighter. So m_true = m_observed - A_v. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. Because A_v is the amount by which the star is made fainter. So if a star's true apparent magnitude is m, but because of extinction, it appears m + A_v. So for Star3, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, but the intrinsic apparent mag is 15.5 - A_v.

But wait, the question says Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5, but also E(B-V)=0.6. So perhaps the observed magnitude is 15.5, and the actual (intrinsic) is brighter. So the intrinsic apparent mag is 15.5 minus 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, no, because the extinction makes the star appear fainter, so the observed magnitude is larger. So the true apparent magnitude is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the observed mag is 15.5, which is already the value given. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the apparent V magnitude is 15.5, which includes the extinction. So the star's actual (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. So that's brighter. But wait, for the purpose of detection, the key is the observed apparent magnitude. Because the spectrograph observes the star as it appears through the interstellar medium.

Wait a minute, when using a spectrograph, the apparent magnitude is the observed one, which includes extinction. So the spectrograph's limit is based on the observed magnitude. So for detection, the apparent magnitude (already including extinction) must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES.

So for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5. That's less than 16. So it's detectable by both.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial data says Star3 has apparent V magnitude 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the actual apparent magnitude (including extinction) is 15.5, which is brighter than 16, so both can detect it. So Star3 is detectable by both.

Star4: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent mag is 15.5 (since d=10, same as Star1). But E(B-V)=0.4. So A_v=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. Wait, no. Wait, if the star's absolute magnitude is 15.5, and distance is 10 pc, then m = M + 5 log(d/10) → 15.5 + 0 =15.5. But wait, this is the true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude. But because of extinction, the observed apparent magnitude is 15.5 + 1.24=16.74.

Wait, no. Because the extinction makes the star appear fainter. So the observed m is higher. So Star4's apparent mag is 15.5 (intrinsic) plus 1.24 extinction → m_observed = 16.74. So the observed mag is 16.74. Which is above both 16 and 17? No. Wait, 16.74 is greater than 16, so HIRES can't detect it (needs ≤16). ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, so 16.74 is less than 17, so ESPRESSO can detect it. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Wait, wait. Star4's calculation: M=15.5, d=10 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10) → 15.5 + 5*(0) =15.5. So intrinsic apparent mag is 15.5. Then, extinction adds 1.24, so observed m is 15.5+1.24=16.74. So yes, that's correct. So Star4's apparent mag is 16.74. Since HIRES can only go down to 16, Star4's apparent mag is 16.74, which is larger than 16. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so it can detect Star4. So Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO.

Star5: Absolute V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. So m = M +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5). Log(0.5) is -0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010) is -1.505. So m=16.5 -1.505 =14.995, approximately 15. So apparent mag is about 15. But wait, any extinction? Star5 doesn't mention E(B-V), so I assume it's zero. So apparent mag is 15. So that's less than 16 and 17. So both spectrographs can detect it.

Wait, but wait, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance is 5 pc. So m = 16.5 +5 log(5/10) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505 = 14.995 → ~15. So apparent mag is 15. So that's definitely within both telescopes' limits.

So now, which stars are detectable by both?

Let me list each star's observed apparent magnitude:

Star1: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star3: m=15.5 → detectable by both.

Star4: m=16.74 → detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: m=15 → detectable by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check Star3 and Star5.

Star3: The question says apparent V mag is 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So the observed apparent mag is 15.5, but the star's actual (intrinsic) apparent mag is 15.5 - 1.86 =13.64. But the spectrograph's limitation is based on the observed magnitude. So if the observed V mag is 15.5, which is less than 16, then it's detectable by both.

Wait no, I'm getting confused again. The apparent magnitude given for Star3 is 15.5, but that's before accounting for extinction? Or after? The way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read.

The question says for Star3: apparent V mag of 15.5 and E(B-V)=0.6. Wait, but the note says that the total absorption is 3.1*E(B-V), so A_v=1.86. So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

Wait, so if the star's true (intrinsic) apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic, then the observed would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. So if the observed m is 15.5, then m_intrinsic is 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. But the question says the apparent V mag is 15.5, which is the observed value. So in that case, Star3's observed apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is okay for both spectrographs.

Wait, that's correct. Because when you observe a star, the apparent magnitude you measure includes the extinction. So if Star3's observed m is 15.5, then it's within both limits. Because 15.5 ≤16 and ≤17.

So Star3 is detectable by both.

Star5: No extinction mentioned, so m is 15. Detectable by both.

Wait, but Star5's apparent magnitude is 15, which is definitely within both.

Now, which stars are detectable by both?

Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star3: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15 → yes.

Wait, but let me go back to Star4. Star4's apparent mag is 16.74. So only ESPRESSO can detect it, not HIRES.

So which options have stars detectable by both?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can only be detected by ESPRESSO, so both can't be detected by HIRES. So option A is wrong.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both. So that's a possibility.

Option C: Star2 and Star3 → Star2's m is 16.5, only ESPRESSO can detect. So only Star3 is common to both, but Star2 isn't. So option C is wrong.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star1 is detectable by both, but Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO. So option D is wrong.

Wait, but what about the other stars?

Star1: detectable by both.

Star3: detectable by both.

Star5: detectable by both.

So looking at the options, the only correct pair would be either Star1 and Star3, or Star3 and Star5, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both detectable by both.

Option A: Star4 and 5 → Star4 not detectable by HIRES.

Option D: Star1 and 4 → Star4 no.

So which options are given?

The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So according to this, Star3 and Star5 are both detectable by both spectrographs. So option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck Star5. Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, distance 5 pc: m = 16.5 +5 log(5/10) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 → about 15. So yes, m=15. So within both.

Wait, but wait: Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, which is lower (brighter) than Star1 and 4's 15.5. So it's a dimmer star, but because it's closer (5 pc), it's brighter in apparent magnitude.

So the stars that are detectable by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

So from the options, which pair is correct?

Looking at option B: Star3 and Star5.

Another option, what about Star1 and Star5? But that's not one of the options.

Now, look at the options again.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 is detectable by both. Star4's m is 16.74, which is above HIRES's limit. So Star4 can't be detected by HIRES. So option D is wrong.

Option B is the only one where both stars are within both limits.

Wait, but what about Star3 and Star5.

Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both.

Star5's m is 15, which is within both.

So option B is correct.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., ≤17), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., ≤16). Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Apparent magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), which is ≤16 and ≤17.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 16.5 \).  
   - \( m = 16.5 \) is ≤17 but >16.  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.**

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86
     \]  
   - The observed apparent magnitude already includes extinction, so \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) is ≤16 and ≤17.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 15.5 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(1) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction in V band:  
     \[
     A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24
     \]  
   - Observed apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - \( m_{\text{observed}} = 16.74 \) is >16 but ≤17.  
   - **Detectable only by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.**

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude \( M = 16.5 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   - Apparent magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \) is ≤16 and ≤17.  
   - **Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.**

### Conclusion:
Stars detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are both detectable by both instruments.

**Answer: B**
