Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just add them like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. And for the energies, each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy.

Wait, let me think. The formula for relative velocity between two objects moving at u and v relative to a stationary observer is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). But wait, which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait no, wait. The question asks for the relative speed. So, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or wait, maybe the question is about the relative speed between them when they are moving in opposite directions? Wait, no, both are in the positive x-direction. Oh, right, so it's the same direction.

Wait, no, the problem says they're moving in the positive x-direction, so their velocities are in the same direction. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) which is approximately 0.1428c, so about 0.143c. Looking at the options, option C says 0.14c, option D also 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Now for the total energy of the system. The total energy would be the sum of the energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut's energy is their total relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². But wait, the masses are 2m and 3m.

So for the first astronaut, mass is 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So for the first astronaut, that's gamma * m_astro * c². So m_astro is 2m, so it would be 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Similarly for the second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt
