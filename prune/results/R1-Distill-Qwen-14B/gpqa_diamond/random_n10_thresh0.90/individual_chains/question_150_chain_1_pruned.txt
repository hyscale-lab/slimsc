Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR can be tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. So, for degree of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or double bond. The formula for degrees is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is halogens, but here we don't have any. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plug in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. Five degrees. That could be like a benzene ring (3 double bonds plus some rings, wait no, benzene is three double bonds but it's a six-membered ring, which counts as 4 degrees: 3 double bonds + 1 ring. Wait no, benzene is 3 double bonds as part of a ring, so 3*1 + 1 ring =4 degrees. So if the compound has a benzene ring, that's 4, leaving one more degree for something else, like a double bond or a ring.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H) probably an aldehyde proton. That's a sharp peak, but wait, the integration is 1H. Then 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H)—look like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because two doublets with same coupling, so probably a para-substituted benzene. So maybe two protons each as two doublets. Then 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet? Maybe some adjacent protons, like an enol proton or some sort of conjugated system. 

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is likely a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe a CH2-O or something. Wait, what else could it be? Maybe a CH2 attached to a carbonyl? Or maybe a CH2 connected to something else.

So putting this together, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and some substituents. The 9.72 ppm is the aldehyde, which is downfield, so that's consistent. The two doublets in the aromatic region (6.98 and 6.51) suggest para substitution. So maybe two benzene rings connected somehow? Or perhaps a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons. Benzene is 6 carbons. So the rest would be 2 carbons, plus an O and N. Wait, but it's also 9 hydrogens. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a benzaldehyde group attached to another benzene ring via some chain.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows 9.72 (t,1H) which is aldehyde. So maybe the compound is a diaryl aldehyde. So two benzene rings attached to a butyl group or something with a carbonyl? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's something like 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde with another substituent. Wait, but there's an O in the formula—so maybe an oxygen elsewhere, like a hydroxyl group.

Wait, the NMR data: 6.27 (bs, 2H). Maybe these are protons next to an oxygen, like in a dienol or something. Or perhaps they're adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. 

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): the doublet suggests two protons with same coupling. So maybe a CH2 group attached to something, like O or another group. Maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, but that would be more around 3.3-3.7 ppm, but in this case, it's a d, so maybe adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, putting all together: Perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let me think of a structure.

Wait, the NMR peaks: the aromatic protons are at 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene where each substituent is another group. For example, two phenyl groups attached in para positions? Or maybe a substituent such as a -CH2-CHO group.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a benzalacetophenone analog. For example, something like phenyl benzyl ketone, but that might not fit the formula.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think: Benzene rings would contribute 6 carbons. Then, an aldehyde group (CHO) is another carbon. So that's 7 carbons. Then, perhaps another substituent, maybe a -CH2-O- group, but that might complicate the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like phenyl propargyl aldehyde? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring attached to a CH2CH2CHO group, but that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: the reagents given are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH with heat.

NaNO2 and HCl usually are used for diazotization of an aromatic amine. So the first step is likely converting an amine to a diazonium salt. Then, the second step is H2O—maybe a hydrolysis. The third step is aqueous KOH with heat—could be a condensation reaction or a elimination.

Wait, but wait, the starting compound has an O and an N. Let me think about the structure.

The starting compound's structure: from the NMR, it has an aldehyde (9.72), a para-substit
