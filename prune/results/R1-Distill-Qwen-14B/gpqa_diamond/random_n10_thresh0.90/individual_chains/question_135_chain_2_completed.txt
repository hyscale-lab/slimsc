Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me see what I can remember. The question is about the possible decay products of a boson X, right? The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. And the interaction Lagrangian is provided, but I'm not sure if I'll need that for the kinematic considerations.

Wait, the interaction term is given by L = -λ f ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, I think that's a Yukawa-like interaction. So, this means the boson X is coupling to fermions, and the coupling is proportional to some Yukawa coupling λ. The fermions involved are probably the ψ_f, but the exact type depends on the context.

The main point here is to find out what particles X can decay into. Kinematically allowed decays depend on the mass of X and the masses of the possible decay products. Remember, for a particle to decay into two particles, the combined mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. Let's think about the possible fermion-antifermion pairs. For each pair, I need to consider their rest mass.

Let me list the possible fermions and their masses:

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV. So uū is okay because 2 * 2.2 = 4.4 MeV, way less than 6 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar to up, around 4.7 MeV. So d d̄ is allowed.
- Strange quark (s): about 95 MeV. 2*95 = 190 MeV, which is less than 6 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.5 GeV. 2*1.5 = 3 GeV, less than 6 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV. 2*4.5 = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b b̄ decay is not allowed because 9 GeV >6 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So no.
- Electron (e): mass ~0.0005 GeV. 2*0.0005 is negligible, so allowed.
- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV. 2*0.1=0.2 <6 GeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV. 2*1.77=3.54 GeV <6 GeV. So decay into ττ̄ is allowed.

Wait, what about other particles? Like W or Z bosons? But the problem is about fermionic decay products, right? So the decay products are fermions, like quark-antiquark or lepton-antilepton pairs.

So looking at the quarks, X can decay into uū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄. It cannot decay into b b̄ because 4.5*2=9 GeV>6 GeV.

For the leptons: e+ e-, μ+ μ-, τ+ τ- are all allowed because their combined masses are less than 6 GeV.

Wait, what about other possibilities like mesons? But the Lagrangian seems to suggest that X is coupling directly to fermions, so the decay would be into fermion-antifermion pairs, not hadrons.

So X can decay into any fermion pair where the sum of the masses is less than 6 GeV. So which of the options include these possibilities?

Looking at the options:

Option A: X→b b̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ τ̄, e+ e-. Wait, but b b̄ is 9 GeV, which is not allowed, so option A is incorrect because it includes b b̄.

Option B: X→c c̄, s s̄, uū, d d̄, τ τ̄, μ+ μ-, e+ e-. So c c̄ is allowed, since 3 GeV is less than 6. But does the interaction term allow it? The Lagrangian says λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So ψ_f is a Dirac field, which would be a fermion. Assuming f is the same as ψ_f, so maybe the interaction is with a specific fermion, but the problem states that the interaction is given, so perhaps X can decay into any fermions it interacts with.

Wait, but the problem says "the fermions" are involved, which are perhaps all the possible fermions. So I think the coupling is to all the fermions, so any fermion pair is possible if kinematically allowed.

Thus, for X, the allowed decay products are:

- quarks: u, d, s, c (b is excluded)
- leptons: e, μ, τ.

Now let's check the options again.

Option B: Includes c c̄, s s̄, u u, d d, τ τ, μ μ, e e. So that's correct.

Option C: Includes t t̄ which is 346 GeV (approx 2*173), way above 6 GeV. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: Includes b b̄ and others. Since 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV needed for b, D is incorrect.

Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian provided suggests that \( X \) couples to fermions, and the decay products must be fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the combined rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of \( X \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass of \( X \):** \( X \) has a mass of 6 GeV.
2. **Fermion Masses:**
   - Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( u\bar{u} \) is allowed.
   - Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( d\bar{d} \) is allowed.
   - Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \), so \( s\bar{s} \) is allowed.
   - Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( c\bar{c} \) is allowed.
   - Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( b\bar{b} \) is **not** allowed (since \( 2 \times 4.5 = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( t\bar{t} \) is **not** allowed.
   - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( e^+e^- \) is allowed.
   - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( \mu^+\mu^- \) is allowed.
   - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), so \( \tau^+\tau^- \) is allowed.

3. **Decay Products Allowed for \( X \):**
   - Quark-antiquark pairs: \( u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).
   - Lepton-antilepton pairs: \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^- \).
   - \( b\bar{b} \) and \( t\bar{t} \) are excluded due to their large combined masses.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Incorrect.**
- **Option B:** Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct.**
- **Option C:** Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Incorrect.**
- **Option D:** Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
