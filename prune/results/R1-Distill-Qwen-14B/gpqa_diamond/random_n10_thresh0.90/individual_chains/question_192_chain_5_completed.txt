Okay, so I need to figure out the electric field at a point P outside a spherical conductor with a cavity. Let me try to break this down.

Hmm, the setup: there's a conductor of radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance s from the center of the conductor. So imagine the conductor is a big sphere, and the cavity is a smaller sphere not exactly at the center but shifted a bit. The radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R, so the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

They placed a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. Now, the question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. When a conductor is uncharged and there's a charge inside a cavity, the conductor itself doesn't have any net charge, but there's some redistribution of charges on its inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right. In electrostatics, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. So the inner surface of the conductor would have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q, but wait, in this case, the conductor was initially uncharged. Or wait, wait, no. How does that work again?

Wait, no, the conductor is uncharged. So when you place a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, because the charge inside the cavity (+q) attracts the opposite charge on the inner part of the conductor. Since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance it out.

So the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q.

Now, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the charge enclosed within the Gaussian surface outside. So for a point outside (like point P), the Gaussian surface would enclose the entire conductor, including the outer surface charge.

Wait, but the conductor is a spherical shell. So the outer surface charge will distribute uniformly because the conductor is a sphere. So the field outside should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but what about point P's position relative to the cavity's center? The conductor's center is the center of the big sphere, but the cavity's center is shifted by s. So the charge +q is placed somewhere inside the cavity. Does that affect the electric field outside?

Wait, but in the conductor, the charges rearrange. The inner surface has -q, so the field inside the conductor (the material part) is zero. What about the electric field in the region between the conductor and the cavity? That region is within the conductor, right? No, wait, the conductor is the material, so the cavity is a hollow inside. The region between the conductor and the cavity is the conductor itself, which has zero field inside—so the field in the cavity's interior is due to the charge +q and the induced charges.

Wait, but for a point outside the conductor (like P), the field should depend only on the total charge outside the Gaussian surface. So since the conductor's outer surface has +q, the field outside would be as if that +q were at the center of the conductor. But wait, the conductor's center and the cavity's center are separated by s. So does that affect the field at P?

Wait, no. Because for the Gaussian surface outside, the charges on the outer surface are distributed spherically symmetrically around the conductor's center. So the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q, and the distribution is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the outer field would be as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait. If the cavity's center is offset, then the inner surface charge isn't uniform. Oh, right. Because the inner surface's charge distribution depends on the position of the charge inside the cavity. If the charge is off-center, the inner surface would have a non-uniform distribution, but the outer surface would still be uniform because any external field would have to be due to the outer surface's charge being uniformly distributed.

Wait, but no. The conductor is neutral, and the inner surface has a charge of -q because of the +q inside. The outer surface must then have +q to balance, but the way the outer surface's charge is distributed depends on the geometry. Wait, no, because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution remains uniform regardless of the position of the inner charge. Because any external electric fields are determined by the outer charge, and since the outer surface is a sphere, the charge distributes uniformly, making the field outside depend only on the total outer charge.

Wait, perhaps that's not quite right. Wait, the inner surface's charge is -q, as induced by the +q inside the cavity. The conductor as a whole is neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. But the position of the inner charge affects the distribution on the inner surface. So the inner surface's charge is not uniform; it's more concentrated near the +q. But the outer surface's charge is uniform because the conductor is a sphere and the influence of the inner charge doesn't affect the outer surface's distribution, right?

Wait, actually, no. The outer surface's charge distribution is uniform because the conductor is a sphere. The charges on the outer surface will distribute uniformly regardless of the inner charge's position, because the conductor is a sphere, so any external influences (like the inner charge) don't affect the outer surface's symmetry. So the field outside would be as if all the outer charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

So, the electric field outside the conductor would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/r². Here, the Q_enclosed is the charge on the outer surface, which is +q. The distance from the center of the conductor is L.

Wait, but point P's position relative to the cavity's center is given as l and the angle theta. How does that factor into the calculation?

Wait a second, maybe I'm getting confused. The conductor is a sphere of radius R, so any point outside is at a distance greater than R from the center. The charge inside the cavity is +q, which induces -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer surface. The outer surface's charge is +q, and it's uniformly distributed. So the field outside is the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, so then the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P. So looking at the options, option B is that.

But wait, let me think again. The charge inside the cavity is not at the center, but shifted by s. So the inner surface's charge is -q, but not uniformly distributed. However, the outer surface's charge is still +q, and it's uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. So the outer surface's electric field would be the same as a point charge at the center of the conductor.

So the position of the cavity's center (l, s, theta) doesn't affect the field outside because the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed. So the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the conductor's center.

Wait, but point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity. How does that relate to L, the distance from the conductor's center?

Let me visualize this. The conductor's center is O, the cavity's center is O', separated by s. Point P is at a distance L from O. The distance from O' to P is l. The angle between l and s (the line from O to O') is theta.

So, in the conductor's frame, the field outside is determined by the outer charge, which is +q. So the field at P would depend on the distance from O, which is L. So the field E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is exactly that. The other options involve l and theta, but I don't think those would be factors because the outer field depends only on the outer charge.

Wait, but wait another thought: does the displacement of the cavity's center affect the outer field? Because the inner charge is not at the center, does that affect the outer field? Hmm.

Wait, no. Because the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform regardless of where the inner charge is. Because the conductor is a sphere, the induced charges on the outer surface are uniformly spread. So the outer field is as if the charge is at the center. So the displacement of the inner charge doesn't matter for the outer field.

Therefore, the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So the correct answer would be option B.


To determine the electric field at point \( P \), which is outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor of radius \( R \) is initially uncharged. A small spherical cavity of radius \( r \) is present inside the conductor, with its center separated by a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor. A positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. This induces a charge of \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor (to cancel the field inside the conductor) and a charge of \( +q \) on the outer surface of the conductor (to maintain the conductor's neutrality).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   The electric field outside a charged spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within a Gaussian surface outside the conductor. In this case, the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of \( +q \), distributed uniformly due to the spherical symmetry of the conductor. The displacement of the cavity's center (and hence the non-uniform distribution of the inner surface charge) does not affect the uniform distribution of the outer surface charge.

3. **Field at Point \( P \)**:  
   Point \( P \) is located at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor. Since the outer surface charge \( +q \) is uniformly distributed, the electric field at \( P \) is as if the entire charge \( +q \) were concentrated at the center of the conductor. The field is therefore given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of \( l \) and \( \theta \)**:  
   The distance \( l \) (distance from the center of the cavity to \( P \)) and the angle \( \theta \) (between \( l \) and \( s \)) are not relevant to the calculation of the electric field outside the conductor. The field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor.

5. **Correct Option**:  
   Among the given options, the correct expression for the electric field at \( P \) is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]
