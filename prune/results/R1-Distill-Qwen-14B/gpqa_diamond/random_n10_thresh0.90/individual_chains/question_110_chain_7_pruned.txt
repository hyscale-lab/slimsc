Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can do stars brighter than 16. So the stars need to be brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 for HIRES. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, meaning that apparent magnitude (m) less than 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. Oh wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the apparent magnitude is how bright it looks from Earth. So, if a star is brighter than 17 V mag, that means m < 17, right? Because a magnitude of 1 is brighter than 6, which is brighter than 17. So, for a star to be observable by ESPRESSO, its apparent V magnitude should be less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so m < 16.

So, the stars must have m <17 (so ESPRESSO can see them) and m <16 (HIRES can see them). Wait, wait, no, no—wait. The question says, 'stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed' with ESPRESSO. Oh wait, the way it's phrased is tricky. Because in astronomy, a star that is brighter (lower magnitude) is better. So 'brighter than 17' would mean m <17. So for ESPRESSO, m <17. For HIRES, 'brighter than 16 V mag' means m <16.

So a star has to have m <16 to be detected by both. Because if m is less than 16, then it's also less than 17. So the star must have m <16 to be detected by both. So among the stars given, which ones have m less than 16?

Looking at each star:

Star1: Absolute magnitude, Mv=15.5, distance 10 pc. So apparent magnitude m = Mv + 5 +5 log d (because m = Mv + 5 log (d/10) => Mv +5 +5 log d -5*1 = Mv +5(log d -1) ⇒ wait, no, better to compute it correctly. The formula is m = Mv + 5 log (d) -5, where d is in parsecs. So for Star1, d=10. So m = 15.5 +5*log10(10) -5. log10(10)=1. So 15.5 +5(1) -5 = 15.5 +5-5=15.5. So m=15.5. That's <16. So both can observe.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the question says for Star1, absolute V magnitude is 15.5. So that's the absolute
