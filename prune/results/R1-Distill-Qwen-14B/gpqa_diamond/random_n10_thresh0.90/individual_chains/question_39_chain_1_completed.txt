Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the positions, all the particles were found between x=1 and x=3, nowhere else. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. So the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. But in this case, the particle was only found between 1 and 3, so the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Wait, no, the wave function isn't necessarily zero, but the probability isn't zero outside. But according to the measurements, all particles were found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region because the integral outside should be zero.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. That seems like a complex function. Oh wait, but for the wave function to be physically acceptable, it must be square-integrable and continuous. Also, the boundary conditions might require that the wave function is zero at the ends of the region. Or perhaps it's non-zero only between 1 and 3.

Wait, the problem says "each particle can move along a tube (x-axis direction)" and that "in a part of space where it can exist, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i." But when they measured, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So that part of the wave function must be zero outside this region. So perhaps the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and given this form in between.

But wait, the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So for x <1 or x>3, the wave function is zero. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. That makes sense.

So the first step is to normalize the wave function. The integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must be 1.

Wait, let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the complex conjugate of ψ would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i. Multiplying them together:

[(a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i] * [(a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i] = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i)(0.5i)

Wait, the cross terms (the middle two) would cancel out because one is positive and the other negative. So we're left with (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i * 0.5i). Wait, but 0.5i * 0.5i is (0.25)(i²) which is -0.25.

Wait, so |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) - 0.25.

Wait, that can't be right because the square modulus can't be negative. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Let me re-calculate. The product of ψ and ψ* is [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2 (because (i)(-i) is 1). Oh wait, no. Let me expand it properly.

ψ = A - Bi, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B=0.5.

So ψ* = A + Bi.

So ψψ* = A^2 + ABi - ABi + (Bi)(Bi). Wait, no, more accurately:

(A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A^2 + A Bi - A Bi - (Bi)^2.

Wait, (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + A*Bi + (-Bi)*A + (-Bi)(Bi).

Wait, no: (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + A Bi - A Bi - (Bi)^2. The middle terms cancel out. So it becomes A² - (Bi)^2.

And (Bi)^2 = B² i² = -B².

So ψψ* = A² - (-B²) = A² + B².

So in this case, A is a/sqrt(1+x), B is 0.5.

So ψψ* = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's positive, which makes sense for a probability density, but wait, that would imply that the probability density is a sum of a positive term and another positive term, which could complicate normalization because the integral might diverge.

Wait, but the wave function must be normalized. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

So I need to set up the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral term by term.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So this term becomes a² [ ln(1+x) ] evaluated from 1 to 3.

Which is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

Second term: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) ) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So:

a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. That's a complex wave function. Typically, for a stationary state (which this might not be), the wave function is real. But in this case, it's complex. So perhaps the wave function is a solution to a time-dependent equation, but that's probably not relevant for normalization.

Wait, but the key point is that normalization requires the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 to be 1. And that's what I've computed.

But wait, what about the regions x <1 and x>3? Since the wave function is given as that expression in the part where the particle can exist, but the measurements show that the particles are only found between 1 and 3. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside, but that's already accounted for in the integral being from 1 to 3.

Wait, but the given function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So for x < 1, sqrt(1+x) is still real, but perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3. Hmm, but the problem states that the wave function is given as that expression in a part of space where the particles can exist, but the measurement shows that all are between 1 and 3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside that region. But the problem says that in the part where it can exist, the wave function is given. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But in that case, the normalization would be the same as before.

Wait, but the initial calculation assumes that the wave function is as given only between x=1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. So the integral from 1 to 3 is correct. So the calculation seems right.

Thus, a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To solve the problem, we need to normalize the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The normalization condition requires that the total probability of finding the particle in the region \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) is 1. The probability density is given by the square modulus of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\) into the integral:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\)

   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\). Thus:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_{1}^{3} = a^2 \left(\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right) = a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\)

   The integral of \(0.25\) over \(x\) is:

   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining both terms:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
