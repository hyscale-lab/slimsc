--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, a certain keto acid reacting with X gives a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm. Let's break this down. Starting with the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to release gas W. G is a precipitate. Then heating G gives B. 

First, let's think about gas W. It says W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, protons and neutrons are in the nucleus, but the molecule as a whole. So for the molecule to have equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O? Wait, H2O has H (1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). Wait, the molecule's total protons and neutrons? So for H2O, protons are 2 +8=10. Neutrons are 0 +8=8. No, not equal. Hmm, maybe CO2? Carbon has 6p and 6n (if it's the 12C isotope), O has 8p, 8n. CO2 would have total p:6+16=22, n:6+16=22. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So W is CO2? Or maybe another molecule. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4? Let's see: C is 6p, 6n. H is 1p, 0n. CH4 would have 6+4=10 p, 6+0=6 n. Not equal. Alternatively, maybe it's something like O2? No, O2 has 16p and 16n (each O has 8p,8n). So total p=16, n=16. So O2 fits. Or maybe H2? No, H2 has 2p,0n. No, not equal. 

Wait, the molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So for the entire molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons. So, possible candidates could be:

- CO2: C (6p, 6n), O (8p,8n each). So 6+16=22p, 6+16=22n → 22 each. So yes, CO2 would fit.
- O2: 16p, 16n → same.
- CH4: 6+4=10p, 6+0=6n → nope.
- H2O: 2+8=10p, 0+8=8n → nope.
- N2: 14p, 14n → yes. But N2 is a gas as well.

So W could be CO2, O2, N2, etc. Let's hold that thought.

Now, the reaction between X and Y produces W and G. G precipitates, and when heated, gives B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. What's 277 K in Celsius? 277 - 273 =4°C. So B's melting point is around 4°C. Hmm, which substance has a melting point near there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Wait, no. Wait, water freezes at 0°C, but that's not it. Wait, maybe something like ice melts at 0, but that's not 4. Alternatively, maybe it's a salt. Wait, ammonium nitrate's melting point is about 169°C. Hmm, maybe sodium nitrate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe W is CO2 because when Y is a liquid, perhaps it's water. Wait, X reacts with Y (water) to give CO2? So maybe X is a carbonate?

Wait, but wait a second. Let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, which is a liquid, perhaps Y is water. If X is a carbonate, then reacting with water wouldn't make much sense. Alternatively, could Y be an acid? Or maybe Y is a base?

Alternatively, maybe Y is something else. Let's think about the product gas. If W is CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate. Or if W is H2, then maybe X is an active metal reacting with acid Y. But let's not get stuck here yet.

Moving on: The product of a certain keto acid with X has two oxygen atoms. Keto acid means it's something like acetic acid (CH3COOH), which has two oxygen atoms in the carboxylic group. Wait, but when it reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, maybe X is a base that deprotonates the acid, but that wouldn't add O atoms. Alternatively, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent, adding O.

Wait, the product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 O atoms. Oh wait, the product has 2 O atoms. So maybe the product is something like an ester, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a carboxylic acid anhydride, but that's more O's. Hmm, perhaps X is something like LiAlH4, a strong reducing agent. Then, the keto acid (like a ketone) would react, but I'm not sure. Or maybe X is a metal, and the acid reacts to form a salt. Let's think, if the product has two O atoms, perhaps it's a simple salt, like a metal acetate. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with a metal (like Mg) would form Mg(OAc)2, but that has more O's. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Another angle: X is a reagent used in organic chemistry. Common reagents could be things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7 (for oxidation), or perhaps something like NaOH, KOH for saponification, etc. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard reagent, but that's more of a reactant in synthesis. Or X could be a strong base or acid.

Wait, the question says that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope with a higher mass. So perhaps one of its elements has a common isotope and a heavier one. For example, Cl has Cl-35 and Cl-37, which are both common. Or maybe something like O with O-18.

Wait, the question is about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So I need to figure out what elements are in X.

Let me think about the reaction again. X reacts with liquid Y to produce CO2, perhaps. Another possibility is that W is hydrogen gas, but earlier analysis didn't fit.

Wait, suppose Y is water. Then X could be a carbonate or a bicarbonate. But if X is sodium carbonate, reacting with water wouldn't produce a precipitate, right? Hmm, maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. If Y is an acid, then X could be a carbonate or bicarbonate. For example, sodium carbonate reacting with HCl would produce CO2, water, and NaCl. So in that case, W is CO2, Y is HCl (liquid), X is Na2CO3, and the precipitate G is perhaps something else. Wait, but Na2CO3 and HCl reacting would produce NaCl, H2O, CO2. So precipitate? No precipitate, unless something else is involved.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different liquid, like a hydrocarbon? Unlikely. Maybe Y is an alcohol, but I'm not sure. Let's think about another angle.

The melting point of B is close to 4°C. What compounds have a melting point near there? Maybe ammonium chloride? Wait, ammonium chloride's melting point is around 334 K, which is about 61°C. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe something like sodium nitrate? Doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is ammonium nitrate, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe it's something like ice, but ice's melting point is 0°C. Wait, but 277 K is 4°C, which is near the melting point of ice. So perhaps B is something that's related to ice. Alternatively, maybe B is something like sodium acetate, which has a melting point around 324 K (about 51°C). No, that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe B is a hydrate. Or perhaps it's ammonium nitrate, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another angle: when G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into B and CO2. But wait, then B would be something else. Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide that, upon heating, releases water and another oxide. For example, if G is copper hydroxide, heating it would give copper oxide and water. But then B would be copper oxide, which has a high melting point, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe G is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) when heated decomposes into sodium carbonate, CO2, and H2O. So if B is sodium carbonate, its melting point would be higher. Or maybe B is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it releases CO2 and becomes a metal oxide. For example, CaCO3 upon heating would produce CaO and CO2. Then B would be CaO, which has a high melting point (~2800°C?), which is way higher than 4°C. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe G is something else. Let me think again. The reaction of X with Y is violent, produces gas W, precipitate G. Suppose Y is an acid, X is a carbonate. Then reaction would produce CO2 and a metal salt. For example, if X is sodium carbonate and Y is HCl, they react to give NaCl, H2O, and CO2 gas. But that wouldn't produce a precipitate. Unless X is a metal bicarbonate, like potassium bicarbonate, which when reacted with an acid would produce CO2 and water, but precipitate? Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. If Y is a strong base, like NaOH, and X is an acid, then perhaps a neutralization reaction. But that would produce water and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, if X is H2SO4 and Y is NaOH, they react to form Na2SO4 and water. But Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Alternatively, if X is H3PO4 and Y is AgNO3, they could form a precipitate like Ag3PO4. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to produce a precipitate. For example, if Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is NaCl. Then X + Y would give AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. But the gas W would be nothing in this case. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, Y is an acid. For example, Mg reacting with HCl. They react violently, produce H2 gas, and form MgCl2 solution. But no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacts with water to produce NH3 gas and Mg(OH)2 precipitate. Then, when G (Mg(OH)2) is heated, it decomposes into MgO and H2O. But then B is MgO, which has a very high melting point, not 4°C.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach it systematically.

Let's list possible substances X based on the info:

1. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analogs are used. Common reagents include things like KMnO4, K2Cr2O7 (oxidizing agents), LiAlH4 (reducing agent), NaOH, H2SO4, etc.

2. X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, perhaps one of its elements has a common light isotope and a heavier one. Like Cl (35Cl and 37Cl) or O (16O and 18O).

3. The product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. Keto acid is something like CH3COOH. If X is a base, perhaps it deprotonates the acid to form its conjugate base. But that doesn't add oxygen. Alternatively, if X is a reducing agent, it might reduce the acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the product has two O atoms. So maybe the product is something like an ester or an ether, but that's not directly obvious.

Wait, another possibility: when a keto acid reacts with X, maybe it forms a diatomic molecule with two O atoms. But that doesn't directly make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a carbonate or bicarbonate. For example, if X is a carbonate, and the keto acid is, say, H2CO3 (carbonic acid), but that's not a keto acid. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Let me think about the melting point of B. 277 K is about 4°C. So what's a compound that melts around that temperature? Maybe ammonium nitrate? Wait, ammonium nitrate's melting point is about 169°C. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe something like sodium acetate? No, sodium acetate's melting point is around 324 K (51°C). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's something like potassium nitrate, which has a high melting point. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate has a lower melting point, but I'm not sure about the exact value.

Wait, another angle: when G is heated, it releases B. Let's say G is a hydrate. When heated, it loses water and becomes an anhydrous form. For instance, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) upon heating loses water and becomes Na2CO3. But I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate and upon heating, it decomposes into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate, which upon heating decomposes into a carbonate, CO2, and H2O. For example, 2 NaHCO3 → Na2CO3 + CO2 + H2O. So B would be Na2CO3, which has a melting point of around 842°C. Doesn't fit.

Wait, what about ammonium chloride? If G is ammonium chloride, heating it would decompose into NH3 and HCl gas, but I don't think that's the case here. Alternatively, maybe G is a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide, and upon heating, it loses water. For example, copper(II) hydroxide → copper(II) oxide and water. But then B would be CuO, which has a high melting point.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's try to think about the possible elements in X.

Looking at the options: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 25, 29, 31, 35.

Wait, those numbers are the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

So if X has, say, sodium (23) and chlorine (35.5), but wait, option C is 31, which is close to 23 + 8 (O) =31. So maybe X contains O and Na? Or another combination.

Wait, 25 could be something like C (12) and O (16), but 12 +13=25? No, 12+13=25 is 25, but that's not an element. Wait, 25 could be Mg (24.3) and O (16), but that's 40. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, the options are 35,25,31,29. Let me think of possible pairs:

Option A: 35. Maybe 16 (O) +19 (F)=35? No, but F isn't a likely candidate. Or 12 (C) +23 (Na)=35. So C and Na. But what compound would that be?

Option B:25. Maybe 13 (Al) +12 (C)=25, but that's Al and C. Not a common combination. Or 16 (O) +9 (F)=25. Not likely.

Option C:31. Let's see: Oxygen is 16, so 16 +15 =31. 15 is the atomic weight of phosphorus. So O and P? Not a common combination. Alternatively, 12 (C) +19 (F)=31. Hmm, possible but not common. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl)=31. So N and Cl. Could X be something like NH4Cl? Well, but NH4Cl has N and Cl, so the lightest element would be H (1) and the heaviest Cl (35.5). So sum would be 1 +35.5=36.5, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X has Na (23) and O (16). 23 +16=39. Not in the options. Wait, option C is 31. Let me think of another combination. Maybe C (12) and S (32), sum 44. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the elements are O (16) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 51.5. Not an option.

Another approach: think about the possible elements based on the reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, which has Na (23) and O (16), so sum 39. Not matching any options. Or KOH, K is 39, O 16, sum 55. Not matching.

Another reagent is KMnO4. It has K (39), Mn (55), O (16). So the lightest element is O (16) and the heaviest is Mn (55). Sum 16 +55=71, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps X is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3: elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). Lightest is C at 12, heaviest O at 16. Sum 28, but that's not an option. Alternatively, K2CO3: K (39), C (12), O (16). Sum 12 +39=51, not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. Elements are Na (23), H (1), C (12), O (16). So lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, X could be a nitride. For example, Mg3N2: Mg (24.3), N (14). Sum 24.3 +14=38.3, not an option.

Wait, another thought: what if X is a metal with a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has 35Cl and 37Cl. So if X is Cl2, but Cl2 is a diatomic gas. However, in the reaction, perhaps X is part of a compound. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a chlorinated compound. Let's say it's NaCl. Then the elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). So lightest is Na (23), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 23 +35.5=58.5, which isn't an option.

Wait, but wait. The problem says to sum all the heavier and lighter isotopes for each element present. So if X has multiple instances of an element, sum all their isotopes.

Wait, no, the question says: "if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed." So for each element in X, regardless of how many atoms, we take all their isotopes. Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Or perhaps it's considering the sum of the lightest and heaviest isotopes for each element. 

Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X." Hmm, perhaps each element in X contributes its lightest and heaviest isotopes, and we sum those for all elements.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another angle. Let's think about possible X and the reaction.

If X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), reacting with HCl (Y is HCl), the reaction is:

Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O.

So gas W is CO2, which fits (since CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons as earlier thought). The precipitate G would be nothing, since NaCl is soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is NaCl. Then, the reaction would produce AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. So W would be nothing, which doesn't fit because W is a gas. So that's not right.

Another possibility: X is a carbonate, and Y is a weak acid like acetic acid. The reaction would produce CO2, but no precipitate? Or maybe if X is a metal carbonate and Y is a strong acid, perhaps producing a precipitate of another salt. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is an alcohol, and X is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the product when a keto acid reacts with X. The product has two oxygen atoms. Let's say the keto acid is something like acetic acid (CH3COOH). If X is a base, like NaOH, then the reaction would be neutralization, producing sodium acetate (CH3COONa), water, and perhaps gas? But sodium acetate has two O's in the acetate ion. Wait, the product would have more O's, but the question says it contains two atoms of oxygen. So maybe the product is something else.

Wait, perhaps the product is a molecule with two O atoms, like O2. But that doesn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, maybe X is a reducing agent, like LiAlH4. When it reacts with a keto acid (like a ketone), it would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But in that case, the product would have more O's. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is P2O5, which can cause dehydration of a keto acid. But I'm not sure about the product in that case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not certain.

This is getting quite complex. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 31, which could be the sum of O (16) and P (31). But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, O (16) and S (32) would sum to 48. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is a compound containing H and O. For example, H2O. But H2O doesn't fit with the reagent aspect. Or perhaps X is something like H2SO4, which is a common reagent. Then, the elements are H, S, O. The lightest element is H (1), the heaviest O (16). Sum is 17, which is not an option.

Alternatively, X could be something like KMnO4, which has K (39), Mn (55), O (16). Sum of lightest (O,16) and heaviest (Mn,55) is 71, not an option.

Another approach: perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, NaOH. Then, elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17, not an option.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the initial reaction again.

X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W (same # of protons and neutrons), precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (4°C). 

Let me assume W is CO2. So X is a carbonate. Then Y could be a strong acid like H2SO4. The reaction would produce CO2, water, and the corresponding sulfate. If X is CaCO3, and Y is H2SO4, then the reaction is:

CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O.

In this case, G would be CaSO4. Is CaSO4 soluble? I think CaSO4 is sparingly soluble, so it could form a precipitate. Then, heating CaSO4 might not release anything, but perhaps it's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps G is something else.

Wait, but when CaSO4 is heated, it doesn't decompose at normal temperatures. So perhaps this isn't the right track.

Another thought: perhaps G is a carbonate hydroxide, which upon heating loses CO2 and becomes an oxide. For example, sodium carbonate hydroxide (2Na2CO3·H2O) upon heating would lose H2O and CO2 to form 2NaO.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe G is a basic carbonate, like CuCO3·Cu(OH)2. Heating that would produce CuO and CO2. But then B would be CuO, which has a high melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. For example, NaHCO3. Heating it would produce Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Na2CO3, which has a melting point higher than 4°C.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is a solution of a salt, and X is a metal. For example, X is Zn, Y is a solution of AgNO3. Reaction would produce Zn(NO3)2 and Ag. But in that case, W would be nothing. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide, and X is an acid, producing H2S gas. But H2S has 2p and 2n per molecule: 2(1p +16n) → total p=18, n=18. So that fits W. So W could be H2S. Then, X could be H2SO4 reacting with a sulfide like FeS. The reaction would produce FeSO4, H2S gas, and so on. But then Y would be FeS, which is a solid, not a liquid. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a liquid such as CS2 (carbon disulfide), and X is a metal. But I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O2 gas, which has 16p and 16n. So O2 fits. Then, the reaction of X with Y produces O2. So X could be a metal reacting with an acid to produce hydrogen gas, but that doesn't give O2. Alternatively, maybe X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, reacting with water to produce O2.

Ah! That's a possibility. Let's explore this.

If X is Na2O2 (sodium peroxide), which is a reagent used in organic chemistry, especially for oxidation reactions. It reacts with water (Y) to produce O2 gas (W), NaOH, and possibly some other products.

Wait, the reaction of Na2O2 with water is:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

So W is O2, which fits the condition (same number of protons and neutrons, 16 each). The precipitate G would be NaOH, but NaOH is soluble in water. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps Y is not water.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid, like H2SO4. The reaction of Na2O2 with H2SO4 (liquid) would produce O2 gas, sodium sulfate, and water. So:

Na2O2 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + H2O2 + O2↑.

Wait, that's a possible reaction. But in that case, perhaps H2O2 is formed, which is a liquid. So the precipitate G would be Na2SO4, which is soluble. Hmm, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else. Maybe Y is ethanol. Then, Na2O2 could react with ethanol to produce O2. But I'm not sure about the precipitate.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track with X being a peroxide. Let me think about another angle.

The product of a keto acid with X has two O atoms. If X is NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetic acid, the product would be sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+), which has two O's in the acetate group. Wait, but the sodium acetate molecule has more than two O's. Wait, the acetate ion is CH3COO-, which has two O's in the carboxylate group, but the molecule as a whole has more. Hmm, but the product might refer to the anion. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps when X is a base and reacts with the keto acid, it forms a salt with two O's. Not sure.

Another approach: The cumulative atomic masses of lightest and heaviest elements in X. Let's think of possible X with elements whose atomic masses sum to one of the options.

Option C is 31. Let's think of elements that sum to 31.

16 (O) + 15 (P) → 31.

So X could contain O and P.

Or, 12 (C) + 19 (F) → 31. But F isn't common in many reagents.

Alternatively, 14 (N) + 17 (Cl) → 31. So N and Cl.

Wait, N and Cl. What compounds have both N and Cl? Like NH4Cl (ammonium chloride). Let me check the properties.

NH4Cl is a reagent used in organic chemistry, such as in the formation of amides or in some substitution reactions.

When NH4Cl reacts with a strong base like NaOH, it can produce NH3 gas. So in this scenario, perhaps Y is NaOH (liquid), X is NH4Cl. The reaction would be:

NH4Cl + NaOH → NaCl + NH3↑ + H2O.

So W is NH3, which has 14 (N) p and 14 (14 from N and 3*1 from H's) n? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule as a whole: NH3 has 14 (1 N, 3 H) protons and 14 (14 from N, 3 from H) neutrons? No, wait. Hmm, NH3 has 14 protons (1 from N, 3 from H), but wait, wait. Each H has 1 proton, so 1 +3 =4 protons. Each H has 0 neutrons. N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (if it's ^14N). So NH3 has 1 N (7p,7n) and 3 H (1p,0n each). So total p:7+3=10. Total n:7+0=7. That's not equal. So W would not be NH3.

But the problem states that W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps W is CO2 again.

Wait, if X is a carbonate, like CaCO3, and Y is HCl, then reaction is:

CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O.

So W is CO2. Then, if X is CaCO3, what's the product when it reacts with a keto acid?

Wait, CaCO3 is not a reagent in organic chemistry. More commonly, CaCO3 is used in the lab for other purposes, like in decarboxylation reactions.

But the question says X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. So perhaps X is something else. Maybe X is a metal carbonate, like MgCO3. MgCO3 is used in some organic reactions, perhaps. When MgCO3 reacts with an acid, it produces CO2, water, and the corresponding salt.

So, let's say X is MgCO3. Reacting with Y (HCl) gives:

MgCO3 + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O.

So W is CO2, which fits.

Now, the precipitate G would be MgCl2, which is soluble. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps Y is not HCl.

Alternatively, Y could be a different acid, like H2SO4. MgCO3 + H2SO4 → MgSO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. MgSO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is MgCO3. Then, the reaction would be MgCO3 + 2 AgNO3 → Mg(NO3)2 + Ag2CO3↓ + CO2↑. Wait, but Ag2CO3 is not a common compound; silver salts are often insoluble. Alternatively, perhaps it forms Ag2CO3, which would precipitate. But I'm not sure about the reaction details.

Assuming G is Ag2CO3, which upon heating would decompose into Ag2O and CO2. Then B would be Ag2O. What's the melting point of Ag2O? I think it's around 1,170°C, which doesn't fit the 4°C melting point of B.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfide. Let's say X is FeS, Y is HCl. Reaction produces FeCl2, H2S gas, and perhaps a precipitate. But H2S has 2p and 2n per molecule. H2S's molecule has 2 H (1p each, 0n) and 1 S (16p,16n). So total p:2 +16=18. Total n: 0 +16=16. Not equal. So W wouldn't fit.

This is getting really complicated. Let me try to think of the possible elements in X.

The options for the sum are 25,29,31,35.

Looking for two elements whose atomic masses add up to one of these.

Looking at element pairs:

- O (16) and F (19): sum 35. Option A is 35.

Wait, 16 +19=35. So X could have O and F. But what compound has both O and F? Not a common one, but maybe in some fluorinated compounds. Alternatively, maybe X is a compound of O and Cl: 16 +35.5=51.5. Not matching.

Another pair: C (12) and S (32): sum 44. Not matching.

Wait, another pair: N (14) and Cl (35.5): sum 49.5. Not matching.

Hmm, another pair: Cl (35.5) and O (16): sum 51.5. No option.

Wait, another pair: O (16) and S (32): 48. No.

Wait, what about F (19) and O (16): 35. So sum is 35. So if X has F and O, their sum would be 35. So option A is 35.

But what reagent in organic chemistry contains F and O? Maybe something like TFA (trifluoroacetic acid), but that's an acid. Or perhaps something like Freon, but that's a refrigerant, not a reagent in organic chemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a fluorinated carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydrofluoric acid derivative, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another pair: C (12) and O (16): sum 28. Not an option.

Wait, another pair: N (14) and O (16): sum 30. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X contains H and O. If X is H2O, sum is H (1) + O (16) =17, not an option. But if X is something like H2O2, then H (2) and O (32): sum 34, which is close to option C (31), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps X has multiple elements, like Na (23), Cl (35.5), and O (16). The lightest would be O (16), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 51.5, which is not an option.

Another approach: think about which of the options could correspond to the sum of common elements in a reagent.

Option C is 31. Let me think: 16 (O) +15 (P)=31. So if X contains O and P, their sum would be 31.

Phosphorus is in compounds like H3PO4 (phosphoric acid), which is a common reagent in organic chemistry. So if X is H3PO4, the elements are H, P, O. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, which is not an option. But perhaps X is something else with O and P.

Alternatively, X could be a phosphate salt, like Na3PO4. Then the elements are Na (23), P (31), O (16). The lightest element is O (16), heaviest Na (23). Sum 39, which is not an option.

Hmm, not matching.

Another option: C and O. C is 12, O is 16. Sum 28. Not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the elements are Cl and something else. Cl is 35.5, but that's not an option unless paired with something.

Wait, option D is 29. Let's see: 14 (N) +15 (P)=29. So N and P. Are there reagents in organic chemistry that have both N and P? Maybe some organophosphorus compounds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, another pair: 12 (C) +17 (Cl)=29. So C and Cl. Possible compounds include chloroform (CHCl3) and others. Are any of these used as reagents?

Chloroform is used as a solvent, not exactly a reagent in reactions. Alternatively, carbon tetrachloride is a solvent. But I'm not sure if they're considered reagents.

Wait, another reagent is CH2Cl2 (dichloromethane), which is a solvent. Not a reagent per se.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like Cl2, which is a reagent in organic chemistry, but Cl2 is diatomic. Then, the elements are Cl. But the question says X has multiple elements, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps X is a halogen, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: What if X is a carbonate of a light metal, like Na2CO3. Then, the elements are Na (23), C (12), O (16). The lightest is C (12), the heaviest O (16). Sum 28, not matching. So no.

Alternatively, if X is a bicarbonate, like NaHCO3. Then, elements are Na (23), H (1), C (12), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. Not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider the options and see which one makes the most sense.

The options are 25,29,31,35.

If I consider option C: 31. Which could be O (16) + P (15). So if X contains O and P, their sum is 31.

A reagent that contains O and P could be phosphoric acid (H3PO4), which is used in organic chemistry. So in X, the elements would be H, P, O. The lightest element is H (1), heaviest O (16). Wait, but that sums to 17, not 31. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another compound: HPO3 (metaphosphoric acid), but that's not a common reagent.

Wait, perhaps X is something like PCl5. That's a reagent used in organic chemistry, especially for phosphorylation reactions. PCl5 has P (31) and Cl (35.5). The lightest element is Cl? No, Cl is heavier. Wait, lightest is P (31) and Cl (35.5). Sum 66.5, not an option.

Alternatively, X could be a phosphate ester, but that's getting too complex.

Wait, another approach: if the sum is 31, perhaps the elements are N (14) and S (32). But 14 +32=46, not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements having atomic masses that sum to 31 when considering their isotopes.

But the question specifies the lightest and heaviest elements, considering all their isotopes. Oh wait, perhaps for each element present in X, we take all their isotopes (lightest and heaviest) and sum all those.

Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

Wait, perhaps it's the sum for each element of the lightest and heaviest isotopes, and then sum all elements.

Wait, not sure. Maybe for each element in X, we take the lightest and heaviest isotopes, sum their masses, and then sum across all elements.

For example, if X has Cl (which has 35Cl and 37Cl), and O (16O, 17O, 18O), then for Cl, sum 35 +37 =72. For O, sum 16 +18=34. Total sum would be 72 +34=106. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps it's only the lightest and heaviest elements in X, regardless of their isotopes.

Wait, the question says: "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X."

Ah, perhaps it's taking the lightest element (by atomic number) and the heaviest element (by atomic number) in X, and summing their atomic masses.

For example, if X has C and O, then lightest is C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum 28. Not an option.

If X has Na and Cl, sum 23 +35.5=58.5. Not an option.

If X has O and Cl, sum 16 +35.5=51.5. Not an option.

If X has F (19) and O (16), sum 35, which is option A.

So perhaps X has F and O as its elements.

What reagent in organic chemistry contains F and O? Perhaps something like TFA (trifluoroacetic acid), which is CF3COOH. It contains C, F, O. Wait, but then the lightest element would be C (12), heaviest F (19). Sum 31, which is option C.

Ah! So if X is trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), which is CF3COOH. The elements present are C, F, O, and H. The lightest element is H (1), but wait, no. Wait, the elements in X are C, F, O, H. The lightest element by atomic number is H (1), then C (6), F (9), O (8). Wait, H is the lightest, O is heavier than F? No, F has a lower atomic number than O. So the elements in X would be H (1), C (12), F (19), O (16). The heaviest element is F (19), and the lightest is H (1). But that would sum to 20, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's the sum of the lightest and heaviest atomic masses of the elements present, not considering their isotopes.

Wait, perhaps X is something like ClO2 (chlorine dioxide), which is used as an oxidizing agent in organic chemistry. It has Cl (35.5) and O (16). Lightest element is O (16), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 51.5, which isn't an option.

Another possibility: X is KMnO4. Elements are K (39), Mn (55), O (16). Lightest is O (16), heaviest Mn (55). Sum 71, not an option.

Alternatively, X is Na2O. Lightest element O (16), heaviest Na (23). Sum 39. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is something like H2O2. Elements are H (1) and O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

Alternatively, X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). Elements are C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

Alternatively, X is CCl4. Elements are C (12) and Cl (35.5). Lightest C (12), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 47.5, not an option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of which option is more likely based on the information given.

The reaction produces a precipitate, which upon heating gives B with a melting point of 4°C. So B is something that melts around that temperature.

Wait, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point around 270 K (about -3°C), which is close to 277 K (4°C). So perhaps B is sodium bicarbonate.

Wait, no, NaHCO3's melting point is actually around 270 K (-3°C), which is close to 277 K. So if B is NaHCO3, then heating G gives NaHCO3. But how?

If G is something that upon heating produces NaHCO3, perhaps G is a different bicarbonate. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O), which upon heating loses water and becomes anhydrous Na2CO3, but that's not matching the melting point.

Wait, another angle: if B is ammonium chloride, which has a melting point around 337 K (64°C). No, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something like ice, which melts at 0°C. 277 K is 4°C, which is just above 0. So perhaps B is ice, but that's not a compound.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a hydrate that melts at 4°C.

Wait, maybe G is a hydrate of sodium carbonate. Heating it would remove the water and produce anhydrous sodium carbonate, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a different compound. Let me think.

If G is NaHCO3·2H2O, heating it would lose water and become NaHCO3. So B is NaHCO3, which has a melting point around 270 K. That fits.

So if B is NaHCO3, then G is its dihydrate. Then, what is X?

If the reaction produces G (NaHCO3·2H2O), perhaps X is NaCl and Y is something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl and reacts with something to form NaHCO3.

Wait, the Solvay process produces NaHCO3 from NaCl, NH3, CO2, and H2O. But that's an industrial process.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH4Cl, and Y is NaOH. The reaction would produce NaCl, NH3, and H2O. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl, and Y is CO2. Then, in the presence of water, NaCl + CO2 + H2O → NaHCO3. So then, X is NaCl, Y is CO2 (gas?), but Y is liquid. Hmm, not sure.

But this line of thinking is getting too speculative. Let me try to tie it back to the initial question.

Assuming that X is something like NaCl, which is a reagent. The reaction with Y (perhaps CO2 in water) produces NaHCO3 as precipitate G. Then, heating G gives NaHCO3, which is B. But I'm not confident.

In any case, the sum of elements in X (NaCl) would be Na (23) and Cl (35.5). So sum 58.5, not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like MgSO4, which is a reagent. The elements are Mg (24.3), S (32.07), O (16). Lightest is O (16), heaviest S (32.07). Sum 48.07, not an option.

Alternatively, X could be something like Na2SO4. Elements are Na (23), S (32), O (16). Sum of lightest and heaviest: Na (23) + S (32) =55, not an option.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is something like H2O, which is a reagent. But H2O's elements are H and O. Sum is 1 +16=17, not an option.

Alternatively, X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), which is a common reagent. Its elements are C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17, not an option.

I'm really not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

The most plausible scenario seems to be that X contains O and F, summing to 16 +19=35 (option A). But I'm not certain. Alternatively, X could have elements summing to 31 (option C), perhaps O (16) and P (15), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of X and a keto acid has two O atoms. If X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, the product would have more O atoms. Alternatively, perhaps X is a oxidizing agent that oxidizes the keto acid.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone with two O atoms, but that doesn't make sense because a ketone has a carbonyl group (one O). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like an ester, which has two O's. For example, acetic anhydride has two O's in the ester group. But I'm not sure.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the options, I'll go with option C) 31.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, given its role as a reagent in organic chemistry and its reaction with liquid Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and compound B. The melting point of B is approximately 277 K (4°C), and the product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons), O₂ (16 protons, 16 neutrons), or N₂ (14 protons, 14 neutrons). CO₂ is a strong candidate due to its role in reactions involving carbonates or acids.

2. **Precipitate G and Compound B**: G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B's melting point near 4°C suggests it could be sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃), which has a melting point of approximately 270 K (-3°C). This aligns with the given data.

3. **Reaction of X with a Keto Acid**: The product contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X may be a reagent that interacts with the keto acid to form a compound with a specific oxygen count, such as a salt or ester.

4. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must sum to one of the given options (25, 29, 31, 35). 
   - **Option A (35)**: Could correspond to oxygen (16) and fluorine (19). However, fluorine-containing reagents like TFA are not typical for this context.
   - **Option B (25)**: Possible combinations include aluminum (27) and carbon (12), but these do not align with common reagents.
   - **Option C (31)**: Could correspond to oxygen (16) and phosphorus (15). Phosphorus-containing reagents like H₃PO₄ are plausible, but their atomic mass sum does not match the option directly.
   - **Option D (29)**: Possible combinations include nitrogen (14) and sulfur (15), but these do not align with typical reagents.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most plausible scenario is that X contains elements whose atomic masses sum to 31. This aligns with the idea of oxygen (16) and phosphorus (15), even though the exact identity of X remains unclear. The reasoning favors **Option C (31)** as the best match.

ANSWER: C
