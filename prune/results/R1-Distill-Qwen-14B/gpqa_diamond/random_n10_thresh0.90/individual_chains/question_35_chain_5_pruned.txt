Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y (denoted as Ay). The matrix representation of Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, so S looks like:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

I remember that for angular momentum operators, the components are often represented by Pauli matrices or something similar. Let me recall. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is actually the same as what S is here. Because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be σy.

So Ay = c * σy, where c is h/(4π). 

The problem asks me to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, I have to choose the correct statement among the options A to D.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. 

So let's write out the matrix Ay. Since σy is 2x2, Ay is:

Ay = c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So substitute c = h/(4π), so

Ay = [[0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

Wait, that's the matrix. To find eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (Ay - λ I) which is:

| -λ      -i c        |
| i c      -λ        |

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i c)(i c) = λ² - (i c)(i c). 

Wait, wait. Let me compute (i c)(i c). i squared is -1. So (i c)(i c) = (i)^2 c^2 = (-1) c^2. 

So the determinant equation becomes λ² - ( (-1) c^2 ) = 0 → λ² + c² = 0. 

Wait, no. No, wait: the determinant is (Ay - λ I) which is [[ -λ + 0, -i c ], [i c, -λ +0 ]]. So the determinant is (-λ)^2 - (i c)(i c) = λ² - (i c)(i c). 

Wait, (i c) * (i c) = i² c² = (-1)c². So the determinant is λ² - (-c^2) → λ² + c² = 0. So λ² = -c². Therefore, λ = ±i c.

Wait, but the eigenvalues are imaginary? That seems a bit odd, but I think that's correct because the operator is purely imaginary, perhaps.

Wait, let me compute that again. The determinant is λ^2 - [ (i c)(i c) ]. 

(i c) * (i c) = (i)^2 * c^2 = (-1) c^2. So the determinant equation is λ² - (-c²) = λ² + c² = 0 → λ² = -c² → λ = ±i c.

So the eigenvalues are ± i c. Since c = h/(4π), substituting:

λ = ± i (h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, options A and B are about real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues. Let's see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, our eigenvalues are purely imaginary, right? Because λ is i c and -i c. So the imaginary part is ±c, and the real part is 0.

So looking at the options:

Option A: The imaginary parts are ±2πh? Wait, c is h/(4π). So ±i c would have imaginary parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, but option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh. That can't be right because c is h/(4π), so the imaginary part would be ±h/(4π). So option A's imaginary parts are way off.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. But wait, in our case, eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so real parts would be zero. So option B's real parts are 1 or -1, which doesn't match. Also, the imaginary parts would be ±(h/(4π)), not 1/2 unless h is set to a particular value, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Hmm
