--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Hmm. Let's break down each piece of data and see what they can tell us.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. A very broad one might be from an alcohol (like -OH) or maybe an amide, but since there's no mention of NMR peaks that would suggest amines, I'll think O-H. 

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe conjugated, or perhaps an aromatic ring or something else. Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or a ketone with conjugation, or maybe an aromatic ring (like C=C). Alternatively, maybe it's an amide I band, but again, without more data on NMR, I'm not sure.

Moving to the 1H NMR. There are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably an alkene. Also, the presence of a double bond can influence the IR peaks. If there's a conjugated double bond, like in a carbonyl, that might explain the lower wavenumber for the carbonyl.

Now the Mass Spectrometry data: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let me think. Common fragments: For example, the tropylium ion is 91, but that's not 45. The CH2CH2O group—wait, 45 is the molecular weight for something like (CH3)2O, which is 45. But wait, 45 can also be C3H7O? Let me calculate: C3H8O is 3*12 +8 +16=36+8+16=60? No, that's 60. Wait, 45. Let me think: maybe C2H5O+? No, C2H5O is 46 (15+2*12 +5= 15+24+5=44; wait, no, O is 16, so C2H5O is 2*12 +5*1 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh, so CH2CH2O would be (CH2CH2O+) would have m/z 45. Alternatively, another possibility is an aldehyde fragment or something else.

Wait, another thought: The molecular formula is one of the given options. Let's see:

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) =72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O → 6*12=72 +10=10 +16=88. MW=72+10+16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2 → 72+10+32=114.

Option D: C6H12O →72+12+16=100.

The mass spectrum's fragment is at 45. Let me think about which of these, when broken apart, could have a fragment of 45.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then maybe it could lose certain groups. Let's see, 6 carbons and 10 H, 2 O. Suppose it's an ester, maybe.

For example, if the molecule is something like methyl cyclohex- something. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester: RCOOR'. For example, if it's an ester with a cyclohexyl group and a methyl group, but let me think about the molecular weight.

Wait, another approach: the fragment at m/z 45 could be from a common ion. For example, the tropylium ion is 91, but that's not 45. Maybe a CH2CH2O group as I thought, which is 45. So in the molecule, if there's a fragment that loses a larger part, leaving a smaller one. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethylene glycol-type structure, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Looking back at the IR. The 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ peaks. If there's a carbonyl, perhaps an ester (which has two carbonyls? No, esters have one carbonyl). Wait, wait, maybe one carbonyl from an ester and another from conjugation elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring. Because aromatic rings can have C=C stretching around 1600-1650. So perhaps the 1650 is an aromatic ring, and 1700 is the carbonyl.

But wait, if the molecule has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. Let's think—maybe it's a substituted benzaldehyde or something similar. Alternatively, maybe a ketone or an ester with an aromatic ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which could be from an aromatic ring if it's a mono-substituted benzene, but more likely, it's a vinyl group, like an alkene.

So putting that together: the compound has an alkene (from NMR) and a carbonyl (from IR). Also, perhaps an O-H group, given the broad peak in IR at 3000, which could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak, but their carbonyl is around 1700 cm⁻¹. However, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1700-1750. Wait, the IR shows 1700 and 1650. Hmm.

If the molecule has two carbonyl groups, that could explain the two peaks. But that would require two different carbonyl groups. So perhaps an ester and a ketone, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, one is a conjugated carbonyl. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. The conjugation would lower the wavenumber of the carbonyl. So, for example, in an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, the carbonyl peak is around 1680-1650 cm⁻¹. So maybe the 1650 is the conjugated ketone, and the 1700 could be an ester?

Wait, no. Ester carbonyls are around 1730-1750 typically. So that wouldn't fit. So maybe one carbonyl is at 1700 (like an ester or ketone) and the other is a conjugated double bond, but that's not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe the 1650 is a C=C stretch from an alkene.

So let's think about that. If the compound has a carbonyl group (like an ester) and a double bond, what would that look like?

Wait, an ester group would have a carbonyl around 1700, and the double bond (maybe as part of a ring or a substituent) would have a C=C stretch around 1650. But wait, the 1650 peak is strong, which suggests a strong absorption, perhaps indicating a conjugated double bond.

So, the molecule could have both a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Now, the O-H peak in IR suggests an -OH group, which could be an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But the presence of a carbonyl group might suggest it's more likely an ester, which would fit with an -O- group. Alternatively, a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the formula would include more oxygens. Let's look at the options again.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → 2 O.

B) C6H10O → 1 O.

C) C6H10O2 → 2 O.

D) C6H12O →1 O.

So, if there are two oxygen-containing groups, then either the molecule has an ester and an alcohol (two O), or a ketone and an ester, etc. Let's think about the possible structures.

Another point: the molecular formula. Let's see the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Assuming no N or X (halogens), so:

For example, option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond or a carbonyl.

But wait, in option C: C6H10O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU.

Since the molecule has a double bond (from NMR) and a carbonyl group (from IR), that's two DoU. So option C fits.

Option A: DoU=1. So only one ring or one double bond, but our data suggests two (double bond and carbonyl), so A is unlikely.

Option C: DoU=2. So two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

So that fits because we have a double bond and a carbonyl (each contributing one DoU).

Looking at the mass spectrum again: m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be a fragment that includes a carbonyl or an ethylene group.

Another approach: Let's consider the molecular formula and possible structures.

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's an ester with a cyclopentene ring or something similar.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. A six-membered ring with an ester linkage would have O in the ring and a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond.

Let's think about a structure with an ester group and a double bond. For example, methyl cyclohexene carboxylate. Wait, no, that might not fit the formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's an ortho ester or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something like methyl vinyl ketone, but that's more for lower molecular weight.

Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester group and a vinyl group. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at m/z=45.

Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH2)2O. So, if the molecule has a fragment of CH2CH2O, that's 45. How could that happen?

If the molecule is something like CH2CH2O-R, where R is some group, then the loss of R could leave the CH2CH2O group as a fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule breaks at a certain point, releasing a smaller fragment.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, then the possible structure could be something like methyl cyclopentene carboxylate. Let's see: the formula would be C6H10O2. So, cyclopentene would have 5 C, but wait, the ester would be R-O-CO-R'. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted diethyl maleate? Wait, not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular ion. The molecular weight would be 114 (option C: 6*12=72 +10=10 +32=32 → 72+10+32=114).

So, if the molecular ion breaks into a fragment of 45 and another part, maybe 114-45=69. Hmm, but 69 isn't a very common fragment. Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks into a 45 and another part. Wait, but 45 is a smaller fragment, so perhaps part of the molecule.

Alternatively, think about the possible functional groups. The IR suggests a carbonyl and an -OH group. Wait, but earlier I thought the IR peak at 3000 could be an -OH, but if the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, that might indicate an -OH group, perhaps as an alcohol.

Wait, but another possibility is that the peak is from an amide, but without NMR peaks indicating NH protons, that's less likely.

So, putting it together:

- FTIR: Broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ → -OH (alcohol).
- IR has peaks at 1700 (carbonyl) and 1650 (maybe C=C).
- 1H NMR shows vinyl hydrogens → double bond.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 → likely (CH2)2O.

So, the compound has both a carbonyl group and an alcohol group. So, perhaps it's a ester and an alcohol? Or a ketone and an alcohol?

Wait, if the compound is an ester, then the formula would have two oxygen atoms (since esters are R-O-CO-O-R', no, wait: an ester is RCOOR', so that's two oxygen atoms in the ester group. So, the formula would have two oxygen atoms. So options A and C have two oxygens.

Wait, but wait. Looking at the options, option A is C6H12O2, and option C is C6H10O2.

So, which of these has the right DoU and the right structure?

Earlier, I thought that the DoU for option C (C6H10O2) is 2, which matches two DoU from a carbonyl (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). So that makes sense.

So the structure would have a carbonyl (like an ester) and a double bond. Also, an -OH group.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has an ester group and an -OH, that would require three oxygens. Because ester is O-C-O and an -OH is another O. Oh wait, wait, no. Because the formula for option C is C6H10O2; that's two oxygens. So if the compound has an ester group (which has two oxygens), then how can it have an -OH group? That would require three oxygens.

Hmm, that suggests a problem. Because if the molecule has both an ester (which already uses two O's) and an -OH (another O), then the total O would be three. But the options only go up to two O (options A and C). So perhaps the IR peak at 3000 isn't an -OH but something else.

Wait, maybe the broad peak at 3000 is from an amide. But I don't have any NMR data that suggests amines. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Aldehydes have a strong absorption around 2800-2700 (stretching) and a sharp peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. But the peak here is broad, which is more characteristic of an -OH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an -NH group, but again, without NMR data, that's less likely.

Wait, maybe the peak at 3000 isn't an O-H but an N-H? But the options don't have nitrogen.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 3000 is an aromatic C-H stretch. But those are usually around 3000-3100 and are not very broad. The broadness suggests a hydrogen bond, like in an -OH group.

So, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Let me go back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is probably from a group like (CH2)2O. So, if the molecule has a (CH2)2O group, that would contribute to the formula. So, (CH2)2O is C2H4O.

So, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, subtracting C2H4O gives C4H6O. That's a possible fragment.

Wait, but 45 is the mass of the fragment. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but that would be 31 (CH3O+). No, that's 31. Hmm.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a CH2CH2O group. So, that would be two carbons, four hydrogens, and an oxygen. The formula for that would be C2H4O, molecular weight 45.

So, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. If the molecule has a CH2CH2O group attached to a larger structure, perhaps a ring or another group.

Another thought: Maybe the molecule is an ortho ester. For example, a cyclic structure with an ester group and an oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester, but that would require more oxygens.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. A lactone has an ester group, so two oxygens. Let's see: a six-membered ring lactone would have the ester group, so the structure would be something like cyclopentyl something. Wait, but the molecular formula is C6H10O2.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. Suppose the molecule is an ester with a cyclopentene ring. For example, cyclopentene rings often have 5 carbons, plus a COO group. Let me see: cyclopentene would be 5 C, then maybe a COOCH3 group, which would bring it to 5+1 (COO) +1 (CH3) = 7? That's beyond 6. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps a methyl ester of a cyclopentene carboxylic acid. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Let's see: cyclopentene is C5H8. The acid would be C5H7COOH, but as an ester, it's C5H7COOCH3. So that would be C6H10O2. Yes, that fits.

So, the structure is methyl cyclopentene-1-carboxylate. So, the molecule has a cyclopentene ring (with a double bond, explaining the vinyl hydrogens in NMR), an ester group (so carbonyl at 1700 cm⁻¹), and the cyclopentene's C=C would have a peak at around 1650 cm⁻¹.

Wait, but then where does the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ come from? There's no -OH group in this structure. Hmm. Unless it's another functional group.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see the options again.

Another approach: Let's compute the molecular formula for each option and see which makes the most sense with the data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond. But our data suggests two DoU (double bond and carbonyl), so option A is less likely.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU: (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. Could be a double bond and a carbonyl. But the formula has only one O, so where is the O? Maybe an ester isn't possible here because that requires two O. So perhaps a ketone and an alcohol. But then, the IR would have a peak for the ketone (around 1700), and an O-H for the alcohol.

But the IR has two peaks: 1700 and 1650. If it's a ketone, 1700 makes sense. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond or an aromatic ring. If the molecule has a conjugated double bond, that's another DoU. So that fits the two DoU.

But then, the mass spec. If the formula is C6H10O, the fragment at 45 would need to fit. Let's imagine the molecule is something like cyclohexenone (C6H10O). But cyclohexenone has a ketone (DoU=1 from C=O and one from the double bond, totaling two). But cyclohexenone's molecular formula is C6H10O. So that fits.

In that case, the IR would show a strong peak at around 1700 (the ketone), and 1650 for the C=C. The broad peak at 3000 would be from an -OH group, but cyclohexenone doesn't have an -OH. Hmm. So that's a problem. Because our IR has that broad peak, which suggests an -OH group, but in cyclohexenone, there's no -OH. So perhaps this option doesn't fit.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So two DoU. Could be a carbonyl and a double bond. The IR fits. The formula has two O's. So maybe an ester and a double bond. But earlier I thought about the structure having an ester and a double bond, but without an -OH group.

Wait, in that case, the IR's broad peak at 3000 would have to come from something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's an -OH group, but the formula only has two O's. So if the molecule is an ester (two O's), how can it have an -OH group? That would require three O's. So perhaps the broad peak isn't from an -OH but from something else.

Wait, another possibility: the IR's broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is from an -NH group, but that's unlikely without NMR data supporting it. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde's C-H stretch, but aldehydes usually have a sharp peak around 2820 and 2720 cm⁻¹, not a broad one.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from an amide, but again, without supporting NMR data, that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak is from an aromatic ring with conjugated substituents, but that usually doesn't produce such a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's a C-H stretch in a conjugated system, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the peak isn't O-H but an N-H, but the options don't include nitrogen.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think about the mass spec again. The fragment at m/z=45.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), and a fragment is 45, which is (CH2)2O, perhaps the molecule has a group like CH2CH2O attached to another part.

Alternatively, the molecule could be an ester of a diol, but that would require more O's, which isn't the case here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is an ortho ester, which might have the structure R-O-CO-O-R. But that would have more oxygen, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So, for example, a five-membered ring lactone would have a structure like:

O
||
O-C-O

But the exact structure isn't clear. But in any case, a lactone would have an ester group, so the IR would show a peak around 1700, and a double bond somewhere else.

But then, where does the O-H come from? If it's a lactone, there wouldn't be an -OH group. So that would contradict the IR data.

Wait, perhaps the compound isn't a lactone. Maybe it's an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is methyl cyclohex-2-enecarboxylate. Structure would be O

      COOCH3
      |
cyclohexene ring with a double bond.

In that case, the ester group (O and COO) gives two O's, and the cyclohexene has a double bond. The IR would show 1700 for the ester and 1650 for the conjugated double bond (since the carbonyl is conjugated with the double bond, so lower wavenumber).

The NMR would show peaks for the vinyl (alkene) hydrogens. The broad peak at 3000 in IR would still be an issue. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the compound has an -OH group in addition to the ester. But then the O count would be three, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the broad peak isn't an -OH.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from a conjugated carbonyl and a double bond. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an error in the problem statement.

Wait, let me think about the mass spec again. If the fragment is 45, which is (CH2)2O, then perhaps the molecule is something like CH2CH2O-R, where R is another group.

So, for example, if the molecule is (CH2)2O-CO-R, but that would require more O's.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a diether, but that's unlikely given the IR data.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment isn't (CH2)2O, but something else.

Wait, 45 could also be the methyl group with a carbonyl. Hmm, like CH3CO+ would have a mass of 43 (CH3CO has 43, but that's 43, not 45). Alternatively, maybe CH3CH2O+ (45-16=29 would be the rest, but I'm not sure).

Another approach: possible structures for each option and their compatibility with the data.

Option C: C6H10O2.

Assuming the structure is an ester with a double bond. Suppose it's methyl cyclopent-1-enecarboxylate.

The structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
      |
cyclopentene ring with a double bond.

In this case, the IR would show 1700 for the ester and 1650 for the conjugated double bond in the cyclopentene.

The NMR would show peaks for the vinyl (alkene) hydrogens.

The mass spec would have a fragment at 45, perhaps from the (CH2)2O group.

But then, where does the broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ come from? There's no -OH in this structure.

Hmm. Maybe the broad peak is from something else, such as an aromatic ring, but I don't see how that would produce a broad peak.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak at 3000 is from an aldehyde's C-H stretch. But then, the IR would have a peak at around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde's C-H. But the given data doesn't mention those.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but that would require three O's, which isn't possible with option C.

This is tricky. Let me try to think about each option and see which fits the data best.

Option C: C6H10O2.

DoU=2. So two rings or double bonds. The IR has two carbonyl peaks, perhaps one is the ester and the other is conjugated.

The NMR has vinyl H, so a double bond.

Mass spec has a fragment at 45, which could be (CH2)2O.

So, the structure with a conjugated double bond and ester would fit. The broad peak in IR might not be an -OH but something else, but perhaps I'm missing another group.

Wait, another thought: the compound could be an ester with a conjugated diene. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diketone, but that would give a higher IR peak.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the broad IR peak is from a carbonyl and an O-H in a different environment. But I'm not sure.

Well, between the options, option C has the correct number of DoU and the possibility of having both a carbonyl and a double bond.

So putting it all together, the most likely answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound based on FTIR, ¹H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options provided are C₆H₁₂O₂, C₆H₁₀O, C₆H₁₀O₂, and C₆H₁₂O. Each piece of data is analyzed to determine the most likely molecular formula.

### FTIR Analysis:
- A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond (C=C).

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** confirm the presence of a double bond (C=C).

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests a fragment with the formula **C₂H₄O**, such as a CH₂CH₂O group.

### Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):
- **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂):**  
  DoU = 1. This indicates only one degree of unsaturation (e.g., a single ring or double bond), which does not match the data (two DoU are required: one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond).
- **Option B (C₆H₁₀O):**  
  DoU = 2. This matches the two DoU required (one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond). However, this formula has only one oxygen atom, making it unlikely to include both a carbonyl group and an -OH group.
- **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂):**  
  DoU = 2. This matches the two DoU required (one for the carbonyl and one for the double bond). The two oxygen atoms allow for the presence of both a carbonyl group and an -OH group, fitting the IR data.
- **Option D (C₆H₁₂O):**  
  DoU = 1. This indicates only one degree of unsaturation, which does not match the data (two DoU are required).

### Conclusion:
The compound must have two degrees of unsaturation, a carbonyl group, and a double bond. The IR data supports the presence of an -OH group, and the Mass Spectrometry data aligns with a fragment of **C₂H₄O**. Among the options, **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option C) satisfies all the criteria, including the correct number of oxygen atoms and degrees of unsaturation.

**Answer: C**
