Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens to their flux when a particular part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III process stopped, the effect on the neutrinos we detect would depend on how quickly the change propagates. But since the time is the same as light travel time, any change would have reached us by now. But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands. So, I need to figure out what these bands correspond to in terms of neutrino production.

So, the pp-III process is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core. The proton-proton chain has a few branches, right? The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces a helium-4 nucleus. Then there are others, like pp-II and pp-III. I think the pp-III branch produces a boron-8 nucleus, which then decays into carbon-8 and emits a positron and a neutrino. Oh wait, or is it that the pp-III involves creating a heavier nucleus, maybe with more protons and neutrons?

Wait, I remember that the pp-III branch is actually a side reaction where two protons fuse into a diproton, and then one of them emits a positron and a neutrino to become a helium-3 nucleus. So that process produces a helium-3 and a positron and a neutrino. Or was it two protons fusing into a boron-8, which then decays into Be-8 and emits a positron and neutrino?

Wait, no, the pp-III branch is the process where two protons (each with charge +1) form a diproton (charge +2). The diproton is unstable, so it emits a positron and a neutrino, becoming a helium-3 nucleus. So the pp-III reaction is p + p → 2p → (p → e+ + ν_e + p). So each pp-III event produces one neutrino, right? And that neutrino has a certain energy.

Now, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out which processes contribute to these bands.

Wait, but neutrinos from the Sun are mostly from the proton-proton chain. The main source is the pp-I, which produces a helium-4 and emits a neutrino. But wait, no, the pp-I reaction is p + p → 2H (deuterium) + e+ + ν. So each of the two main branches in the proton-proton chain produce neutrinos.

But wait, the majority of solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, right? Because that's the dominant fusion process in the Sun. The pp-II and pp-III are minor branches. So if the pp-III suddenly stops, the total neutrino flux from that process would drop to zero. But how much of the total solar neutrino flux does pp-III contribute?

I remember that the pp-III branch produces a smaller number of neutrinos compared to the main pp-I branch. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrino flux from that source would drop, but the majority (pp-I) continues.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between the two energy bands, 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So I need to figure out which energy range corresponds to which reaction.

The neutrinos from the pp-I process have a lower energy compared to those from the pp-III process. Because in the pp-I reaction, each step releases a neutrino when a proton converts into a neutron. The energy released is about 0.42 MeV per neutrino, I think. So the neutrinos from pp-I are around 0.4 MeV, or 400 keV. So band 1 (700-800 keV) is higher than that.

Wait, but the pp-III reaction: the diproton (pp) decay emits a neutrino. The energy in that case is higher. Let me think: the mass of the diproton is about 2.014 atomic mass units (since each proton is about 1.007). When it decays into a helium-3 (1.016 atomic mass units) and emits a positron and a neutrino. The mass difference is about 0.002 atomic mass units, which converts to energy. 1 atomic mass unit is about 931 MeV, so 0.002 * 931 = ~1.86 MeV. But since the positron takes some energy, the neutrino from pp-III would have an energy around 1.8 MeV. Wait, but that's way higher than both bands. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I got the process wrong. Let me think again. The pp-III process: two protons collide, form a diproton (a bound state), which then undergoes beta-plus decay: p + p → 2p → p + e+ + ν + p. So the mass excess comes from the diproton. The diproton has a mass of about 2 * (mass of a proton) minus binding energy. But the binding energy in the diproton is small. The mass of the diproton is about 2.014 (sum of two protons) minus binding energy. But when it emits a positron and neutrino, it becomes a helium-3 nucleus. So the mass of the helium-3 is about 3.016 atomic mass units. Wait, no, helium-3 has a mass of about 3.016 amu. So: the diproton (2.014 amu) emits a positron (mass about 0.00055 amu) and neutrino (negligible), and becomes a helium-3 (3.016 amu). Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because 2.014 amu is less than 3.016. So that's impossible. Wait, perhaps I've got the reaction wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the diproton (pp) decays into two protons, a positron, and a neutrino. So the process is p + p → p + e+ + ν + p, which is the same as 2p → 2p + e+ + ν. Wait, that can't be, because the two protons on the left and right would cancel. So maybe the reaction is p + p → 2p → (p + p → 2p → p + e+ + ν_e + p). So each pp-III event emits a single neutrino. The mass difference would be the mass of the diproton minus the mass of a helium-3. Wait, but helium-3 has higher mass than the diproton? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the diproton (mass 2.014 amu) decays into a helium-3 (mass 3.016 amu) plus a positron and a neutrino. But that would require that 2.014 amu = 3.016 amu + (mass of positron) + (neutrino mass). Which is impossible because 2.014 < 3.016. So I must have the reaction wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the pp-I and pp-III reactions. Let me look up in my memory. The main proton-proton chain is pp-I: two protons collide, form a deuterium nucleus (2H), emit a positron and a neutrino, which turns one proton into a neutron, creating deuterium. So the neutrino from pp-I is about 0.42 MeV. Then, in the pp-II branch, a deuterium nucleus fuses with a proton to form tritium (3H), which then decays into helium-3 and emits a neutrino. The neutrino from pp-II is higher energy, around 1.4 MeV. And the pp-III branch produces a diproton, which decays into a helium-3 and emits a neutrino. Wait, but that would require the diproton to have a higher mass than the helium-3. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III process produces a boron-8 nucleus. Let me think: The process is p + p + p + p → boron-8, which then decays into Be-8, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But boron-8 has a mass of around 8.005 amu, and Be-8 is about 8.007 amu. Wait, no, that's the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps the process is p + p → boron-8 (which is unstable), which then decays into Be-7 plus a positron and a neutrino. So the neutrino from pp-III would have higher energy than both pp-I and pp-II.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to remember the neutrino energies from these processes. The pp-I neutrinos are about 0.42 MeV. The pp-II, which is the deuterium-tritium fusion, produces a neutrino with higher energy, perhaps around 1.4 MeV. The pp-III is the main source of boron-8, which then decays into Be-8, emitting a neutrino of around 3.7 MeV, I think. Or maybe around 17 MeV? No, that's way too high. Wait, no, the neutrinos from the boron-8 decay are around 3.7 MeV. So they're higher energy.

Wait, but in the question, the two bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. So 0.7 to 0.9 MeV and 0.8 to 0.9 MeV. Wait, 0.7 MeV is 700 keV, 0.8 MeV is 800 keV, 0.9 MeV is 900 keV. So the pp-I neutrinos are about 0.42 MeV, which is below band 1. The pp-II neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is above both bands. The pp-III neutrinos are about 3.7 MeV, which is way above both bands.

Wait, so if the pp-III stopped, which neutrinos would be affected? The neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy, about 3.7 MeV, which is way above the 900 keV mentioned. So if the pp-III stopped, the higher energy neutrinos would decrease. But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between band 1 and band 2. So what's the contribution of each band to the flux?

But why would the flux ratio change if pp-III stopped? Because pp-III produces neutrinos in higher energy bands, perhaps bands 1 and 2 are in the range where their contribution is minimal. Or maybe I have the energy ranges wrong.

Wait another approach: if the pp-III branch stopped, which neutrino sources would change? The main pp-I and pp-II would continue. So the lower energy neutrinos (0.42 MeV) are from pp-I (band below 700 keV), the pp-II neutrinos are about 1.4 MeV, which is above band 2 (800-900 keV, which is 0.8-0.9 MeV). Wait, 1.4 MeV is 1400 keV, which is above 900 keV, so outside both bands. So the two bands in the question are lower than the pp-II neutrinos.

Hmm, so if the pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (around 3.7 MeV) would stop, but those are way above the bands in question. So the flux in both bands 1 and 2 would remain the same, because their sources (pp-I and pp-II) are unaffected. So the ratio would stay the same.

Wait, but that can't be the case. Because the question is implying that the ratio changes.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding which neutrinos come from which process. Let me think again. The pp-III process produces a diproton which then decays into a helium-3. Let me calculate the energy of that neutrino.

In the pp-III process: two protons (each about 938 MeV) form a diproton with a binding energy of about 0.1 MeV (I think the diproton has a binding energy of about 0.1 MeV, so the mass is roughly 2 * 938 - 0.1 ≈ 1875.9 MeV). Then, when the diproton decays into a helium-3 (which has a mass of about 3.016 amu, which is 3 * 938 ≈ 2814 MeV minus binding energy, but I'm not sure about exact numbers). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of the mass difference.

The reaction is:

2p → 2p → p + e+ + ν + p → 2p → (p + e+ + ν) + p → 2p → 2p → p + p → 2p → p + e+ + ν + p.

Wait, perhaps the correct reaction is:

p + p → p + e+ + ν + p → 2p → 2p → 2p → 2p → 2p → two protons but one emits a positron and neutrino, leading to two protons, one of which becomes a neutron (so making helium-3).

Wait, perhaps another approach: the mass of the diproton is about 2.014 amu. The mass of the helium-3 is about 3.016 amu. So when the diproton decays into a helium-3, the mass difference is 3.016 - 2.014 = 1.002 amu. The binding would require energy, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the diproton is lighter than the helium-3, so the decay would not be possible unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the diproton (mass 2.014) decays into a helium-3 (3.016) plus a positron and a neutrino. Because 2.014 amu is less than 3.016 amu, this can't happen unless there's some mass deficit. Oh, wait, perhaps I should consider the rest masses. Let me convert to energy.

1 amu = 931.5 MeV. So:

diproton mass: 2.014 amu → 2.014 *931.5 ≈ 1883.5 MeV.
Helium-3 mass: 3.016 amu → 3.016 *931.5 ≈ 2807.7 MeV.

So the diproton (1883.5 MeV) can't decay into a helium-3 (2807.7 MeV) plus a positron (mass 0.00055 GeV = 0.55 MeV) and a neutrino (mass ~0). So the sum of the products would be 2807.7 + 0.55 ≈ 2808.25 MeV, which is way larger than the diproton's mass. So the reaction is impossible. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have the wrong reaction.

Maybe the diproton decays into a different product. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction p + p → 2H (deuterium) + e+ + ν, which is the pp-I branch. Or maybe the pp-III is part of a different process. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III process produces a boron-8 nucleus, which then decays into Be-8 + e+ + ν. So let's think about that.

Boron-8 has a mass of about 8.005 amu. Be-8 has a mass of about 8.007 amu. So the mass difference is 0.002 amu, which is about 0.002 * 931 MeV ≈ 1.86 MeV. This energy would be emitted as the positron and neutrino. So the neutrino from this decay would have an energy of about 1.86 MeV minus the positron's energy (about 0.511 MeV), so approximately 1.35 MeV. Wait, but that's around 1.35 MeV, which is higher than both bands in question (0.7-0.9 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV). So if the pp-III process stops, the neutrinos from boron-8 decay (which are about 1.35 MeV) would stop. But the bands are much lower than that.

Wait, but the bands are 0.7-0.9 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So the neutrinos from pp-I (0.42 MeV) are in a lower band, the pp-III neutrinos (say, 1.35 MeV) are in a higher band.

So if the pp-III stops, the flux of neutrinos in higher energy bands (like 1-2 MeV) would drop, but the question is about the ratio between two lower bands.

So the neutrinos in band 1 (700-800 keV) and band 2 (800-900 keV) are from the same source, perhaps the pp-I process. Because pp-I produces about 0.42 MeV neutrinos, which are below 700 keV. So if pp-III is stopped, which doesn't contribute to these bands, then the ratio of band 1 to band 2 would remain the same. So the ratio would be 1, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Because if the bands are 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, and the neutrinos from pp-I are about 0.42 MeV (420 keV), they don't contribute to either band. So the only source contributing to these bands must be another process.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the neutrino types. There are also neutrinos from the CNO cycle, but I don't think they're relevant here. The question specifies that pp-III stopped, so it's about the proton-proton chain.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III process produces neutrinos in the bands in question. Let me re-examine.

In the pp-III process, the diproton decays into a positron and a neutrino. What's the energy of that neutrino?

The diproton has a mass of about 2.014 amu. When it decays into a proton (1.007 amu), a positron (0.00054858 amu), and a neutrino, the energy released would be:

diproton mass = 2.014 * 931.5 MeV ≈ 1883.5 MeV.

Proton: 1.007 * 931.5 ≈ 938 MeV.
Positron: 0.00054858 * 931.5 ≈ 0.511 MeV.
Neutrino: negligible.

So the total after decay would be 938 + 0.511 + (energy in neutrino) ≈ 938.511 MeV.

So the mass difference is 1883.5 - 938.511 ≈ 944.989 MeV. Wait, that can't be right. Because 2 protons making a diproton have a mass of 1876.9 MeV (since 2*938.9 MeV). The diproton's binding energy is about 0.1 MeV, making its mass about 2.014 amu. Wait, maybe I should compute the mass difference correctly.

Alternatively, the process is:

p + p → 2p → p + e+ + ν + p.

So the initial mass is 2p: 2 * 938.9 MeV = 1877.8 MeV.

After decay, you have two protons (1877.8 MeV), a positron (0.511 MeV), and a neutrino (which is very light, so negligible). So the total after decay is 1877.8 + 0.511 ≈ 1878.311 MeV.

The initial mass is 1877.8 MeV. So the mass difference is 1878.311 - 1877.8 = 0.511 MeV. So all of that goes into the positron and the neutrino. But the positron has a rest mass of 0.511 MeV, so the neutrino would get the remaining energy. Wait, but that's zero because the initial mass is 1877.8, and after decay, the mass is 1877.8 + 0.511 (the positron) + neutrino. So the diproton's mass must have been higher than the sum of the products. So the correct approach would be:

diproton mass (2p) = 2 * (mass of p) - binding energy. So let's say the diproton has a binding energy of about 0.1 MeV, so its mass is 2*938.9 - 0.1 ≈ 1877.7 MeV.

After decay, the two protons (1877.7 MeV) plus the mass converted into energy. So the decay products are two protons, a positron, and a neutrino. The mass of the products is 1877.7 + 0.511 (positron) + (mass of neutrino, negligible). So the diproton's mass is 1877.7 MeV. So the decay would require that 1877.7 = 1877.7 + 0.511 + something. That's impossible unless I got the reaction wrong.

Wait, perhaps the diproton is heavier than two protons? No, that can't be. Because binding energy reduces the mass. So I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the energy of the neutrino from the pp-III process. If the pp-III process stops, what neutrinos are affected? The ones with higher energy. So the neutrinos in the bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV (0.7-0.9 MeV) might be from the pp-II process. Because the pp-II process produces a neutrino around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than both bands. Hmm, but that's not in the bands. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong about the energy of the neutrinos from the different branches. Let me try to recall some data. The main solar neutrinos come from the pp-I process, which are about 0.42 MeV (420 keV). The pp-II process produces neutrinos about 1.4 MeV. The pp-III produces around 3.7 MeV. So the pp-III neutrinos are at higher energies, outside the given bands.

So if the pp-III process stops, then the neutrino flux at higher energies (like 3.7 MeV) would drop, but that doesn't affect the bands 0.7-0.9 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. So the ratio between these two bands wouldn't change because both are coming from the same source (pp-I and pp-II, but their neutrinos are outside these bands). Or wait, maybe the bands are from another process.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the energy bands where the pp-III neutrinos are. But since they're at 3.7 MeV, that's way beyond 900 keV, so stopping pp-III would have no effect on the flux in bands 1 and 2.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands. If the pp-III process contributes neutrinos to both bands, but one more than the other, then stopping it would change the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again. The pp-III process produces a neutrino, but perhaps its energy is around 0.7 MeV. So if the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would drop significantly compared to band 2 (800-900 keV). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. If the pp-III process is stopped, how much does it affect the neutrino flux in each band? Suppose that band 1 (700-800 keV) has neutrinos from both pp-I and pp-III, while band 2 (800-900 keV) has neutrinos only from pp-I. Or maybe the other way around.

But if the neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy than both bands, then stopping pp-III wouldn't affect either band. So the flux ratio remains the same as before. So the answer would be C) 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have energies in the range of 0.7-0.9 MeV. In that case, the band 1 would have a contribution from pp-III, while band 2 would have some as well, but perhaps more. If pp-III contributes a lot to band 1 and a little to band 2, then stopping it would cause band 1 flux to drop, making the ratio band1/band2 lower.

But without knowing the exact neutrino energies from each process, it's hard to tell. But according to what I remember, the pp-I neutrinos are around 0.4 MeV, pp-II around 1.4 MeV, and pp-III around 3.7 MeV. So if that's correct, then both bands in the question (0.7-0.9 MeV) are between pp-I and pp-II. So the neutrinos in these bands would come from processes between 0.4 and 1.4 MeV. But how?

Wait, maybe the neutrinos in the bands are the same as the pp-I process. But if pp-I is unaffected, then the flux in both bands would be the same as before. So the ratio would be 1. But wait, the pp-III process produces higher energy neutrinos, so it doesn't contribute to these bands. Therefore, stopping pp-III would have no effect on the flux in these bands, so the ratio remains the same.

So the answer should be C) 1.


The question involves analyzing the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) after the pp-III branch of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor to the Sun's neutrino flux, producing higher-energy neutrinos compared to the dominant pp-I branch. Here's the analysis:

1. **Neutrino Energies from Different Processes**:
   - The pp-I branch produces neutrinos with energies around 0.42 MeV (420 keV), which are below the energy bands in question (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV).
   - The pp-II branch produces neutrinos with energies around 1.4 MeV, which are above both bands.
   - The pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies around 3.7 MeV, which are far above the given bands.

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:
   - Since the pp-III neutrinos are emitted at energies much higher than the specified bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV), stopping this branch would not affect the flux in these bands.
   - The neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands are primarily produced by other processes, such as the pp-I and pp-II branches, which are unaffected by the cessation of the pp-III branch.

3. **Flux Ratio Between the Bands**:
   - The flux ratio between the two bands depends on the relative contributions of neutrinos from the pp-I and pp-II branches within these energy ranges. Since the pp-III branch does not contribute to these bands, the ratio remains unchanged.

Given that the pp-III branch does not contribute to the specified energy bands, the flux ratio between the two bands (700-800 keV and 800-900 keV) remains the same as before the pp-III branch stopped. Therefore, the ratio is **1**.

Answer: C
