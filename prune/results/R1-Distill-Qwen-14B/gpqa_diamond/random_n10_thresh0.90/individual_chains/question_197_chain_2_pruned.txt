Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectroscopy data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on its IR and NMR data, then figuring out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let me look at the IR data. IR tells us about functional groups. The strong peaks I see are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the peaks, 3400 is a broad peak, but for O-H, maybe. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which I remember is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe an acid. Next, 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Putting that together, the IR suggests an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, maybe an acid, ester, or ketone, and an aromatic ring. The broad peak in 3400-2500 might be an -OH from a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000 and a strong peak around 1700. Wait, but 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid. Hmm, maybe it's an ester? Because esters have a carbonyl around 1740-1700? Or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, could it be a conjugated carbonyl? Like a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl.

Wait, the 1720 is a strong peak. Let me think: carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, maybe not as much as an alcohol. The 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone, but if it's a ketone, where is the C=O for that? Wait, but the IR also shows aromatic peaks, which suggests that the carbonyl is part of an aromatic substituent.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a really high chemical shift—could that be an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid? Another possibility is an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm, but the broadness suggests maybe a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an acidic proton like from an enol, but that's less likely.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest two sets of protons, probably para to each other. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents on the para positions. Wait, but each is a double
