Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think it through.

The setup is a bit complicated. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The cavity has radius r, and r is less than R. So the conductor is like a bigger sphere with a smaller hollow inside it.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. When a conductor is neutral, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface will induce an equal and opposite charge. But wait, wait, the conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced -q charge. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so the inner surface's induced -q would make the conductor have a net charge, but how does that work?

Wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral. So when you place a charge inside its cavity, the inner surface must have an induced charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the enclosed charge. So the inner surface has -q. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have +q because the total charge on the conductor is zero. Wait, no! Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q so that the sum is zero. Or wait, no. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface must have +q to balance it. So the conductor as a whole is neutral.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the net charge is zero. So the inner surface has -q (because it's induced by the +q in the cavity), and the outer
