Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again.

Compound X has some IR and NMR data. It's reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are A to D.

First, let me look at the spectroscopic data. Let's start with the IR. The IR shows strong peaks around 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But looking at the options, they don't seem to have amines. Wait, maybe it's O-H from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, probably a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So that's likely a benzene ring.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's list the signals:

- 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. A broad peak at this region is probably an O-H stretch, like in a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be broad, which matches. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton could be around 9-10, but this is higher. Another possibility is an acidic proton, like from a phenol, but phenols are usually around 5-7. So maybe this is a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe para-substituted.

- 7.2 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. Same as above, perhaps the other two in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe a para-disubstituted ring. Like a para-substituted benzene where the two protons are each next to substituents.

Wait, a doublet in aromatic region could be a case of two protons adjacent to substituents. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, maybe.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm, multiplet, 1H. That could be a CH next to an electronegative group or maybe a carbonyl. Or perhaps a methine group in an isopropyl or similar.

- 1.7 ppm, multiplet, 2H. Maybe a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen or in a chain.

- 1.4 ppm, doublet, 3H. That's likely a methyl group attached to something else, perhaps like a CH(CH3). Because a doublet for a methyl usually comes from being next to a CH with two protons, like in an ethyl group. Wait, no, for CH(CH3), the methyl would split into a doublet if the CH has two protons. Hmm.

- 0.9 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's a typical ethyl group's end. So maybe a CH2CH2 group, where the CH2 is connected to something else.

Putting this together: A benzene ring with substituents. The IR has a carbonyl, which could be a ketone or carboxylic acid. The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet is a methyl attached to a CH—so maybe a CH(CH3) group. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, let me think about the substituents on the benzene. The aromatic protons are in two doublets, which are each 2H. So perhaps the benzene has two substituents in the para positions. For example, a substituent in position 4 and another in position 1. Or wait, another possibility is that the substituents are in positions 1 and 4, but that would lead to a certain NMR pattern.

Wait, let me think about the substituents. If the aromatic protons are split into two doublets each integrating to 2H, perhaps the substituents are in the para position relative to each other. For example, a substituent at position 4 and another at position 1 (but that's the same as para). No, wait, para is 1 and 4. Let me think, if the substituent is at position 4, and there are two substituents, maybe each substituent is at position 4 and another at position 1? No, that's the same as para.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring is substituted in positions 1 and 4 with two substituents each. Wait, but that might complicate the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a substituent at position 4, and another group at position 1 (same as para), but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the ortho positions. But then the coupling would be more complex. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is in the para position and has an adjacent substituent that affects the aromatic protons.

Wait, perhaps it's a para-methyl group. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a ketone group attached to the benzene.

Wait, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's an aryl ketone. Or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad. The 10.5 ppm peak could be that. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Wait, but let me look at the substituents. The NMR shows at 2.9 ppm, 1H, which could be the CH in the sec-butyl group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is the methyl attached to the CH. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) would be the CH2 group between the CH and the benzene. The 0.9 triplet is the end CH2CH2. So that fits a sec-butyl group.

So the structure would be benzene with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. Let's see: the carboxylic acid would be in position 1, and the sec-butyl in position 4, which would be para.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be the ortho positions to the substituents. So for benzoic acid, the adjacent protons would be at positions 2 and 6, and the other substituent is at position 4, so the protons at positions 3 and 5 would be next to substituents.

Wait, no. Let me imagine the benzene ring. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, the ring is para-substituted. Let's say substituent A is at position 1 (carboxylic acid), substituent B is at position 4 (sec-butyl). Then, the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6.

Each of these would have coupling with adjacent protons. So the H at position 2 would be next to H at 3, which is next to substituent B (position 4). Similarly, position 6 would be next to 5.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have two doublets each integrating 2H. So perhaps the substituents are such that the aromatic protons are in two pairs of doublets.

Alternatively, considering that the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons might be split into two sets: the two H's adjacent to substituent A (the carboxylic acid) and the two H's adjacent to substituent B (the sec-butyl).

So, for example, the H's in positions 2 and 6 (adjacent to the carboxylic acid at 1) would be deshielded and appear around higher ppm (like 8.0), while the H's in positions 3 and 5 (adjacent to the sec-butyl at 4) would appear lower, around 7.2 ppm. But wait, in the NMR, the higher ppm (8.0) is the doublet for 2H, and the lower (7.2) is another doublet for 2H.

So that fits: the two H's adjacent to the electron-withdrawing group (the carboxylic acid) would be more deshielded and appear upfield. Wait, actually, carboxylic acid is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield (higher ppm). So the 8.0 ppm protons are next to the carboxylic acid, and the 7.2 ppm are next to the sec-butyl group.

So the NMR makes sense.

So the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes by removing the oxygen. But wait, wait. Clemmensen reduces ketones (RCOR') to RCH2R'. But wait, the starting material here is a benzoic acid (option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid). So if we treat it with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong reducing agent.

Wait, wait, but the Clemmensen reduction is specifically for ketones. For carboxylic acids, another reaction comes to mind. Alternatively, maybe it's a decarboxylation reaction.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI could be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones as well, converting them to alkanes by eliminating CO. But again, that's for ketones.

Wait, but wait, if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, maybe the reaction is different. Let me think: HI is a strong acid. Red phosphorus is sometimes used in decarboxylation reactions. For example, the reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes typically involves LiAlH4, but that's for reducing the acid to the alcohol. But in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Wait, another option is the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for halogenation of carboxylic acids. Not relevant here.

Wait, let me think. In some cases, when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to the elimination of water and the formation of an alkane. For example, I think the reaction of a carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus might lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent where the carbonyl becomes a CH2 group.

Wait, more accurately, the reaction would be converting the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group. Or perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, no, let's think about the mechanism.

Red phosphorus and HI can cause the reduction of certain functional groups. For a carboxylic acid, perhaps it's being converted into a methyl group.

Wait, another approach: the reaction conditions also might be for the reduction of a carbonyl group. So if the starting material is a ketone, the Clemmensen reduction would remove the carbonyl oxygen, turning RCO into RCH2.

But in our case, the starting material is a carboxylic acid. Let me think about the possible reaction.

Wait, another reaction I remember is the Arndt-Eistert reaction, which is a chain extension, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. For example, in the presence of a strong reducing agent, the carboxylic acid could lose CO2 and form a hydrocarbon.

Wait, I think that when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can lead to the formation of an alkane via the removal of the COOH group. So, for example, benzoic acid would become toluene, but only under certain conditions.

Wait, more accurately, the reaction might convert the carboxylic acid into a methyl group. Or perhaps the acid is reduced to an alcohol, but that requires a different reagent.

Wait, but how about if the starting compound is a ketone? Then the Clemmensen would reduce it. But the options don't have a ketone. Wait, the starting compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, according to the NMR and IR.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused because I'm thinking about the reaction conditions. Let me think again.

The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

Red phosphorus and HI are used to reduce carbonyl groups, especially ketones, to CH2 groups. But carboxylic acids are not directly reduced by this method. So maybe X has a ketone group, not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, what if the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a ketone, not a carboxylic acid? Then, perhaps X is a ketone, and the reaction would reduce it.

But earlier, the NMR had a peak at 10.5 ppm, which I thought was a carboxylic acid O-H. But if it's a ketone, then where is the O-H?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the data.

The IR shows 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, maybe an O-H stretch. But another possibility is an =CH2 group. No, wait, =CH2 would have a peak around 3000 cm-1, but that's within the range. Alternatively, an alcohol O-H would be in that range, but if it's a ketone, there's no O-H, so that peak might be something else.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this compound, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would do what?

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone, like benzophenone derivative, and the reaction reduces the ketone.

Wait, but looking at the NMR again, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, which is 1H. If it's a ketone, that peak wouldn't be there. So maybe that 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or a doublet. However, if it's an aldehyde, then the IR would show a strong peak around 2820 and 2720 cm-1 (the aldehyde C-H stretch), but in the given IR data, it's 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, possibly O-H. So perhaps it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 1720 cm-1 is an ester or a ketone. If it's an ester, the O-H would be less likely unless it's another functional group. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR shows a carbonyl but the O-H is from an alcohol. But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid O-H than an alcohol, which would typically be around 1-5 ppm as a broad peak.

So, perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction is a reduction of the acid.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think: carboxylic acids are generally not directly reduced by red phosphorus and HI. Maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, the final products after the reaction are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid – that's a carboxylic acid with a substituent.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene – that's a di-substituted benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid – same as starting material, but that can't be.

D)1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene – another di-substituted benzene.

Wait, so the reaction is converting X into one of these. So, the reaction is likely a reduction of a carbonyl group. So if X is a ketone, the product would have an alkyl group where the carbonyl was.

But looking at the options, the only possible ketone would be if X is an aryl ketone that gets reduced to an alkane. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, Option C is a benzoic acid. If X is that, and the reaction is decarboxylation to form a toluene derivative.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation where the carboxylic acid group is lost, and a methyl group is formed. But how?

Wait, let me think about the decarboxylation of benzoic acid. If benzoic acid is treated with a strong reducing agent, perhaps it undergoes decarboxylation to form toluene. But I'm not sure about the exact conditions.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a substitution. If the starting material is a benzoyl chloride or something, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group of the acid to a methylene group. But that would require a more powerful reducing agent.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material is a nitrile. But I don't think so because the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak around 2200 cm-1. So that's not it.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about each option and see which one makes sense after reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be a di-substituted benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups. How would that form from X?

If X is a benzophenone, perhaps, but again, I'm not sure.

Option D:1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That would be a di-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and methyl group.

Wait, but looking at the starting material's NMR, it has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is typical of a CH2CH2CH3 group. So perhaps the starting material has a longer chain, which upon reaction shortens.

Wait, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction reduces the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But wait, toluene is a methylbenzene. So 4-(sec-butyl)toluene would be 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which is option D.

Wait, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, no, that would be if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. If the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is benzene with substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (sec-butyl), then reducing the COOH to CH3 would give a methyl at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. So the product would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, but that's not the option. Wait, no, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that would be substituents at positions 1 and 4. So if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (position 1 is COOH, position 4 is sec-butyl), then the product would have substituents at 1 (CH3) and 4 (sec-butyl), which is 4-(sec-butyl)-1-methylbenzene. But the name would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

Wait, but is the reduction of a benzoic acid to toluene possible with red phosphorus and HI? I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a methyl benzoate ester or something else. But given the options and the data, I think the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the reaction is converting the COOH group into a methyl group, resulting in 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a ketone. Let me think again. If X is a ketone, it would have a carbonyl group. The NMR would show a peak at around 2.1 ppm for a ketone's CH3, but in the given data, the CH3 is at 1.4 and 0.9 ppm. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde. Then, the NMR would have a peak around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton. But the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, which could be that. Wait, but the IR doesn't show the aldehyde's C-H stretch, which is around 2800 and 2700 cm-1. The given IR shows 3400–2500, which is a broad range, possibly O-H.

Hmm. This is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about each option and what the starting material would be.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is this, and the reagent is red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong reducing agent, what would happen?

Red phosphorus and HI can sometimes be used to reduce esters or acids. Wait, when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it might undergo a reaction called the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction, but that's for amines. No, perhaps not.

Wait, another possibility is that the acid is converted to an acid chloride first, but I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a -CH2 group. So, the product would be benzene with a CH2 group where the COOH was, and the substituent would be the sec-butyl group.

So, if the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-methyl-4-(sec-butyl)benzene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, that's a different arrangement. So in option D, the substituents are at positions 1 (sec-butyl) and 4 (methyl). But in the starting material, the COOH is at position 1, and the
