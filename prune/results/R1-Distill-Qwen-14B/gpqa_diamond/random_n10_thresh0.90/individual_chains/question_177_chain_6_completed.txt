Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their radius and mass are both 1.5 times larger for Star_1 compared to Star_2. So, Star_1 is bigger in both size and mass. Interesting. The question mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I think that's referring to their peak emission wavelengths, which would relate to their temperatures via Wien's Law. 

Wien's Law states that the wavelength of maximum emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. The formula is λ_max * T = constant. So if their λ_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Oh wait, no, because if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same as well. Because rearranging Wien's Law, T = constant / λ_max. So same λ_max implies same temperature.

Then the question says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. I need to find that factor.

The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35. Since Star_1 is bigger, I expect it to have higher luminosity, but the exact factor is what I need.

Wait, but wait. The problem statement says the stars are radiating as black bodies. So the luminosity formula for a black body applies here. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, I can write the luminosity ratio L1/L2 as (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

From the problem, R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5.

Also, the peak wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2. Because λ_max is same, T is same. So T1/T2 = 1.

Putting that into the luminosity ratio: (1.5)^2 * (1)^4 / (1)^2 * (1)^4. Wait, wait, because the denominator is (R2² T2⁴), which is (R2² * T2⁴). So the ratio becomes ( (1.5 R2)^2 * (T1)^4 ) / ( R2² * T2^4 ) = ( (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² * T2^4 ) ).

But since T1 = T2, that's (2.25) * (T^4) / (T^4) ) = 2.25. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 is 2.25, which is about 2.25. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25.

Wait, but wait! I'm being told that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Oh, wait, does this affect anything? Because the velocities... Hmm. I must have missed something.

Wait, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. How does that affect the observed wavelength? Because of the Doppler effect. So if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But the question says they measured the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they are the same. Oh, wait, so the observed peak wavelengths are the same.

So the actual emitted wavelengths from each star might be different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same. Hmm.

Wait, because if Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, then its light would be blueshifted. So the observed wavelength would be shorter than the emitted. Conversely, if Star_1 is not moving (radial velocity 0), its observed wavelength is the same as emitted.

But the question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (their observed λ_max) are the same. So we must consider the Doppler shift for each star.

Wait, so each star's emitted λ_max is different, but when observed, they appear the same due to Doppler shift. So let me think.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the emitted wavelength λ_emit by the Doppler effect formula: λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), assuming v_r is much less than c, which it is here.

Wait, wait, actually, another way. The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity towards the observer (if positive, blueshift; negative, redshift).

But since Star_1 has v=0, its observed λ_max is same as emitted. Star_2 has v_r=700 km/s. But the question says that the observed λ_max are same. So:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + 0)/(1 - 0) ) = λ_emit1.

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) ) )

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So, λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Wait, but wait. Because λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * Doppler factor. But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, we have:

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * [ (1 - (v2/c)) / (1 + (v2/c)) ) ]^(1/2 )

Wait, since v2 is the radial velocity. If Star_2 is moving away from us, v_r is positive, and that would cause a redshift. But the problem says Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. But the problem doesn't specify direction—does it matter? Well, the magnitude is given, 700 km/s. So let's assume it's moving away (v_r positive), which would cause its observed λ_max to be longer than emitted. But Star_1's λ_obs is same as Star_2's. So Star_2's emitted λ_emit must be shorter than Star_1's emitted λ_emit to compensate.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think.

We know that for Star_1:

λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

For Star_2:

λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ_obs1 = λ_obs2 → λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But since λ_emit is related to T via Wien's Law: λ_emit = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So, λ_emit1 = b / T1, λ_emit2 = b / T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought T1 = T2 because observed λ_max are same. But that was without considering Doppler shift. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should approach it as follows: The observed λ_max of each star is the same, which is the same as λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

But each star's emitted λ_emit depends on their temperature. So, the observed wavelength is the emitted wavelength shifted by their Doppler factors.

So, for Star_1, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But λ_emit1 = b / T1, λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So,

(b / T1) = (b / T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Simplify, cancel b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Then rearrange,

T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

= T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

Hmm. Interesting. So the temperatures are different. Which means my initial assumption that T1 = T2 was wrong because I didn't account for the Doppler shift.

Wait, but the problem says the two stars' observed wavelengths are the same. So, to get the same observed λ_max, their emitted λ_emit are different because their velocities are different.

So, this introduces a temperature difference between the two stars. So now, going back to the luminosity calculation.

The luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

We know R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 * T2^4 )
= (2.25 R2^2 * T1^4 ) / ( R2^2 T2^4 )
= 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

So, we need to find the ratio (T1 / T2)^4.

From earlier, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

So,

(T1 / T2) = sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

So,

(T1 / T2)^4 = [ (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) ]^2

Hmm. Now, v2 is 700 km/s. Let's compute that in terms of c.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 700 km/s is 700 / 3e5 = 7e2 / 3e5 = approx 0.002333... So v2/c ≈ 0.002333.

Then,

(1 - v2/c) ≈ 0.9976667

(1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333

Compute (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ≈ (0.9976667) / (1.002333) = Let's compute:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1.002333. So 0.9976667 / 1.002333 ≈ approx 0.99536.

Wait, wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute (1 - x)/(1+x) where x = 0.002333.

(1 - x)/(1 + x) = (1 - x)^2 / (1 - x^2) ≈ (1 - 2x)/(1 - x²) when x is small. But perhaps a more accurate way is to compute 0.9976667 / 1.002333.

Alternatively, approximate 1.002333 as 1 + 0.002333, and 0.9976667 as 1 - 0.002333.

So,

(1 - x) / (1 + x) = [ (1 - x) ]^2 / (1 - x^2) ) ≈ [1 - 2x ] / (1 - x² )

But perhaps it's easier to compute it directly.

Let me compute 0.9976667 / 1.002333.

Let me compute 0.9976667 ÷ 1.002333.

Well, 1.002333 * 0.995 ≈ 1.002333 * (1 - 0.005) = 1.002333 - 0.005011665 ≈ 0.997321. Hmm, but 0.9976667 is a bit higher than 0.997321.

Wait, what's 1.002333 * 0.9953 = ?

Let me compute 1.002333 * 0.995:

= 1.002333 * (1 - 0.005) = 1.002333 - (1.002333 * 0.005)
= 1.002333 - 0.005011665 = 0.997321335.

But we have 0.9976667 as the numerator. So 0.9976667 / 1.002333 ≈ 0.995 + (0.000345) / 1.002333.

Wait, 0.9976667 - 0.997321335 = 0.000345365.

So, 0.000345365 / 1.002333 ≈ approx 0.0003446.

So, total is approx 0.995 + 0.0003446 = 0.9953446.

So (1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 0.9953446.

Then,

( (1 - x)/(1+x) )^2 = (approx 0.9953446)^2 ≈ ?

0.9953446^2 = (1 - 0.0046554 )^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.0046554 + (0.0046554)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.0093108 + 0.0000216 ≈ approx 0.99071.

Wait, but calculating 0.9953446 * 0.9953446:

Let me compute 0.9953 * 0.9953.

Compute 9953 * 9953.

Wait, perhaps a better way: (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

Let a = 10000, but perhaps an easier approach is to compute 0.995^2.

Wait, 0.995^2 is 0.990025.

But 0.9953446 is a bit higher than 0.995, so its square would be a bit higher than 0.990025.

Hmm, perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation.

Well, (0.9953446)^2 = (0.995 + 0.0003446)^2 = (0.995)^2 + 2*(0.995)*(0.0003446) + (0.0003446)^2.

Compute each term:

0.995^2 = 0.990025.

2 * 0.995 * 0.0003446 = 2*0.995 * 0.0003446 ≈ 1.99 * 0.0003446 ≈ 0.0006846.

(0.0003446)^2 ≈ ~1.187e-7.

Adding them up: 0.990025 + 0.0006846 ≈ 0.9907096. Plus the tiny term is negligible.

So, approximately 0.9907.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 -x)/(1+x) ]^2 ≈ 0.9907.

Thus, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ let's compute:

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

But 0.9907 is 0.99 + 0.0007. So,

2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 = 0.001575.

So total is 2.2275 + 0.001575 ≈ 2.229075.

Wait, approximately 2.229.

But wait, I think I might have made a miscalculation earlier. Because the Doppler effect causes the observed wavelength to change, but perhaps the temperature is T2 observed? Or do I need to correct for the Doppler effect in another way?

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let's think about the actual emitted wavelengths and the temperatures.

The observed wavelength λ_obs is same for both stars. According to Wien's Law, λ_obs = b / T_obs, where T_obs is the observed temperature. But wait, no, the observed temperature would be different because of Doppler shift. Alternatively, perhaps the real temperature (T) is for the star's rest frame, and the observed wavelength is shifted.

Hmm, maybe another approach: The observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So, for each star, their observed λ_max is λ_obs.

But λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) for Star_2, since it's moving away. For Star_1, v=0, so λ_obs = λ_emit1.

So,

λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

λ_emit2 = λ_obs / sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

= λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But since each λ_emit is related to temperature by λ = b / T, so T = b / λ.

So,

T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs.

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / [ λ_obs * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ].

= (b / λ_obs ) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, but this is different from what I had earlier. Because earlier I thought T1 is lower than T2. Hmm.

Wait, let's check: If Star_2 is moving away (v positive), then λ_emit2 is shorter than λ_emit1 (since it's blueshifted in emission).

Wait, no, if the star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer. So λ_obs = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, no, the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v/c) [approximate when v << c].

But the exact formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When the source is moving away (v positive), the observed wavelength is longer than emitted (redshift). So, for Star_2, which is moving away, λ_obs = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

But Star_1 is not moving, so λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Thus,

λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

But λ_emit = b / T, so,

b / T2 = (b / T1) * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T2 = (1/T1) * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

→ T2 = T1 / sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

→ T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Wait, earlier I thought it was T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) )

But according to this, that's correct.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about the Doppler shift part. Let me perhaps double-check.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

But this is when the source is moving away (v positive). So, for Star_2, which has v=700 km/s, it's moving away. So its observed wavelength is longer than emitted.

For Star_1, which is at rest, λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

So, since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2,

λ_emit1 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Which is the same as before.

So, considering T1 and T2:

λ_emit1 = b / T1.

λ_emit2 = b / T2.

So, substituting into the equation,

b/T1 = (b/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

Cancel b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )

→ T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Which is the same as earlier.

So, T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) )

Thus, T1 is less than T2 because (1 - v/c) is less than (1 + v/c), so the sqrt makes it even smaller.

So, T1 is smaller than T2.

Wait, that's different from the initial assumption where I thought T1 and T2 were same. So that's where I went wrong earlier. I didn't account for the Doppler shift.

So now, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * ( T1 / T2 )^4 )

Because L is proportional to R^2 T^4.

Wait, earlier calculation had R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So,

(L1/L2) = (1.5)^2 * (T1 / T2)^4

= 2.25 * (T1 / T2)^4

Hmm, so we need to compute (T1/T2)^4.

From earlier,

(T1 / T2) = sqrt( (1 - v2/c) / (1 + v2/c) )

= sqrt( (1 - (v2/c)) / (1 + (v2/c)) )

Which is sqrt( (1 - x)/(1 + x) ), where x = 700e3 / 3e5 = 700/300,000 = 0.0023333.

So, x ≈ 0.002333.

Compute (1 - x) = 0.9976667.

(1 + x) = 1.0023333.

So,

(1 - x)/(1 + x) ≈ 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ approximately 0.9953446.

Then,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.9953446)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, because (sqrt(a))^4 is a squared. So,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.9953446)^2 ≈ 0.9907.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ let me compute that.

2.25 * 0.99 is 2.2275.

2.25 * 0.0007 is 0.001575.

Adding them, 2.2275 + 0.001575 = 2.229075.

So, approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25 → 2.25.

B) ~2.32 → 2.32.

C) ~2.35 → 2.35.

D) ~2.23 → 2.23.

Wait, 2.229 is approximately 2.23, which is option D. So the factor is approximately 2.23.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation because when I think about (1 - x)/(1 + x) with x=0.002333, I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1 - x)/(1 + x) again with x = 0.002333.

(1 - 0.002333) = 0.997667.

(1 + 0.002333) = 1.002333.

Compute 0.997667 / 1.002333.

Let me compute this as 0.997667 ÷ 1.002333.

Using a calculator approach:

1.002333 ≈ 1.002333.

0.997667 ÷ 1.002333 ≈ 0.995347.

Wait, 1.002333 * 0.995347 = ?

= (1 + 0.002333) * (1 - 0.004653)

= 1*(1) + 1*(-0.004653) + 0.002333*(1) + 0.002333*(-0.004653)

= 1 - 0.004653 + 0.002333 - (0.002333 * 0.004653)

≈ 1 - 0.00232 + approx 0.0000109.

So total approx 0.99767.

Which is close to 0.997667.

So, 0.995347 is a better approximation for (1-x)/(1+x).

So,

(T1/T2) = sqrt( 0.995347 ) ≈ approximately 0.99767.

Because sqrt(0.995347) ≈ Let's compute it.

Compute sqrt(0.995347):

We know that sqrt(0.99) is about 0.99499, sqrt(0.995) ≈ 0.997499.

0.995347 is a bit higher than 0.995, so sqrt should be a bit higher than 0.9975.

Let me compute 0.99767^2.

0.99767 * 0.99767 = (1 - 0.00233)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00233 + 0.00233^2 ≈ 0.99534 - 0.0000054289 = 0.995334571.

Which is close to 0.995347. So, sqrt(0.995347)≈0.99767.

So,

(T1/T2) ≈ 0.99767.

Thus,

(T1/T2)^4 = (0.99767)^4.

Compute (0.99767)^2 = 0.995347.

Then, (0.995347)^2 = ?

Again, 0.995347^2: Let me compute 0.995347 * 0.995347.

= (1 - 0.004653)^2 = 1 - 2*0.004653 + (0.004653)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.009306 + 0.00002165 ≈ 0.99071565.

So,

(T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.990716.

Thus,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990716 ≈ 2.25 * 0.990716 = ?

Compute 2.25 * 0.990716:

= 2 * 0.990716 = 1.981432

0.25 * 0.990716 = 0.247679

Add: 1.981432 + 0.247679 ≈ 2.229111.

So, approximately 2.2291.

Which is about 2.23, so option D.

Wait, but why does the radial velocity of Star_2 affect the temperature? Because when the star is moving away, its light is redshifted, making the observed wavelength longer. To have the same observed wavelength as Star_1, the emitted wavelength must be shorter, which implies higher temperature (since λ is inversely proportional to T). So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Wait, no, wait. Because if Star_2 is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So to have the same observed wavelength as Star_1 (which is not moving), Star_2's emitted wavelength must be shorter. Since λ_emit is shorter, T is higher (since λ = b/T). So, T2 > T1.

Which matches our earlier calculation where T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1-x)/(1+x) ), with x positive. So, (1-x)/(1+x) < 1, so sqrt of that is less than 1. So T1 < T2.

So, Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Now, since L is proportional to R^2 T^4, and R1 is 1.5 R2, T1 is less than T2.

So, the luminosity ratio is 2.25 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) = 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4.

As we computed, this is approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23.

So, the correct answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2, we use the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the radii
The problem states that the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2} = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Relating the temperatures
The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, meaning their observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are equal. Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]

For Star_1, which has a radial velocity of 0, the observed wavelength is the same as the emitted wavelength:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,1}}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the observed wavelength is:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate the two:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + v_2/c}{1 - v_2/c}}
\]

Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{emit}} \propto 1/T \)), we relate the emitted wavelengths to the temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - v_2/c}{1 + v_2/c}}
\]

The speed of light \( c \) is \( 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \), so:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.002333}{1 + 0.002333}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.997667}{1.002333}} \approx \sqrt{0.995347} \approx 0.99767
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the temperature ratio to the fourth power
The luminosity ratio depends on \( (T_1 / T_2)^4 \). First, calculate \( (T_1 / T_2)^4 \):

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = (0.99767)^4
\]

First, compute \( (0.99767)^2 \):

\[
(0.99767)^2 \approx 0.995347
\]

Then, square this result:

\[
(0.995347)^2 \approx 0.99071
\]

Thus:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 0.99071
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the luminosity ratio
Substitute into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 0.99071 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 5: Comparing with the options
The closest option to \( 2.229 \) is:

**D) ~2.23**

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
