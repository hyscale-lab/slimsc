Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the problem states that the state |α> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. That means they're the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. So, the state can be written as |α> = a(1+i)|up> + a(2-i)|down>, where a is the proportionality constant. I'll need to find a first because the state must be normalized.

To normalize, the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients should be 1. So, the coefficient of |up> is (1+i), so its magnitude squared is (1^2 +1^2) = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2-i), so magnitude squared is (2^2 + (-1)^2) =4 +1=5. So, total is 2 +5=7. So a^2 *7 =1 → a=1/sqrt(7). So, |α> = (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, the operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The matrix elements are Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, what's this matrix look like? For a 2x2 matrix, since the particle is spin-½, the matrix will be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the spin-½ case, the basis is |up> and |down>. So for i and j each being 1 and 2 (assuming 1 is up, 2 is down), when i≠j, Aij is ħ/2, else 0. So the diagonal elements are zero, and off-diagonal are ħ/2. So the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

So this operator is ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So yes, A = (ħ/2) σ_x.

Wait, but the eigenstates of σ_x are different from |up> and |down>. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So, the operator A has eigenvalues (ħ/2)(1) and (ħ/2)(-1), so (ħ/2 and -ħ/2).

But wait, the question is about measuring the operator A. So the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitude projections onto those eigenstates.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |α> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |−x>, where |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). So, I can write |α> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, and the coefficients' magnitudes squared will be the probabilities.

So, let's express |α> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

First, let's write |α>:

|α> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

We know that:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2),
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2).

Substituting these into |alpha>:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ] + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) [ (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Let me simplify this expression. Factor out 1/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i) (|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Expanding the numerator:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|−x>

Combine like terms:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] |+x> + [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] |−x>

Compute the coefficients:

For |+x>:
(1 + i) + (2 - i) = 3 + (i -i) → 3.

Wait, no. Let me compute it properly.

1 + 2 = 3, i - (-i) → Wait, no, (1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

For |−x>:
(1 +i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i = -1 + 2i.

So the numerator becomes:

3 |+x> + ( -1 + 2i ) |−x>

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)).

Let me factor out sqrt(2) from denominator: sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(14), so:

|alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 +2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is the square of the magnitude of the coefficient of |+x>, and similarly for |−x>.

Coefficient for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14). So probability is (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/(14). Similarly for |−x>, the coefficient is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14.

Wait, let's compute the magnitude squared of (-1+2i).

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5. So the probability is 5/14.

Wait, but 9/14 plus 5/14 is 14/14=1, so that checks out.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571. So the options: looking at the first part, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and has average hbar/7.

Option D says 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn't match.

Wait, but let me calculate the exact fractions:

9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So options A and D have the first two probabilities as 0.64 and 0.36, and other options have different numbers.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

B) 0.54, 0.46, and 3hbar/sqrt(7).

C) 0.28, 0.72, and hbar/sqrt(7).

D) 0.61, 0.29, and 2hbar/sqrt(7).

So among these, only option A has the first two probabilities as 0.64 and 0.36. So perhaps we can proceed.

But wait, let me check the average. The average value of operator A is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is a Hermitian operator, the expectation value can be found as the sum of probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9/14)(1) + (5/14)(-1) ] * (ħ/2 ).

Compute the coefficient: (9 -5)/14 =4/14=2/7. So <A> = (2/7) * ħ/2 = (2/7)(ħ/2) = ħ/7.

So the average is ħ/7, which matches option A's third part.

Wait, but option A says the average is ħ/7. So that's one of the options.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about another approach. Alternatively, compute <A> using the density matrix.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is known, and A is given, calculate <alpha| A |alpha>.

The matrix representation of A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

The state |alpha> is ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) )^T.

So, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Wait, A is a 2x2 matrix:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

So, compute the inner product:

<alpha| A |alpha> = ( ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^*, ( (2 - i)/sqrt(7) )^* ) * A * ( (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ) )

Wait, wait, the vector is column vector, so when you multiply, it's [a*, b*] times A times [a; b].

So, let's compute it.

a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7), so b* = (2 +i)/sqrt(7).

So, [a*, b*] * A * [a; b] = a* * (A_11 a + A_12 b) + b* * (A_21 a + A_22 b )

But A_11=0, A_12=ħ/2, A_21=ħ/2, A_22=0.

So,

= a* ( (0)a + (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a + 0*b )

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a )

Factor out ħ/2:

= (ħ/2)( a* b + b* a )

= (ħ/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

Note that a* b + b* a = 2 Re(a* b).

Compute a* b:

a* is (1-i)/sqrt(7), b is (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

a* b = (1-i)(2 -i) / 7.

Multiply numerator: (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1.

So numerator is 2 -3i -1 = (1 -3i).

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

Then b* a is the complex conjugate of a* b, which is (1 + 3i)/7.

So a* b + b* a = [ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

So, putting it all together:

< A > = (ħ/2) * (2/7) ) = (ħ/2)*(2/7) )= ħ/7.

So yes, the average is ħ/7. So option A's third part is correct.

But wait, let's make sure that when I did the expansion earlier, I considered the correct eigenstates and their probabilities.

Wait, the probabilities I found were 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the options are A) 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

So, the correct answer would be option A.

Looking at the options again:

A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7 → yes, that's what we have.

But wait, let me look again. The question says to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So, the first two parts are 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but wait, the problem statement has the operator whose matrix is given as Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. So the matrix is:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Which is indeed (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the operator's eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So when I compute the expectation, it comes out to ħ/7.

So conclusion: the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, where |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The goal is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by Aij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise, and to find the average value of A.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α>
The state |α> is given as |α> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize, the coefficients must satisfy the condition that the sum of the squared magnitudes equals 1. The magnitudes of the coefficients are:

- For (1+i): |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2.
- For (2-i): |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5.

Thus, the total magnitude squared is 2 + 5 = 7. The normalization factor is therefore \( a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \). The normalized state is:

\[
|α\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}|up\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}|down\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Express |α> in terms of the eigenstates of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of A are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up\rangle + |down\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up\rangle - |down\rangle).
\]

Expressing |α> in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩:

\[
|α\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}}|up\rangle + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}}|down\rangle.
\]

Substituting \( |up\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) \) and \( |down\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle) \), we get:

\[
|α\rangle = \frac{(1+i)}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle + |-x\rangle) + \frac{(2-i)}{\sqrt{7}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+x\rangle - |-x\rangle).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
|α\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle \right].
\]

The coefficients of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \), respectively.

### Step 3: Calculate probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩ are the squared magnitudes of their coefficients:

- For |+x⟩: \( \left|\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64 \).
- For |-x⟩: \( \left|\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right|^2 = \frac{1+4}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the average value of A
The eigenvalues of A are \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \). The expectation value of A is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{9}{14}\right)\frac{\hbar}{2} + \left(\frac{5}{14}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(\frac{9}{14} - \frac{5}{14}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36 and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
