Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and there are three reactions happening. I need to figure out the structure based on the NMR, then see what each reaction does, and finally determine the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me think about what each part could mean.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a region where aldehyde protons appear. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the compound. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like from a ketone, but more likely an aldehyde.

Looking at the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks. Both are doublets, each integrating to 2H. These are probably aromatic protons on a benzene ring. If they're doublets and coupled, maybe they are part of a para-substituted ring. Wait, let me think. In a para-substituted benzene, the protons are usually split into two doublets, each of 2H. Because each proton is next to two equivalent protons on the adjacent carbons. Wait, noâ€”para substitution would have each proton's neighboring H being equivalent. So for instance, if you have a para-substituted phenol, the two protons adjacent to the substituent (like -OH) would be next to each other, but in a para arrangement, each of those two protons would have one on each adjacent carbon, but for coupling, maybe they are part of a diad.

Wait, in the case of para-substituted aromatic rings, the protons are usually split into two doublets if there's a substituent that causes coupling. Alternatively, in an ortho substitution, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe these are part of a di-substituted aromatic ring, maybe with substituents in the para positions. Or perhaps it's a substituted benzene where each pair of protons is in a particular arrangement.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad suggests possibly exchange with something else, like an acidic proton. Maybe phenolic OH protons, but they are usually broader and might appear around 5 ppm. Hmm, but wait, sometimes when there are multiple OH groups or when the solution is not perfectly deuterated, they can appear as singlets. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to something else, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the aldehyde is at 9.72.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 ppm could be a double bond. If it's a doublet of some sort, but it's a broad singlet. Maybe it's a pair of protons on a vinyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituents causing the protons to be split, but I'm not quite getting it.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet integrating to 2H. That's around the region for protons adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an alkoxy group. A doublet suggests two neighboring protons. So maybe something like CH2-O, where each hydrogen is adjacent to another CH2 group. Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in a phenolic ether or something else.

Putting this all together, perhaps the molecule has an aldehyde group, a benzene ring, another benzene ring (since the molecular formula is C8H9NO: 8 carbons. Let me count. Aldehyde (1 C), two benzene rings (each 6 C, but wait, 6*2=12, which is way more than 8. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of unsaturation: each degree is a ring or a double bond. For C8H9NO: formula is C8H9NO. Let's compute degrees of unsaturation.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0.

So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Which could be: aldehyde (a double bond, so 1), two benzene rings each having 3 DoU, but wait, two benzene rings would contribute 6 DoU (each ring is 3 DoU: 3 double bonds). Plus the aldehyde is another, so 7. That's too much.

Wait, perhaps it's not two benzene rings. Wait, maybe it's a single benzene ring and another ring, or maybe some double bonds. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring, an aldehyde group, and another group with a double bond. Let's go back to the NMR.

The triplet at 9.72 ppm (1H) likely an aldehyde proton. So that's one DoU.

The aromatic protons at 6.98 and 6.51: perhaps a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but each substituent could have a different effect. Alternatively, maybe each of those is a pair of protons on a single benzene ring, which is substituted in such a way that each pair is a doublet.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could be a diphenyl compound. Like two benzene rings attached to a chain. Let's consider that.

Looking at the molecular formula, C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. For example, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the reactions. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: that's a nitrous acid condition, typically used for diazotization of aromatic amines. So the first step is probably converting an aromatic amine to a diazonium salt.

But wait, the starting compound is C8H9NO. So if it's an aromatic amine, maybe it's a primary amine attached to a benzene ring. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. If it's an aniline derivative, perhaps with some substituents.

Wait, the initial compound has a N in the formula. So perhaps it's an aromatic amine, but then after reaction with NaNO2 and HCl, it forms a diazonium chloride. Then, next step is H2O (maybe a hydrolysis?), and then aq. KOH with heat.

Wait, but let's think about the reactions. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions depending on the conditions. In aqueous acid, they can decompose to form phenols (if it's an aryl diazonium salt). However, if the diazonium is treated with aqueous KOH and heat, it could undergo a coupling reaction or perhaps a dehydration.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the starting structure. If after the first reaction with NaNO2 and HCl, the amine is converted to diazonium chloride, and then in H2O, it would typically undergo hydrolysis to produce a phenol. But perhaps in this case, the diazonium is in a position that, upon hydrolysis, releases something else.

Alternatively, maybe the structure has a meta-directing group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is not diazotization. Wait, but NaNO2 and HCl are typically for that purpose. So perhaps the starting compound has an aromatic amine group.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: aniline is C6H7N. So if the starting molecule is an aniline derivative with two more carbons and some O-containing groups. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. So if it's an aniline with some substituents, maybe a substituent that includes an oxygen, like an ether or a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting compound is a benzylamine derivative. Let me think.

But perhaps I should focus more on the NMR data.

So, the NMR has:

- 1H at 9.72 (triplet). Could be aldehyde. Then
