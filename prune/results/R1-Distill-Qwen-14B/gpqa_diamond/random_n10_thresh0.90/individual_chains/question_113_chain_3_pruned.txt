Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound using the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. So that makes me think the compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol. Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid because those can also have broad O-H stretches. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, but no, ethers don't have O-H groups. So, the presence of O-H suggests either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Let's think about what those could be. The peak at 1700 is often due to carbonyl groups (C=O). So, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. Sometimes, that's indicative of conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring with substitution. Wait, another possibility is an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, which can lower the carbonyl stretching frequency a bit because of conjugation. So, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone or something similar.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, right? So the compound probably has a double bond, possibly conjugated with the carbonyl group. That would fit with the IR data of a peak at 1650, which I think is the conjugated double bond's C=C stretching.

Then, the Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. What's a fragment that would give m/z 45? Let's think about common fragments. For example, the methyl group is 15, but that's too low. Ethyl is 29, but 45... Hmm. Maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O, but that would be for something like ethylene oxide. Alternatively, maybe a CO fragment. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 45 (12*2 + 1*6 +16= 24+6+16=46? Wait, no, that's 46. Oh wait, (CH3)2O is 45? Let me check: 2*(12+3) = 2*15=30, plus 16 for O, makes 46. So that's not it. Another possibility is a CH2CO+ fragment. Wait, the molecular ion of CH2CO would be 43, but 45 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe a (CH3)CO+ group? That would be 58. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. Let's see, what's the molecular weight of each. C6H12O would be 6*12 +12 +16 =72 +12 +16=100. C6H10O is 72+10 +16=98. C6H10O2 is 72 +10 +32=114. C6H12O2 is 72+12 +32=116.

Mass spec usually fragments the molecule. If the base peak is at 45, what could that correspond to? 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (which is 60, no). Wait, maybe it's the loss of something. Or maybe it's a fragment from the molecule. Let's see, 45 is 12*3 +1 +16. So, maybe a fragment like C3H7O? Not sure. Or perhaps a ketene or something else.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula has either one or two oxygen atoms. The IR shows two carbonyl peaks, so maybe two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and another group, like an aromatic ring with substitution.

Wait, let me recap the IR. Broad peak around 3000: O-H stretch. Then peaks at 1700 and 1650. So, two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and another functional group. Wait, 1700 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation or another carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe one of them is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic C=C stretch. Wait, but aromatic C=C is usually around 1450-1600 cm⁻¹. So 1650 is a bit higher, maybe. So perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

So, putting that together, perhaps the compound is an ester with a conjugated double bond. For example, maybe something like methyl acrylate, but larger. Alternatively, a dienone or something else.

Now, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. Let's think about possible structures. If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, or maybe RCOOCH2CH2CH2 etc., but maybe more substituted.

Wait, but what about the molecular formula? The options are C6H10O, C6H10O2, etc.

Let me look at the molecular formulas. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X (halogens) or N.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2.

Degrees = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C6H12O2:

(2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That would mean either one ring plus one double bond, or two double bonds, or one triple bond, etc.

But wait, the IR and NMR suggest multiple double bonds or rings.

Hmm, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so at least one double bond. Let me check each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees=1.

So, the structure must have one ring and one double bond, or two rings, etc. But with a carbonyl group, perhaps.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees = (12*2 +2 -10)/2 = (14 -10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees= (14 -10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees= (14-12)/2=1.

Wait, but the IR shows 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹, which suggests two carbonyl groups? Or perhaps one carbonyl and another conjugated group.

Wait, another approach. The IR peak at 1700 is a strong carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. The peak at 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C, but earlier I thought it's a conjugated carbonyl.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond in the structure. So, maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond, perhaps conjugated.

Wait, the mass spec shows a peak at 45. Hmm, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO (which is 58?), no, wait. Let me think: 45 is 12 + 16 + 17? No. Wait, 45 is 45 atomic mass units. So, possible fragments: for example, (CH2)2O is 44 (but no, that's 44). Alternatively, maybe a fragment like CH2CO, which would have a molecular weight of 43 (12 + 1*2 +12 +16=43). Hmm, maybe not. Or maybe a methyl ester group.

Wait, another possibility: 45 could be the molecular ion of a fragment like C3H7O. Wait, 3 carbons would be C3H7O. Molecular weight: 3*12=36, 7 H is 7, O is 16. Total 36+7+16=59. No, that's not 45.

Wait, perhaps it's a CO group attached to something. CO has a molecular weight of 28. So, 45-28=17. Hmm, 17 would be CH3-. No, 17 is CH2Cl, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)CO- which is 58. No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is C3H3O. 3*12=36, 3 H=3, O=16. 36+3+16=55. No, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H5O. Let's see: 3*12=36, 5 H=5, O=16. 36+5+16=57. No. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's an acylium ion. An acylium ion would have a formula like RCO⁺. For example, CH3CO⁺ would have a mass of 43 (12+16 +12+1=43). But the peak is at 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a fragment like CH2=CHCOO⁺. Wait, that's more than 45. Alternatively, perhaps a smaller fragment.

Wait, perhaps the base peak is from the loss of something. For example, in an ester, the molecule could break into an alcohol and a carbonyl. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the possible structures. Let's consider the options:

Option A: C6H12O2. So, molecular formula is C6H12O2. Possible structures could be an ester with a ring, like a cyclic ester, or maybe a diester. Or perhaps an ester with an alcohol group.

Wait, but the IR showed O-H, so maybe it's an ester with an alcohol? No, that would be a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, an ester with a hydroxyl group. Wait, that's possible. But how?

Alternatively, maybe it's a beta-keto ester. Because beta-keto esters have two carbonyl groups. Let's think: structure like RCO-COR'. So, two carbonyl groups.

If the structure is a beta-keto ester, then the IR would show two carbonyl peaks, which is what we have. The broad peak at 3000 would be from an -OH group, perhaps from an alcohol or another carbonyl.

Wait, but beta-keto esters don't have an O-H group, unless it's a hydroxyl somewhere else.

Hmm, maybe the compound is a diol ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid with an ester group. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H peak, but in that case, the IR would have a peak around 2500-3300 for the O-H, but the question says a very broad peak at 3000, which could fit. But the presence of two carbonyl peaks complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that usually gives a single carbonyl peak.

Wait, another angle: the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond. So perhaps the structure is an enol ester or something with a conjugated double bond adjacent to a carbonyl.

For example, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. In that case, the IR would show a carbonyl at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond would have a peak around 1650. The vinyl hydrogens would appear in the NMR as a triplet or something around 5-6 ppm.

Now, the molecular formula options. Let's think about the degrees of unsaturation again.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation is (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. That could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees=1. So one ring or one double bond plus a ring.

Wait, but if the structure is an ester with a conjugated double bond (so one double bond), then the other degree of unsaturation could come from a ring, but not necessarily. Alternatively, the two carbonyl groups would account for two double bonds, but that might not fit.

Wait, but the presence of two carbonyl peaks in IR suggests two double bonds (each carbonyl is a double bond), but that might require two degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but Option C has two degrees. Let me think about the possible structure for C6H10O2.

If it's an ester with a conjugated double bond and a ring. For example, methyl cyclohexene carboxylate? Or something else.

Alternatively, the structure could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Let's say, CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is something else. But let's see the molecular formula.

Suppose the structure is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2-O-R? No, perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diester, but that might not fit the IR data.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a hexenoyl ester with a ring. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, going back to the mass spec. The fragment at 45. Let's think of possible structures that would lose a group to give 45. For example, the molecular ion could lose a larger fragment, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, the fragment itself could be a small part of the molecule.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula of the compound could be C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. So if a fragment is at 45, that's about 45/114 ≈ 39% of the molecular weight. Maybe it's a cleavage product. For example, cleavage after the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ester with a benzene ring. But the IR doesn't show a strong peak for aromatic C-H stretches, which are usually around 3000 cm⁻¹. Wait, the broad peak at 3000 could be O-H, but aromatic C-H would be around 3050-3100, maybe as a set of peaks.

But the given IR data shows a very broad peak at 3000, but I don't know if it's O-H or aromatic C-H. Wait, O-H is usually broader and could be in that range. Aromatic C-H is usually less broad and more around 3050. But perhaps the compound has both.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted acetate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures. For example, methyl vinyl benzoate? Wait, but the molecular formula would vary.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that there's a double bond. Let's say the structure has a conjugated diene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2 has 6 carbons. Let's think about possible structures with two oxygen atoms.

If it's an ester, the formula would be R-O-CO-R'. Let's say R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So for the ester, the formula would be (R + R') O CO. So the overall formula would have O2.

Wait, for example, if the ester is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, that would be C5H8O2. But our options have C6. Hmm.

Wait, another example: cyclohexene ring with an ester group. Let's say cyclohexene carboxylic acid methyl ester. The formula would be C7H10O2, which is more than our options. So that's not it.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is a vinyl ester, like CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is another group.

Wait, let's calculate for the molecular formula C6H10O2.

Suppose the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OCH3? No, that's more O's. Alternatively, maybe a simpler structure.

Alternatively, think about maleic anhydride, but that's a different formula.

Wait, perhaps it's an orthoester or something else. Alternatively, think about the possibility of a lactone, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a substituted cinnamic acid ester. Let's say, something like CH2=CHCOO-R. For R being an ethyl group, the formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6.

Wait, maybe the ester is methyl vinyl something. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's C6H10O2: 3 carbons in ester group (CH2CH2CH3?), no, wait.

Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is CH2=CHCOO-Et. Let's count: CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons, and Et is 2, so total 5. Hmm, not enough. Wait, perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, maybe it's (CH2)2COOCH2CH2CH3. That would be a propyl ester of butenoic acid. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible molecular formula. C6H10O2 has 6 carbons and 10 hydrogens. Let me calculate the hydrogen deficiency. Degrees of unsaturation is 2, so maybe one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

If the structure has a ring and a double bond, perhaps a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached. Let's say, the ester is on the ring. For example, methyl cyclohexene-1-carboxylate. Let's see, the formula would be C7H10O2. Hmm, that's more than our case. So not matching.

Hmm. Maybe the structure is a substituted acrylic acid ester. For example, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3. That's C6H10O2. Wait, CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons (CH2=CHCOO-), and CH2CH2CH3 would be 3 carbons as well. Wait, CH2=CHCOO- is 3 carbons, and if the R is CH2CH2CH3 (which is actually CH2CH2CH3? That's iso-butyl or something, but wait, CH2CH2CH3 isn't right. Wait, maybe ethyl group. Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. That would be C5H8O2. Hmm, not matching C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OCH3? No, that would have more O's.

Wait, perhaps it's an ester with a six-membered ring. Maybe a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone and would have a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. Let's say, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that would be C6H10O2. Wait, let's count:

CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons (CH2=CH-COO-), and CH2CH2CH3 is 3 carbons. So total 6, but O is 2. Wait, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 is C6H10O2.

Let me see: the ester group is O-CO-O. Wait, no, ester is R-O-CO-R'. So in this case, R' is CH2CH2CH3 (propane? No, wait, that's 3 carbons, so R' is propyl. So the ester would be propyl acrylate, I think. Propyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. The molecular formula is C6H10O2, which matches option C.

Now, checking the spectroscopic data:

IR: O-H? Well, propyl acrylate doesn't have an O-H group. Wait, wait, but the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which suggests an O-H. So this would conflict. Hmm.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the structure doesn't have an O-H group, then the IR wouldn't show a broad peak. So maybe I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a cyclic ester with a double bond. But then, where is the O-H? Unless it's a lactone, which doesn't have an O-H group.

Hmm, back to square one. The presence of O-H suggests that the compound has either an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid group.

Wait, but in the options, the possible formulas include O and O2.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the formula would have O2? For example, if it's a diacid or a monacid with another group.

Wait, the IR peaks: 1700 is a strong carbonyl, which could be a carboxylic acid (but their carbonyl is usually broader and around 1700). Wait, but the 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring or conjugated carbonyl.

But the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a phenyl acetic acid derivative. But the formula would have benzene rings.

Wait, but the molecular formula options don't include benzene, which has 6 carbons. Wait, the options are all C6H... So, maybe the structure includes a benzene ring. Wait, but that's not possible with C6H10O2 because benzene would take 6 carbons, leaving no room for the rest of the structure. Hmm, unless it's a substituted benzene.

Wait, perhaps the compound is methyl benzoate. Let's see: benzoate is O-CO-OCH3. The molecular formula is C6H5COOCH3 → C8H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2, which is less.

Hmm, perhaps it's not a benzene ring.

Wait, another idea: the compound has an ester group and a hydroxyl group. So like an alcohol and an ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2OH. Let's see, the formula would be C6H10O3. But the options don't have O3. So that's not matching.

Wait, but if the compound is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a beta-diketone, but that would have two carbonyl groups. But does that fit the NMR data?

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. Beta-diketones don't have double bonds, but maybe it's a beta,gamma-unsaturated diketone. But again, the O-H would have to come from somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituted maleic acid derivative. Maleic acid has two double bonds and two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure about the formula.

Wait, let's try to approach the problem differently. Let's look at the mass spec peak at m/z=45. What's a common fragment with 45? Looking up, I remember that sometimes the (CH3)2CO+ ion (acetone ion) has a mass of 58. Not 45. Wait, perhaps it's the propyl group? No, propyl is 42 (CH2CH2CH3 is 42). Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from the loss of a larger group. For example, if the molecular ion is something like RCO-O-R', the molecule could lose R' to form RCO-O- as a fragment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the molecular formula options: let's compute the possible molecular weight.

Option A: C6H12O2 → (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O → 72
