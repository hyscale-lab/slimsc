Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has two reaction steps, and I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

First, looking at the first reaction:
Butan-2-one (which is another name for methyl isopropyl ketone?) No, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Right, so it's a ketone. It's reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, what's the product here? The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the same carbon. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The butanenitrile part would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, but butane is four carbons. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the nitrile group on the first carbon. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but the key point is that it's a substitution reaction.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you have a ketone reacting with a cyanide, like NaCN, under certain conditions, it typically undergoes a nucleophilic addition. So the NaCN would act as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. But wait, in ketones, which are not as reactive as aldehydes, the nucleophilic addition might require some activation.

So the reaction is: ketone + NaCN in presence of an acid catalyst. Because for nucleophilic addition to ketones, you often need an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic.

So the first step is the addition of CN- to the ketone. But what happens after that? Let's think about the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So that suggests that the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached.

Wait, so maybe after the addition of CN-, the intermediate
