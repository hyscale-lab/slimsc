Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8+2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-10)/2= 8/2=4. So four degrees. That could be two rings and one double bond, or one ring and two double bonds, or four double bonds? Well, probably a benzene ring (which is three degrees) plus another double bond or ring. 

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. A triplet around 9.7 sounds like an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group? Or perhaps it's a conjugated system. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and split based on adjacent groups. Let's see, but if it's a triplet, maybe it's split by two equivalent protons, like adjacent to a CH2 group. So maybe the structure has a CH2 adjacent to the aldehyde.

Then 6.98 ppm, doublet with 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. The doublet suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. Maybe para-substituted benzene? No, wait, para substitution would give two doublets but perhaps in a coupling pattern. Alternatively, maybe an ortho coupling. Or perhaps in a di-substituted benzene. 

6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. So maybe two different sets of aromatic protons. So perhaps two substituents on the benzene ring. Let me think about coupling in para positions. Wait, a para-substituted benzene would have two sets of doublets. If the substituents are in the para positions, each substituent would have a doublet for the adjacent protons. Wait, no, para substitution would have each substituent's protons being equivalent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Next, 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe some coupling but perhaps exchange with something else, like an OH group. Wait, but the integration is 2H. Broad singlet for two protons. Maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen or something. Alternatively, perhaps some kind of conjugation or maybe it's part of an enol form. Hmm, not sure yet.

Then 3.66 ppm, a doublet, 2H. That's a CH2 group. The doublet suggests coupling with another CH2 group or maybe a neighboring group. The chemical shift is around 3.6, which is typical for CH2 next to an oxygen, like OCH2 or CH2O. 

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let's think of a possible structure. 

The aldehyde is at 9.72, so maybe that's part of a larger chain. The 3.66 ppm might be a CH2 connected to an oxygen. Let's imagine a structure like phenyl-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't account for all the carbons. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So let's count the atoms: 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen. 

Wait, maybe the structure has a benzene ring, a substituent that includes the aldehyde and an oxygen. Let's think about a benzaldehyde with some substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acetophenone? No, but acetophenone would have a ketone, not an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's a chain containing an aldehyde and an oxygen, like a hydroxyl or ether group.

Wait, the NMR shows a broad singlet at 6.27 (2H), which could be a pair of protons that are either in a conjugated system or perhaps part of a di-substituted benzene with substituents that cause them to be equivalent. Maybe the compound has two phenyl groups attached to a chain that includes an aldehyde.

Wait, the given options include diphenyl compounds, like options A and B have 'bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)' groups. So maybe the starting compound is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde and some other substituents.

Looking back at the reagents: the compound is reacted with NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, then aqueous KOH and heat.

Wait, NaNO2 and HCl are used in diazotization. So that's usually for aromatic amines or alcohols. Wait, but for phenol groups, you need strong acidic conditions. So perhaps the starting compound has a phenol group that gets converted into a diazonium salt.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So if there's a phenol group, that would be a hydroxyl. So that would be the O in the formula. The N comes from the diazonium salt?

Wait, but the initial compound's formula is C8H9NO. Let's see: benzene ring (6 C, 5 H if substituted), plus maybe a substituent with two more C, one N, one O. Hmm, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CHO group (CHO is O and comes from the aldehyde). So 6 C (benzene) plus 2 C (CH2CHO) gives 8 C. Let's check H: benzene has 5 H if mono-substituted.
