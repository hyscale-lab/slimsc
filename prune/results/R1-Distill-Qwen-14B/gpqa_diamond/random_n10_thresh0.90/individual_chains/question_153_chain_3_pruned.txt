Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael reaction, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what each part is asking.

The problem is about three different Michael addition reactions, labeled (A), (B), and (C). Each involves different reactants, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then, I have to match them with the options given, which are options A to D.

First, I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile (enolate) on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor). So, in this case, I think the nucleophile would be the enolate of dimethyl malonate. Let me think about the structure of the reactants.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH2, right? So its structure is CH2(COOCH3)2. When deprotonated by a base like NaOEt, it forms an enolate. The enolate would have the negative charge on the central carbon, making it a good nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw that structure. The acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but wait, the E configuration. So, the substituents on either end of the double bond are in opposite positions. The group is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, in methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, it's CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-p-tolyl? Or maybe wait, the structure is CH2CH2 with a substituent. Let me get it right.

Actually, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. Wait, no, the numbering. Let me think: CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 is the structure of methyl acrylate. But for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, wait. The acrylate group is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the substituent would be on the third carbon? Or maybe the third position is the one adjacent to the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about it as (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylic acid methyl ester. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. But wait, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So, the structure would be CH2-C(=O)-OCH3. No, wait, no. Let me clarify.
