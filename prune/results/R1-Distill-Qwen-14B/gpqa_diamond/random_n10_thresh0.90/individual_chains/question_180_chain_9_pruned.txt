Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, which is twice the elementary charge. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything related to motion. 

So, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, so I'll probably calculate and then match.

Hmm, wait. The system's energyâ€”since all charges are fixed except maybe the arrangement. But wait, the 12 charges are constrained at 2 meters from P. So the 13th is fixed, and the others are arranged in a sphere or something. So the configuration is 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2 meters around the 13th.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the 12 charges all at 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed? So the 12 are equally spaced around P at radius 2 m. So the potential energy of the system would be due to all the interactions between the charges.

But wait, because the system is isolated, we're considering the electrostatic potential energy. Since each charge interacts with every other charge, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, so maybe we can think of each of the 12 other charges interacting with the 13th and with each other.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy for a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies between each pair. So for 13 charges, the total potential energy U is the sum of U for each pair.

But since the 13th is fixed, perhaps we can separate the contributions. Let's see.

Each of the 12 charges at 2m from P (the 13th charge) will have a potential energy due to their interaction with the 13th charge and with each other.

So the total potential energy would be the sum of:

1. The potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge.
2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but wait, the 12 charges are constrained to be at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P. So the distance between any two of them would be the distance between two points on the sphere, which depends on the angle between them. But wait, if all 12 are identical and symmetrically placed, perhaps they form a regular icosahedron or something, but maybe the exact arrangement isn't necessary because the problem asks for the minimum energy. Hmm, wait, but in that case, the potential energy between the 12 charges would be based on their mutual distances.

Wait, but wait a minute. The problem states that the system is isolated. Are we considering all interactions, including between the 12 charges themselves?

I think so, because in electrostatics, the potential
