Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. So, perhaps the ratio of the populations for the excited state to the ground state is different between the two stars.

Wait, but wait. The question states that the energy difference between the considered levels is known. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state would depend on their respective temperatures.

Wait, but how does the excitation relate to the temperatures? Let me think. If star_1 has twice as excited atoms, that means more atoms are in the higher energy level compared to star_2. So, for star_1, the population ratio (n_i/n_j) is higher. So, according to the Boltzmann equation, that ratio depends on temperature and the energy difference.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is the same for both stars because it's a specific transition, right? So ΔE = E_i - E_j. So, for star_1, (n_i/n_j)_1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) )

Similarly, for star_2, (n_i/n_j)_2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

The question states that (n_i)_1 = 2*(n_i)_2. Assuming that the statistical weights g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (since they're the same element and transition), so the ratio would be (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2*(n_i/n_j)_2.

So substituting from the Boltzmann equations:

(g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

The g_i/g_j terms cancel out on both sides, so we have:

exp( -ΔE/(k T_1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T_2) )

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Taking ln:

-ΔE/(k T_1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T_2) ]

Rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T_1) + ΔE/(k T_2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_2) - 1/(T_1) ] = ln(2 )

Hmm. Let me write this as:

[ (T_1 - T_2) ] / (T_1 T_2) ) * ΔE/(k) = ln(2 )

Wait, wait, let me double-check the algebra. Let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1.

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So the equation becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Hmm, but looking at the options provided, let me see:

The options are:

A) ln(2) = [T2/T1]

B) ln(2) = (T1 + T2)/(T1 T2)

C) ln(2)= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)^2

D) ln(2)= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, but in my equation, I have (T1 - T2) multiplied by ΔE/(k), and that product equals ln(2) multiplied by (T1 T2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express the equation.

We have:

(ΔE / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So, the equation is:

(ΔE/(k)) * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ] = ln(2)

But none of the options have a ΔE or k in them. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I miss something?

Wait, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Wait a second, 1.38e-23 is very close to k (Boltzmann's constant) which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, so if ΔE = k * something?

Wait, let me compute ΔE. The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k = 1.38e-23 J/K). Oh, interesting! So ΔE = k.

So substituting back into the equation:

(k) * [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ] / k = ln(2)

Because ΔE is k, so (ΔE/k) is 1.

So the equation simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann distribution is applied under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which relates the relative populations of two energy levels to temperature and energy difference:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratio is given as \((n_i/n_j)_1 = 2 \cdot (n_i/n_j)_2\). Substituting the Boltzmann equations for both stars and canceling the statistical weights (\(g_i/g_j\)), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) to \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of \(k\), the equation simplifies further to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
