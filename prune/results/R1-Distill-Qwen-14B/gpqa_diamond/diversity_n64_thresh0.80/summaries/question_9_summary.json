Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Triisopropyl Borate**: This molecule has a trigonal planar geometry around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups. It possesses a three-fold rotational axis (C\u2083) and three vertical mirror planes (C\u2083v symmetry). However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane, so it does not exhibit C\u2083h symmetry.\n\n2. **Quinuclidine**: Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound with a three-fold rotational axis and multiple mirror planes. Its symmetry is **D\u2083h**, which includes all the elements of C\u2083h plus additional symmetry elements (e.g., inversion). Since D\u2083h is a higher symmetry group than C\u2083h, quinuclidine does not have C\u2083h symmetry.\n\n3. **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**: This molecule is a fused ring system with ketone groups. Its structure is symmetric, but the arrangement of substituents does not align with the requirements for C\u2083h symmetry. It likely belongs to a different point group.\n\n4. **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**: This molecule has three phenyl groups attached to a trifuran core. The phenyl groups are arranged symmetrically, creating a three-fold rotational axis (C\u2083). Additionally, the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane (\u03c3h), making it consistent with **C\u2083h** symmetry.\n\nBased on this analysis, the molecule that exhibits C\u2083h symmetry is **triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**.\n\nAnswer: A"
