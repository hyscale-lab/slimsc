Okay, let's see. I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the formula they're giving is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if something is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

Wait, right, the formula I know is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, maybe it's plx = 1/(distance in parsecs). So distance d = 1/(plx). That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Like, nearby stars have larger parallax values because their position shifts more in the sky as Earth orbits the Sun.

Now, the question is about how the number of stars (N) changes with distance. So, I need to relate N to distance (r, which I'll assume is the same as d) and find out the dependence.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. So plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So plx^5 = (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. Therefore, 1/(plx)^5 is d^5.

So substituting back into N, N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question asks how N changes with distance per unit range. Hmm. So per unit distance, how does N relate to r?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. So N = k/(plx)^5, where k is some constant.

But since plx is 1/d, substitute that in: N = k/( (1/d) )^5 ) = k * d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh wait, so they probably are asking for the differential, like the change in N with respect to d, or maybe per unit distance. Or perhaps they're asking for the density, like the number per unit volume.

Wait, maybe I should
