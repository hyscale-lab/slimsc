Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' or 'plx', right? So the formula they're giving is Number ∝ 1 / plx^5. 

I remember that parallax (p) is inversely related to distance. The formula is p = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. 

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I need to express the number of stars as a function of distance and then find how it scales with r (distance).

Alright, let's break this down. Since the number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 

(1/(1/d))^5 is same as (d)^5, so N ∝ d^5. Oh wait, wait. Wait, 1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So it's the rate of change, like dN/dr. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5d^4. But the options are in terms of r, not d. Oh, I think I can assume that 'r' here is the distance, so r is the same as d. So dN/dr is proportional to r^4. 

Wait, but the options are about how N changes with distance. Oh, wait no, the question says, "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps it's looking for how the number of stars varies with r. Because if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases with r^5. But the options don't have r^5 as the rate, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, wait, let me read the question again: "How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit r, how does N change? So it's the derivative, d
