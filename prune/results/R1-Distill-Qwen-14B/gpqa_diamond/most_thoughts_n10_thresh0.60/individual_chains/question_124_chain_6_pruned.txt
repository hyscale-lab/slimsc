Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of relativity concepts. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about particles being collided in a detector and how much of them reach the inner walls. The setup says that currently, with a Lorentz factor of about 20, only one third of the particles reach the walls. Now, they want to find the Lorentz factor needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls instead.

Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction. Oh wait, but in this case, the detector's radius is 30 meters. So the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, and the distance they need to travel is fixed. But why does the fraction reaching the walls change with gamma?

Oh, right! The lifetime of the particles would affect how far they can travel before decaying. If the lifetime is longer (higher gamma), they can travel further. So, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, and the observed lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times longer.

Wait, so the particles are 'fast-decaying.' So their decay time is short, but in our frame, it's longer because of gamma. So the time they have to travel is gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime. 

The detector has a radius R = 30 meters. So the particles need to reach the wall, which is at a distance R from the center. The time they have to reach the wall is the time before they decay, which is gamma * tau (tau being the proper lifetime).

The speed is near the speed of light. Let's approximate it as speed v â‰ˆ c. So the time they have is t = gamma * tau. The distance they can travel is v * t = c * gamma tau.

But the distance to the wall is R, so for a particle to reach the wall, c * gamma tau must be >= R. Or, gamma tau >= R/(c). 

Wait, but in the original scenario, the Lorentz factor is gamma_1 = 20, and one third of the particles reach the wall. That suggests that for those particles, c * gamma_1 tau is less than R? Or greater? Wait, no. If the particles don't reach the wall, that would mean their decay occurs before they get there. So
