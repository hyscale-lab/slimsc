Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps in the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is one of them, right? Let me think... The pp chain starts with protons fusing into deuterons, then those into helium-3. The pp-I branch fuses two helium-3 into helium-4, releasing two protons. The pp-II branch has a helium-3 and a helium-4 fusing, but I think that's less dominant. Then the pp-III branch is when three helium-4 nuclei come together, but that's only a minor part, I think.

Wait, the question says the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. So, what neutrinos are produced in the pp-III branch? Well, during the fusion processes, neutrinos are emitted. The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8, which comes from the later stages of the proton-proton chain. So the pp-III branch would contribute to this process.

If the pp-III branch stops, that would mean that the production of boron-8 (and thus the subsequent neutrinos) from that branch would stop. But wait, how much does the pp-III branch contribute to the overall neutrino flux? I think the standard model says that the pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing about 86% of the Sun's energy, and the pp-III is a minor part, maybe around 14%. So if pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would drop, but the pp-I and pp-II would still continue.

But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands. Neutrino energies are related to the reaction they come from. The boron-8 neutrinos have higher energies, around 15-20 MeV, I think. But the question is about 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. Those are much lower energies. Hmm, perhaps these are from a different neutrino source.

Wait, the solar neutrino spectrum has different components. The main ones are the boron-8 neutrinos (higher energy) and the CNO cycle neutrinos (lower energy). But I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the CNO cycle is
