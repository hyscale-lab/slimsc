Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax itself. The options are different power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. So as the parallax increases, the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that their distances are spread out uniformly in some way. But wait, how exactly? Are they uniformly distributed in space, or in some other measure like volume? Because that would affect how the number of stars changes with parallax.

Wait, uniform distribution in the sky likely means that in each unit of volume, there's the same number of stars. Or maybe it's uniform in terms of the number per unit distance. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So, in a spherical shell of radius r, the volume is 4πr² dr. The number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πr² dr, where n is the number density.

But since parallax plx is invers
