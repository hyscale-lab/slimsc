Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I remember that IUPAC naming involves numbering the substituents in a way that gives the lowest possible numbers. So the first thing I need to do is figure out the structure based on the description.

The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, meta means each is separated by one carbon, so each substituent is two positions apart. Let me imagine that. So, if one substituent is at position 1, the others would be at 3 and 5. But wait, maybe they're arranged in a triangle? I'm a bit confused about that.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, right, ortho means adjacent. So if the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups would be at positions 2 and 3? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the ring is six-membered. If the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the ortho positions are 2 and 6. So the hydroxyl and dimethylamino are in positions 2 and 6 or vice versa.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Para is opposite, so if the acid is at 1, methoxy is at 4. So the substituents are at 4.

Let me try to sketch this. Let me number the ring from 1 to 6. Let's say position 1 is the carboxylic acid (let's call it COOH). Then, meta to COOH would be positions 3 and 5. Wait, but the other substituents are the aldehyde (CHO), and the cyano (CN). So one of them is at 3 and the other at 5.

Wait, the description says all three are meta to one another. So maybe COOH, CHO, and CN are all at positions that are meta to each other. Hmm, that might not be possible because three substituents would need to each be meta to the others, which in a benzene ring isn't possible unless they're placed in a way that each is two positions apart. Wait
