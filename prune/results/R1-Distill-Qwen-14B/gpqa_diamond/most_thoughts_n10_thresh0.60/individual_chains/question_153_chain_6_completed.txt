Okay, so I've got this Michael addition reactions problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving a Michael addition reaction. I need to figure out the reactants and the major products for each. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for A, B, and C.

First, I'll try to recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile (like an enolate) on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate acts as a nucleophile and attacks the beta position of the Michael acceptor, which is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It's a diester, so in basic conditions, like with NaOEt, it should form an enolate. The enolate would attack the more electrophilic beta position of the acrylate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate structure: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3-position, so the structure would be CH2-CH2 with a p-tolyl group attached? Wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3)-p-tolyl? No, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is on the third carbon? Hmm, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The formula for methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon? Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-p-tolyl? Or is it CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOCH3? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon. Let me number: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. So the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the carbonyl carbon. That can't be right. Hmm, perhaps the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-CH2-COOCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. No, wait, that can't be right either. Or perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a p-tolyl group on C2, and the COOCH3 on C3.

Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3, with a p-tolyl on C3. So the structure would be CH2-CO-OCH3 with the double bond between C2 and C3, and a p-tolyl group on C3. Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally as CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl substituent somewhere else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me focus on the reaction.

In any case, the Michael donor here is dimethyl malonate. Under basic conditions, it would deprotonate to form an enolate. The enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acceptor) at the beta position.

So, when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the product should be a new compound where the malonate enolate adds to the acrylate.

Wait, the acceptor is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 (if I'm getting that structure right). When the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), the addition would happen, and then the oxygen would attack the carbonyl.

Wait, wait. Wait, the enolate is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. So the acceptor is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is perhaps CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the structure is CH2=C-p-tolyl connected to COOCH3.

So, the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which has two methyl groups on the central carbon) would attack the beta position (the CH2 in CH2=C). The attack would form a new carbon-carbon bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acceptor.

Wait, but the enolate is the conjugate base of dimethyl malonate, which is CH2(CO2Me)2. The enolate would be :CH-C(O2Me)2-.

So when the enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor (the CH2 in CH2=C-p-tolyl), the attack would form a new bond. The product would then have the structure where the two parts are connected.

So, the product would be:

The enolate's alpha carbon (from CH2(CO2Me)2-) attacks the CH2 of CH2=C-p-tolyl-COOCH3.

So, the product would be:

COOCH3-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CH(CO2Me)2.

Wait, but the exact structure after addition would need to be considered. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the regiochemistry. The enolate attacks the beta carbon, leading to a new structure where the acceptor's COOCH3 is now connected to the donor's structure.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a new ester. Let me think about the actual product. So, the initial enolate is from dimethyl malonate, which is O=C(CO2Me)2- as a nucleophile. When it attacks the acceptor, the carbonyl group would shift. Wait, perhaps the product is a conjugate addition, so the structure would have the two carbonyl groups from the donor and the substituent from the acceptor.

Wait, perhaps the product would be a trimethyl ester. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at option A: A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate.

Wait, that structure would have three ester groups (trimethyl) on a propane chain, with the p-tolyl group on the second carbon.

Alternatively, in the reaction, the dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOCH3)2) would act as the nucleophile, and the acceptor is CH2=C-p-tolyl-COOCH3.

So when the enolate attacks, the structure would add the CH2(COOCH3)2 group to the CH2 of the acceptor.

Wait, perhaps the product would be CH2(COOCH3)2-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=COOCH3. But that's not right because after the addition, the double bond would shift.

Wait, no. The Michael addition typically forms a new single bond, so the double bond in the acceptor would have the substituent from the donor added to the beta position. So, the product would be:

The donor's enolate attacks the beta (CH2) of the acceptor. So the structure becomes CH2(COOCH3)2-CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the product is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH2(COOCH3)2. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product as the enolate adding to the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the donor (enolate) adds to the beta carbon, which is the CH2 in CH2=C-p-tolyl-COOCH3.

So the product would be:

O

||
COOCH3-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-CH(COOCH3)2

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a new ester where the two donors (malonate) and the acceptor are connected.

Wait, looking at the options, option A for part A is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. So that structure would be O=C(OCH3)2-CCH2-CO(OCH3)-p-tolyl?

Wait, propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have three ester groups on carbons 1,1,3. So the structure would be:

CH2(COOCH3)2-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

Wait, that's a propionyl group with two esters on the first carbon and one on the third, with the p-tolyl in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the product of adding the enolate to the acceptor, leading to three ester groups.

Another approach: when dimethyl malonate reacts with a Michael acceptor like (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the product is a trimethyl ester with the substituents arranged in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps the product is a trimethyl ester where the p-tolyl is on the second carbon of a four-carbon chain, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a six-membered ring? No, that doesn't seem right. 

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl group on the second carbon. So, for example, propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would have the three ester groups on the first and third carbons, with the p-tolyl on the second.

So the structure would be:

O

|
COOCH3-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-COOCH3

But with two ester groups on the same carbon. Hmm, maybe propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate would be O=C(OCH3)2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's butanoic acid derivatives. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C(OCH3)2-C(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO(OCH3).

Wait, but that's getting a bit unclear. Let me move on to reaction B and see if that helps, then maybe come back.

Reaction B: 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+.

Wait, the piperidine is a cyclic amine. 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So the cyclohexene is attached to the piperidine ring at position 1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the cyclohexene. So, the structure is a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene substituent at position 1.

The other reactant is (E)-but-2-enenitrile, which is CH2=CH-CN with the E configuration, meaning the nitrile and another substituent are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but the Michael reaction typically involves enolate attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, but in this case, the nitrile is an electron-deficient group. Wait, but (E)-but-2-enenitrile has the structure NC-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no. But-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2CH2CN? No, I think it's CH2=CHCH2CN. Wait, but the position of the nitrile is on the third carbon. So, but-2-enenitrile would be CH2=CHCH2CN. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CN.

Wait, but the configuration is E. So the substituents on either end of the double bond are on opposite sides. So in this case, the substituents would be CH2CN and CH2 groups.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile attacks the beta position (the CH2 next to the double bond). Wait, but in this case, the piperidine is the nucleophile. Wait, but in the presence of MeOH and H3O+, perhaps the conditions are acidic. So, the piperidine might not be in a basic form. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, the cyclohexene ring might act as a dienophile in a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's not a Michael addition. Wait, but the question says it's a Michael addition, so the piperidine must be acting as a nucleophile. But wait, under acidic conditions, amines can get protonated, making them less nucleophilic. So perhaps the reaction conditions are different.

Wait, maybe the piperidine is deprotonated to form an enamine or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring has an alpha position where the enamine can form, making it a good nucleophile.

Wait, 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine: the cyclohexene is attached to the piperidine. The double bond is between C1 and C2 of the cyclohexene ring. So, perhaps the piperidine has a substituent that can form an enamine. Wait, but piperidine is a six-membered amine; the substituent is a cyclohexene attached at position 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene can form an enamine within the piperidine structure. Wait, enamine formation typically involves a ketone or aldehyde reacting with a secondary amine. But in this case, the cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, so maybe it's a different scenario.

Hmm, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a nucleophile. The (E)-but-2-enenitrile is the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile, which can act as a Michael acceptor. So, the piperidine's enamine (if formed) would attack the beta position of the nitrile.

Wait, but under MeOH and H3O+ (acidic conditions), maybe the piperidine is protonated, making it a weaker nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine acts as a base, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition of the amine to the nitrile's alpha-beta unsaturated system. So the piperidine's nitrogen is the nucleophile, attacking the beta carbon of the nitrile.

So, in (E)-but-2-enenitrile, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CN. Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile is CH2=CH-CH2-CN? Or is it CH2=CH-CH2-CN? Wait, no, but-2-enenitrile would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with the nitrile on carbon 4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, CH2=CH-CH2-CN. So the alpha-beta unsaturated nitrile is CH2=CH-CH2-CN.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CN, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is on the same carbon as the double bond. Wait, but the name but-2-enenitrile suggests that the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the nitrile is on C4. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CN with a double bond between C2 and C3. So, CH2=CH-CH2-CN.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile would attack the beta carbon (CH2 next to the double bond). So, the piperidine's enamine (or the amine itself) attacks the CH2 in CH2=CH-CH2-CN.

Wait, but under acidic conditions, amines can be protonated and thus less nucleophilic. So perhaps the conditions aren't right for a Michael addition here. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple addition, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine is acting as a base, but I'm not certain. 

Wait, another possibility: the piperidine ring has a conjugated double bond, making it a diene, which could undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with the (E)-but-2-enenitrile as a dienophile. But the question says it's a Michael addition, so that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition. The piperidine's nitrogen attacks the beta position of the nitrile. The product would be a new carbon-nitrogen bond formed, adding the piperidine group to the nitrile acceptor.

So, when the piperidine's enamine attacks, the product would have the structure where the piperidine is attached to the CH2 next to the double bond. So the product might be 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, but considering the substitution, perhaps it's 3-(cyclohexenylpiperidinyl)butanenitrile or something similar.

Looking at the options, option B for reaction B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Wait, 2-oxocyclohexyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 2. But where does that come from?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure again.

Wait, the starting material is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. That's a piperidine ring with a cyclohexene substituent attached at position 1. The cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond between C1 and C2.

So, when the Michael addition occurs, the nitrogen in the piperidine would attack the beta position of the (E)-but-2-enenitrile. So, the product would have the piperidine attached to the CH2 group in CH2=CH-CH2-CN.

But wait, after the attack, the double bond would shift, and the nitrile would have a new substituent.

So the product would be CH2=CH-CH(N-piperidinyl-C6H10)-CN. But perhaps the structure is more accurately represented as butanenitrile with a substituent on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Wait, but how would that form?

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of a new ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene ring opens up during the reaction, but that's getting too complicated.

Moving on to reaction C: C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH and H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the question says C + but-3-en-2-one → ..., so C is one of the reactants. Let me look at the options to see what C is.

Looking at the options, for part C, option B's C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Michael addition where the enolate of cyclohexane-1,3-dione attacks but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-CO. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2? No, but wait, but-3-en-2-one would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's (CH2)2-C=O with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3? No, but but-3-en-2-one would have the carbonyl at position 2 and double bond between 3 and 4. Wait, but but has four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So, but-3-en-2-one is CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that's impossible because the carbonyl is at position 2. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be right because the carbonyl is at C2, and the double bond between C3 and C4 would require the structure CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH3. Wait, but that would be pent-3-en-2-one, not but.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-2-one is an impossible structure because but has only four carbons. So maybe it's but-2-en-1-one, which would be CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mistaken, and but-3-en-2-one is actually CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2, but that's not possible with four carbons. Hmm, maybe it's (CH2)COCH2CH2 with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-CH2, but that's not possible. Maybe the correct structure is CH2=C(CO)-CH2-CH3, which is but-3-en-2-one.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one would have the carbonyl at position 2 and the double bond between 3 and 4, but but only has four carbons. So the structure would be CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible because the double bond can't be between 3 and 4 in a four-carbon chain. Perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3, which is but-2-en-1-one, but that's not matching the name given.

I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me focus on the reaction: C reacts with but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O to produce 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

So, the product has a cyclohexane-1,3-dione (so two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3) and a substituent at position 2 which is a 3-oxobutyl group.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3, perhaps.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-one is probably CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3. So the Michael acceptor is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3.

The other reactant is C, which under the reaction conditions (KOH, H2O) likely forms an enolate.

So, the enolate from C would attack the beta position (the CH2) of the but-3-en-2-one.

The product after the Michael addition would be:

The enolate adds to the CH2, so the product would have the structure where the enolate's R group is attached to the CH2, and the double bond shifts to form a new structure.

Wait, but the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3.

So, the substituent would be CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3.

But where does that come from? Let's think: the enolate from C (which is a dione) attacks the but-3-en-2-one.

So, the enolate would attack the CH2 of CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3, leading to a new bond between the enolate's alpha carbon and the CH2, then the double bond would shift, leading to the formation of a new carbonyl group.

So the product would have the structure where the dione (cyclohexane-1,3-dione) is attached via a CH2 to another CH2, which is attached to a ketone (C=O) and a methyl group.

Wait, but in the product, it's 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So the substituent is a butyl group with a ketone at position 3. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3.

So, for that to happen, the enolate from cyclohexane-1,3-dione would attack the CH2 of the but-3-en-2-one, leading to the attachment of the cyclohexane ring to the CH2, and then the double bond would shift to form the new carbonyl.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are KOH and H2O, which are basic conditions, so the enolate would form from the dione.

So, the product would have the dione attached to the CH2 which is connected to another CH2, then C=O, then CH3.

So, the substituent is a butyl group (but-3-en-2-one is CH2=CH-C(O)-CH3). After the addition, the substituent becomes CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH3.

So, the product is 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which matches the given product.

So, C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, because that's the enolate forming the nucleophile.

Looking at the options, in option B, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione. In option D, C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Wait, but the reaction uses KOH and H2O. KOH is a strong base, so it would deprotonate the dione to form an enolate, which then attacks the but-3-en-2-one.

So, the starting material C must be cyclohexane-1,3-dione, because that's the enolate donor. So, the product is as given.

So, for part C, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

Now, going back to the options, let's check each one.

Option A: A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile, C = 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione.

But in our analysis, C is cyclohexane-1,3-dione, not the 2-hydroxy version. So option A's C is incorrect.

Option B: A = same as A, B = same as B, C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione. So this matches our analysis for C. So for option B, C is correct.

Option C: C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione, but let me check the other parts.

Wait, option C has A as trimethyl 3-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,2-tricarboxylate, which may not be correct.

Option D: C is 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which isn't what we concluded.

So, based on this, option B's C is correct. But let me go back to reaction A and B to confirm.

For reaction A, the product is trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which matches option A's A.

But wait, earlier I was a bit stuck on the structure. Let me think again. The product is formed by the addition of dimethyl malonate (the enolate) to the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The product would be a tricarboxylate ester. The structure would have three ester groups: two from the malonate and one from the acrylate. The p-tolyl group would be on the second carbon of the propane chain.

So, the product would be propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate with the p-tolyl on C2. So, trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate, which matches option A's A and option B's A.

So, for reaction A, the product is as given in options A and B.

Now, reaction B: the product is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. Looking at the options, option B's B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile.

But wait, in the reaction, the piperidine attacks the but-2-enenitrile. So, the product would have the piperidine substituent attached to the CH2 group of the nitrile. So, perhaps the product would have the structure where the nitrile is attached to a four-carbon chain, with the piperidine substituent on the third carbon.

Wait, but 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile would have a cyclohexyl group with a ketone at position 2 attached to the third carbon of butanenitrile.

But how would that form? Let me think again. The piperidine is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. The cyclohexene ring is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen. When it attacks the but-2-enenitrile, perhaps the ring opens or forms a new bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition leads to the formation of an amine substituent on the nitrile's carbon chain.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about the structure of the product here. Looking at the options, option B's B is 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile. So, the substituent is a cyclohexyl group with a ketone at position 2 attached to the third carbon of butanenitrile.

Wait, but the starting piperidine is 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine. So, the cyclohexene is attached to the piperidine's nitrogen. When it attacks the nitrile, perhaps the double bond in the cyclohexene is involved in the addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the piperidine's nitrogen attacks the beta carbon of the nitrile, leading to the addition of the ring to that position.

So, the product would have the structure CH2=CH-CH(N-piperidinyl-C6H9)-CN. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a nitrile with a substituent that includes a cyclohexenyl group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress, so perhaps I'll have to go with the options provided. Based on the earlier analysis, option B seems correct for reaction C, and the other options don't fit. So, putting it all together:

Reaction A: trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate (options A and B).
Reaction B: 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile (options A and B).
Reaction C: cyclohexane-1,3-dione (option B).

So, the correct option would be option B, where all three products match.


The question involves analyzing three Michael addition reactions and determining the correct products based on the given options. Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

---

### Reaction A:  
**Reactants:** Dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH.  
- Dimethyl malonate acts as the nucleophile, forming an enolate under basic conditions.  
- The enolate attacks the β-carbon of the α-β unsaturated carbonyl (methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate).  
- The product is a trimethyl ester with three carboxylate groups and a p-tolyl substituent on the second carbon of the propane chain.  
- The product is **trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate**, which matches the description in options A and B.

---

### Reaction B:  
**Reactants:** 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine and (E)-but-2-enenitrile in the presence of MeOH and H3O+.  
- The piperidine acts as the nucleophile, attacking the β-carbon of the α-β unsaturated nitrile ((E)-but-2-enenitrile).  
- The product is a nitrile with a substituent on the third carbon, where the substituent is a cyclohexyl group with a ketone at position 2.  
- The product is **3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile**, which matches the description in options A and B.

---

### Reaction C:  
**Reactants:** C and but-3-en-2-one in the presence of KOH and H2O.  
- The reactant C is identified as cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which forms an enolate under basic conditions.  
- The enolate attacks the β-carbon of but-3-en-2-one, leading to the formation of a product with a cyclohexane-1,3-dione core and a 3-oxobutyl substituent at position 2.  
- The product is **2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione**, which matches the description in option B.

---

### Evaluation of Options:  
- **Option A:** Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which does not match the product of Reaction C.  
- **Option B:** Correct because it lists all three products accurately:  
  - A = trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate  
  - B = 3-(2-oxocyclohexyl)butanenitrile  
  - C = cyclohexane-1,3-dione  
- **Option C:** Incorrect because it lists C as cyclohexane-1,3-dione but provides incorrect structures for A and B.  
- **Option D:** Incorrect because it lists C as 2-hydroxycyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is not the product of Reaction C.

---

**Answer: B**
