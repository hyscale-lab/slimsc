Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. It seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with a liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, so maybe it's a solid at room temp. 

Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, I'm thinking about what that product might be. Maybe something like a salt or an ester?

Substance X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents I know include things like NaOH, KOH, maybe something else. Wait, the problem also mentions that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. That makes me think of something with isotopes, like maybe something with chlorine or another element that has common isotopes.

Let's go back to the reaction. Liquid Y reacting with X. Common reactions between liquids and solids could be between metals and acids. If X is a metal, Y might be an acid. But wait, another possibility is if X is a carbonate reacting with an acid. But let's think more.

The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So, for a molecule, if it's H2O, that's 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and O with 8 protons and 8 neutrons? Wait, no. Wait, the molecule as a whole must have equal protons and neutrons. Let me think: what molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons? Maybe H2O has 2 H (2 protons, 2 neutrons if considering hydrogen as deuterium?) but wait, H2O in general has 2 H (each with 1 p and 0 n in normal cases, but maybe it's D2O here, which would have 2 D each with 1 p and 1 n, so 2 p and 2 n. Then O has 8 p and 8 n (if it's the heavier isotope). So total for H2O: 2*(1p +1n) + 8p +8n = 10p and 10n. So that would fit. Alternatively, maybe it's CO2, but that has 22 protons and 22 neutrons? Let me check: C is 6 p, O is 8 p each. So CO2 has 6 + 2*8 = 22 p. Neutrons: carbon usually has 6 n (since most is C-12), each O has 8 n (O-16). So 6 + 2*8 = 22 n. So that would fit as well. But wait, what's the gas formed when a metal carbonate reacts with an acid? It's CO2, H2O, and a salt. So if W is CO2 or H2O, which would fit.

But if the precipitate G is formed, that suggests a reaction where a solid is formed. If Y is an acid, perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid would produce CO2, water, and a salt. But if X is a carbonate, then Y could be an acid, and the salt would be the precipitate.

Wait, but if X is a heavier isotope, maybe it's a halogen. Let me think, another possibility is if X is a metal with a heavy isotope. For example, Cl has a heavy isotope Cl-35 and Cl-37. But how would that fit?

Wait, another angle. The product of a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. A keto acid is something like a carboxylic acid, right? So if the acid is reacting with X, perhaps in a neutralization reaction. For example, if X is a base like NaOH, the product would be a sodium salt of the acid. For example, if the keto acid is acetic acid (CH3COOH), reacting with NaOH would produce sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. Wait, but sodium acetate has more than two oxygens in the formula (CH3COO^- Na^+), but the product would have 2 oxygen atoms in each acetate ion. So that fits.

So if X is NaOH, which is a common reagent. But wait, the problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope. Na is usually Na-23, and O is O-16. But if X is a heavier isotope, maybe it's something like NaOH where O is O-18, but that's rare. Alternatively, perhaps X is KOH, which is heavier. Wait, KOH is K (about 39), O (16), H (1). But then, if the product has 2 O's, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively
