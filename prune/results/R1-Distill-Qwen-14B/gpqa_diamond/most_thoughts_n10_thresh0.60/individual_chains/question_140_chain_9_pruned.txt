Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit detailed, but I'll take it piece by piece.

First, the problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which I think is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, room temperature is around 298 K (25°C), so 277 K is a little colder, maybe like 4°C. So B is probably a solid at that temperature.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains two atoms of oxygen. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that part yet, but maybe it'll become clearer later.

Substance X uses a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Okay, so X has an isotope that's heavier than the common one. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Oh, wait, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and LiAlH4 are common reagents for reductions. Wait, another thought: perhaps X is something like LiAlH4 or NaBH4? Because those are strong reducing agents.

Looking back, the reaction between X and Y produces a precipitate. Let me think about possible reactions. For instance, if X is NaBH4, and Y is a liquid like water? But wait, NaBH4 reacts with water to produce H2 gas, but I'm not sure. Or maybe Y is something else.

Wait, when sodium borohydride reacts with something, like maybe an acid, but that might produce hydrogen gas. Alternatively, if Y is an alcohol, then NaBH4 would reduce it, but that might not produce gas. Hmm, perhaps Y is another substance.

Wait, let me think about the gas W. Its molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So the gas is probably H2, because H has 0 neutrons and 1 proton, but wait, that doesn't fit. Oh, wait,
