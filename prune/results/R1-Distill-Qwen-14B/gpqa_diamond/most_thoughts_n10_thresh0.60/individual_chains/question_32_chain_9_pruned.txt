Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions, and the energy here refers to the total energy of the nucleus. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, what's the atomic number of Li? Oh right, lithium is Li, atomic number 3. So if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number A is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's Li-6.

So I need to find the total relativistic energy of a Li-6 nucleus moving at 0.96c. The formula for total energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute gamma first. The speed is 0.96c, so v = 0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)
Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216.
So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784.
Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, I think. Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28.
So gamma = 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714? Wait, 1 divided by 0.28. Let me compute that: 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 * 3.5 is 0.98. 0.28 * 3.57 is 3.57 * 0.28 = let's see: 3 *0.28 is 0.84, 0.57 *0.28 is 0.1596. Sum is 0.9996. So yeah, 3.57 gives 0.28 *3.57= 1. So gamma is 3.5714 approximately.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Because 0.28 is 7/25, so 1/0.28 is 25/(7) which is approximately 3.57142857...

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. But wait, I think the mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.941 u, right? Because Li typically has an atomic weight of about 6.941 g/mol. So Li-6 is the most common isotope, so m = 6.941 u.

Wait, what's the exact mass? Let me double-check. Yes, the standard atomic weight of lithium is
