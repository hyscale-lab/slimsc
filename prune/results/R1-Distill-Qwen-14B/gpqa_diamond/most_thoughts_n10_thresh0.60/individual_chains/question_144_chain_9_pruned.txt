Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a meson resonance and figuring out the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And a resonance means it's a particle that doesn't live very long, so it decays quickly. But I'm not super sure about the specifics.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters, so I guess it's a very small distance, which makes sense because these particles decay quickly.

Wait, mean decay distance—oh right, that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying. I think the formula involves the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the mean proper lifetime (tau) multiplied by the velocity (beta c) gives the mean path length (c tau beta). But wait, because tau is the proper lifetime, and the particle is moving, so we have to calculate that correctly.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime tau? I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the width (which is like the uncertainty in energy) is inversely proportional to the lifetime. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / tau. So tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. The width Γ is given in MeV. Wait, 1 GeV is a thousand MeV, so here Γ is 0.32 GeV. Hmm.

So first, let's calculate tau. Gamma is the total decay width, so tau is ħ divided by Γ. But what about the units? Let me think. ħ has units of GeV·s because Planck's constant is in J·s, and 1 GeV is about 1.6e-10 J, but I think for particle physics, it's more convenient to use natural units where ħc is about 197 MeV·fm. But wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the lifetime tau using the formula tau = ħ/(Γ). Let's plug in the numbers.

But wait, to avoid unit confusion, maybe I can convert everything to compatible units. Let's see:

Gamma (Γ) is 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV: 0.32 GeV.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Yes, because ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s, and 1 J = 6.582e24 GeV, so 1.0545718e-34 J·s is 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So tau = ħ / Γ. Let's compute that:

tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau ≈ 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582 / 0.32 times 1e-25, which is 20.5
