Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and calculating its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A, B, C, D with various values.

Wait, mean decay distance... I remember that particles that decay do so after traveling a certain distance. The formula for mean decay length, I think, is related to the particle's lifetime. The general formula is something like L = c * τ * β * γ, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and βγ comes from relativistic effects.

But wait, the particle's lifetime τ is related to its width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, and the uncertainty in energy gives the uncertainty in time, which relates to the lifetime. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ here is given in MeV, and the Planck constant ħ is in units of GeV·s or something. Let me recall the exact relation. The natural line width is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But the units need to be compatible.

Wait, I think τ is approximately ħ divided by the total width Γ. Let's make sure about the units. Planck
