Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles together, like a bar magnet has two ends. But wait, what's the deal with Maxwell's equations in that scenario? 

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws in electromagnetism. Let me think about each one. The first one I remember is Gauss's Law for electric fields. It says that the divergence of E is proportional to the charge density. So that's ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. That equation doesn't involve magnetism directly, so probably not affected here.

The second equation is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which normally says that the divergence of B is zero. So ∇·B = 0. In our world, this implies that there are no isolated magnetic monopoles because the divergence being zero means the field lines don't start or end anywhere. But in this parallel universe, they do have isolated North and South poles. So Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. Instead of zero, the divergence of B would be something else, maybe proportional to the magnetic charge density. So that equation would definitely be different.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of induction. That's about the curl of E being equal to the negative rate of change of B. So ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. I don't think this equation changes because it deals with how changing magnetic fields create electric fields. Even if you have magnetic monopoles, Faraday's Law would still hold in terms of how the fields relate. Unless I'm missing something, maybe this one stays the same.

The fourth equation is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition. That's ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. In this law, H is involved, which relates to the magnetic field. But wait, Ampère's Law in its original form (without Maxwell's addition) relates to the curl of B, but with the addition of the displacement current, it's more about how changing E fields contribute to the magnetic field. But if B's divergence is now non-zero, does that affect Ampère's Law?

Wait, Ampère's Law is about the curl of H being equal to the current plus the displacement current. So if the magnetic monopoles exist, does that change B's behavior? Let me think. If B can have divergence, then perhaps the way H is defined would change, but I'm not sure. Or maybe Ampère's Law would still hold because it's about the curl, not the divergence.

So back to the question: which Maxwell's equations are different in this universe. The first equation (Gauss's Law for E) remains the same. The second equation (Gauss's Law for B) changes because divergence of B is no longer zero. What about the others?

Faraday's Law is about the curl of E and the time derivative of B. Since magnetic monopoles don't affect how changing B fields induce E fields, I think Faraday's Law remains the same. So the third equation is unchanged.

Ampère's Law (the fourth equation) involves the curl of H. If the divergence of B is changed, does that affect Ampère's Law? Hmm. Ampère's Law is ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. H is B minus something... Wait, in the presence of magnetic charges, the B field's divergence isn't zero, but Ampère's Law relates to the curl of H. I think that Ampère's Law would still hold because it's about the curl, not the divergence. So the fourth equation might not change.

Wait, but wait. If there are magnetic monopoles, does that introduce new terms into Ampère's Law? Or maybe not. Let me think again. Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic charges would actually have another term in one of the equations. Oh right, I remember that if magnetic monopoles exist, there's a dual set of Maxwell's equations. So Gauss's Law for B would have a term like rho_m (magnetic charge density), making ∇·B = rho_m. Also, Faraday
