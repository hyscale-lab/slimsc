Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's see, the question has three parts labeled (A), (B), and (C), each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt in EtOH as the conditions. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a strong electron donor. In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (like malonate) will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. 

Wait, the unsaturated carbonyl here is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the substituent is at the 3 position, which is the beta carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the acrylate part? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is more accurately CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the 3-position would be the CH2, so maybe I should think of it as CH2-CH(CO-OCH3)-p-tolyl? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3 with a substituent on the CH2. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl
