Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about calculating the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like calcium, forming a complex.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, stoichiometric probably means that the ratio is 1:1, like one Ca ion to one EDTA molecule. So the complex is CaEDTA²⁻ maybe. And the K for this complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh, wait, that's the formation constant, Kf. Yeah, Kf is the stability constant for the complex.

So the formula for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Right. But in this problem, the solution has only the complex, so I need to find [Ca²+].

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-, then the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But what about the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- in the solution? I think I can assume that all the EDTA is in the form of the complex because the K is so large. Because a large Kf means the complex is very stable, so most of the EDTA and Ca are tied up in the complex.

So, if the complex dissociates a little, but given Kf is very large (like 5e10), the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca²+] should be very low.

Let me write the expression again. Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Since the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-, and assuming x is the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA⁴- that dissociates. Wait, no, because for every mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA⁴-.

Wait, but since the K is so big, the dissociation is minimal. So [Ca²+] and [EDTA⁴-] are both approximately equal to x, which is very small.

So the initial concentration of
