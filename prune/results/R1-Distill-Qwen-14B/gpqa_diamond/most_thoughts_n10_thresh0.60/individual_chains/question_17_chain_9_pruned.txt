Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other reactions affecting the EDTA. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe that doesn't complicate things. The given K value is 5x10^10 for the Ca-EDTA complex. 

I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it binds metal ions like Ca²+ forming a complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a large K, so the complex is very stable.

Wait, but the problem is about finding the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. So if the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, I need to find [Ca²+].

The formula I think I need is the K expression. For the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-, the equilibrium expression is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

But wait, in the solution, the EDTA is mostly in the form of the complex, right? Because the complex is 0.02 M. So initially, I think the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and we can assume that the free EDTA and free Ca²+ are minimal. But wait, because K is so large, the complex should dissociate only a tiny bit. So the [Ca²+] would be small.

Let me define some variables. Let's say the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. Then, [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well because each dissociation gives one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

So plugging into the K expression: K = (0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10. 

So 0.02/(x²) = 5e10.
