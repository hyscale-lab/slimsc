Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the probability that measuring the observable P will give 0. Hmm, I remember from my studies that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, and their eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So the problem must involve finding the eigenvalues of P and then determining the probability of getting 0.

Wait, the state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. The observable P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write down P to visualize it better. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P looks like this:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]
Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

I think the next step is to find the eigenvalues of P. The possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues, right? So I need to solve for the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me set up the matrix (P - λI). It will be:

[-λ   1/√2      0      ]
[1/√2  -λ   1/√2    ]
[0    1/√2   -λ     ]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix... Hmm, this might get a bit complicated because it's a 3x3 matrix. The determinant can be calculated using the rule of Sarrus or expansion by minors. Let me try expanding along the first row.

The determinant would be:

-λ * determinant of the submatrix [[-λ, 1/√2], [1/√2, -λ]] 
- (1/√2) * determinant of [[1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ]]
+ 0 * determinant of something (so that term is zero).

Calculating the first part: -λ * [(-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2)] = -λ [λ² - (1/2)].

The second part: - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = - (1/√2) * [ (-λ /√2 ) ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2) ) = - ( -λ / 2 ) = λ/2.

Wait, let me double-check that. The minor for the second element (1/√2) is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. That submatrix is:
Row 2: [1/√2, 1/√2]
Row 3: [0, -λ]

So the determinant is (1/√2)*(-λ) - (1/√2)*(0) = -λ/√2. So when we take the cofactor for the (1,2) element, which is in the first row, second column, the sign is (-1)^(1+2) = -1. So the term is (1/√2) * (-1) * (-λ/√2) = (1/√2) * (λ/√2) ) = λ/(2).

So putting it all together, the determinant is:

[-λ (λ² - 1/2)] + (λ/2) = 0.

So expanding that:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, no: Let me clarify. The first part is -λ*(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ/2). Then the second term is +λ/2. So adding them: (-λ³ + λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0.

We can factor this as λ(-λ² + 1) = 0. So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, and solutions to -λ² + 1 = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So the possible measurement outcomes are 0, 1, and -1.

The question is, what is the probability of getting 0 when we measure P? To find this, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0, express the state vector as a linear combination of the eigenvectors, and find the square of the coefficient for the 0 eigenvector.

Wait, but wait—before that, maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, since the state is given, perhaps I can compute the expectation value of P, but no, the question is about the probability of getting a specific eigenvalue (0 in this case). So I need to find the eigenvector for λ=0 and project the state onto it.

Let me find the eigenvector for λ=0. The equation is (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So equation P |v> = 0. Let |v> be (a, b, c)^T.

Then, applying P:

Row 1: (0)(a) + (1/√2)b + 0*c = (1/√2) b = 0 → b = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2)a + 0*b + (1/√2)c = (a + c)/√2 = 0 → a + c =0 → c = -a.

Row 3: 0*a + (1/√2) b + 0*c = (1/√2) b = 0 → same as row 1, so again b=0.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a). So any vector where the second component is zero and the third is negative of the first. So the eigenvectors can be written as a*(1, 0, -1). So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by (1, 0, -1).

Wait, but we can normalize this vector. The norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, the state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Let's denote this as |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To find the probability of measuring 0, we need to find the square of the amplitude of the 0 eigenvector in |ψ>.

The amplitude is the inner product between |ψ> and the normalized eigenvector |v0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)].

So amplitude a = |ψ> ⋅ |v0> = (-1)(1/√2) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/√2) = (-1/√2) + ( -1/√2 ) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

Wait, let me compute that again:

(-1) * (1/√2) = -1/√2

(2) * 0 = 0

(1) * (-1/√2) = -1/√2

So adding them up: (-1/√2) + 0 + (-1/√2) = (-2)/√2 = -√2.

So the amplitude is a = -√2. The probability is |a|^2 = (√2)^2 = 2.

Wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, hold on. Did I normalize the eigenvector correctly? Let me double-check. The eigenvector is (1, 0, -1). Its norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the inner product is correct. Let me recalculate the inner product:

|ψ> is [-1, 2, 1].

Dot product with |v0> is (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + 2*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)).

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2/sqrt(2)).

Which simplifies to (-sqrt(2)) because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2, so 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So the amplitude is -sqrt(2). The square of the absolute value is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2. But that's 2, which is greater than 1. That can't be a probability.

Hmm, that must mean I made a mistake. Because probabilities can't be more than 1. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization. Let me check again. The state |v0> is (1, 0, -1). Its norm squared is 1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but when I take the inner product, I should compute it correctly. Let me compute |ψ> ⋅ |v0>:

(-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) + 2 * 0 + 1 * (-1/sqrt(2)).

= (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)).

= (-2/sqrt(2)).

= sqrt(2) * 2 / 2? Wait, sqrt(2) is about 1.414.

Wait, 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), so -2/sqrt(2) is -sqrt(2). So magnitude squared is (sqrt(2))^2=2. Which is 2. But that's impossible.

Hmm, wait, perhaps the state vector isn't normalized. Let me check the state vector's norm. The state is [-1, 2, 1].

Norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6.

So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. So when I compute the inner product, I should normalize the state as well.

Ah, I see. So I should first normalize the state vector before computing the projection.

So the state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T, with norm sqrt(6). So the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So the amplitude is |ψ_normalized> ⋅ |v0>.

So let me compute this:

(1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ]

= (1/sqrt(6)) * [ (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) ]

= (1/sqrt(6)) * (-2/sqrt(2)).

Simplify that: (-2) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

Simplify sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3), so (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the amplitude is (-1)/sqrt(3), and the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3.


To determine the probability of measuring 0 for the observable \( P \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
The observable \( P \) is given as:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). This yields the eigenvalues \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). Thus, the possible measurement outcomes are \( 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector satisfies \( P |v\rangle = 0 \). Solving this, the eigenvector is of the form:
\[
|v_0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Normalizing this vector, we get:
\[
|v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: State Vector
The state vector is given as:
\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The norm of \( |\psi\rangle \) is:
\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]
Thus, the normalized state vector is:
\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 4: Projection onto \( |v_0\rangle \)
The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the amplitude of \( |v_0\rangle \) in \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \). The amplitude is:
\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
Calculating the dot product:
\[
\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \left( (-1) + 0 + (-1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
|\langle v_0 | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
