Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. They're asking what the speed of the light is relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that in a medium, the speed of light is v = c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, that's in a stationary medium. What happens when the medium itself is moving?

Oh right, there's this thing called the Doppler effect for light, but wait, no, that's about frequency and wavelength changes due to motion. Hmm. Or is it about the speed measurement in different frames?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving, so from the lab frame, how does that affect the speed of light in the glass?

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. Let me imagine the setup. The light is moving through the glass which is itself moving at velocity v towards the observer. Wait, the direction is a bit confusing. The problem states the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the beam (so the same direction as the light's propagation). Wait, perhaps the light is moving in the direction the glass is moving.
