Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about comparing the magnitude of two terms in a hydrogen atom's energy when exposed to a magnetic field. The magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a strength of 1 Tesla. They're talking about the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE with a specific wavelength.

Hmm. Wait, I remember that in atoms, especially hydrogen, the energy levels are quantized, and transitions between these levels emit or absorb photons. The wavelength λ here is given as 0.4861 micrometers. That's in the visible range, so probably a Balmer series transition. The Balmer-alpha line is at about 656 nm, but 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is in the blue range. So that would correspond to a transition like n=4 to n=2 or something? I'm not exactly sure, but I can look up the Rydberg formula if needed, but maybe I don't need the exact transition.

The problem is about the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moments of electrons and an external magnetic field. The coupling term in the Hamiltonian is probably the Zeeman term. The Zeeman effect is when an atom is placed in a magnetic field, causing the energy levels to split.

So the Zeeman term is H_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and S is the spin operator. But for paramagnetism, we're considering the spin-orbit coupling, or maybe the orbital magnetic moment? Wait, I think in the Zeeman effect, orbital and spin contributions are considered. But for hydrogen, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, as per the question.

Wait, the question mentions "small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)". So m can be -1, 0, +1 for the 2p orbital, etc. But I'm a bit confused because the orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, which ranges from -l to +l, so for l=1 (p orbital), m can be -1,0,+1. So m is small, as the problem states.

The paramagnetic coupling term is the Zeeman term. So the energy shift due to this term is given by ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * B * m_l * something? Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. For orbital angular momentum, μ is μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e)) * L, so H = - (e/(2m_e)) * (L · B). Since B is along Oz, L · B = L_z * B. So H = - (e B)/(2 m_e) * L_z. But L_z has eigenvalues ħ m_l. So the expectation value would be H = - (e B)/(2 m_e) * ħ m_l.

Wait, but in the context of the hydrogen atom, the orbital contribution might be small compared to the spin contribution. Or wait, in the presence of a magnetic field, the dominant contribution is the spin part, because electrons have spin-1/2, so their magnetic moment is significant. Or perhaps the question is considering the orbital magnetic moment since m is the orbital quantum number. Hmm, I'm a bit mixed up here.

Alternatively, maybe the paramagnetic coupling term refers to the spin-orbit interaction. But no, spin-orbit is a different effect. Or perhaps it's the Zeeman effect, which is the interaction of the orbital and spin magnetic moments with the external field.

But the question says "paramagnetic coupling term", which I think refers to the Zeeman effect. So the paramagnetic coupling would be the energy shift due to the external magnetic field.

The transition energy ΔE is given by the energy difference between two states, which is related to the wavelength λ. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

So the plan is to compute both the paramagnetic coupling term (ΔE_zeeman) and the transition energy (ΔE) and compare their magnitudes.

Let me start by computing ΔE.

Given λ = 0.4861 micrometers = 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, ~3e8 m/s.

So hc ≈ 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ = 486.1e-9 m:

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 ≈ let's compute that.

1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ approximately 4.09e-19 J.

Wait, but to get it into electron volts might help for comparison. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.09e-19 J is about 2.55 eV. That seems
