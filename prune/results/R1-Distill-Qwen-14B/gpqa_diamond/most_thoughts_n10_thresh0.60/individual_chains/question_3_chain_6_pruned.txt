Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation values... right, that's the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

So, I think the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state with the operator. So, for an operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. But wait, the operator here is a sum of two terms, so maybe I can split it up into the expectation of each part.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier because I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let's find the expectation of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are c_up = 0.5 and c_down = sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩. Since σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩, applying σz to |ψ⟩ would give (0.5)(+1)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)(-1)|↓⟩. Then, taking the inner product with ⟨ψ|:

⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (0.5)(+1)(0.5) + (sqrt(3)/2)(-1)(sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, let me break that down. Let me compute each term:

The first term is from ⟨↑| multiplied by σz|ψ⟩. So (0.5) * (+1) for the first part, and (sqrt(3)/2) for the second part?

Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully. The expectation value for σz is the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So:

Since ψ is a linear combination, the probability of measuring +1 (spin-up) is |c_up|^2, and the probability of measuring -1 (spin-down) is |c_down|^2.

So, |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(
