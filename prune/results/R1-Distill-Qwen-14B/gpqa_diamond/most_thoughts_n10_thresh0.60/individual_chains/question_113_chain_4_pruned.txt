Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me take a deep breath and think through this step by step. 

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas, so I'll need to match the spectral data to one of them.

First, let's go through each piece of data one by one.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. They mentioned a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. A very broad peak suggests a strong hydrogen bonding, which is common in compounds with hydroxyl groups, like alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but waitâ€”carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, but their peak is usually around 3000 cm^-1 as well. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol or a phenol. But phenols also have broad O-H stretches. Hmm.

Then, the other strong absorption peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which I'm pretty sure is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower than the typical 1700 for a ketone, so maybe that's a conjugated carbonyl or something else. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Wait, the 1650 could also be an amide I band, but that's around 1650. But wait, if there are two carbonyl peaks, that might not fit. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or perhaps an ester or something else.

Wait, another thought: 1650 cm^-1 is often where conjugated carbonyl groups or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C might be. But wait, I'm a bit confused. For example, an aromatic ring's C=C stretch is usually around 1600 cm^-1. So 1650 is a bit higher, perhaps indicating some conjugation or maybe an electron-withdrawing group affecting the C=C. Alternatively, maybe a conjug
