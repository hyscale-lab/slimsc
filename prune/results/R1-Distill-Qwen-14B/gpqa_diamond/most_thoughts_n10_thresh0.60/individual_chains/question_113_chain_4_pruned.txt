Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to analyze the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to determine which formula fits.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The problem states that there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretches. Like, for example, in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The very broad peak suggests maybe a hydrogen-bonded O-H, which is common in carboxylic acids or perhaps an -OH group in a strong hydrogen bonding environment like in a ketone? Wait, no, ketones don't have O-H. Oh, right, so O-H in alcohols is usually a broad peak, but carboxylic acids have even broader and stronger O-H absorption because of the strong hydrogen bonding in their structure. So that's one clue.

Then, the FTIR shows two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, what functional groups absorb in those regions. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which often corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 cm⁻¹ is a bit lower, so maybe an conjugated carbonyl or something else. Wait, another possibility is that the 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, like in an aromatic ring or an enone system. But wait, another thought: maybe a carbonyl group adjacent to another group, like an ester or amide. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which might have a lower wavenumber for the carbonyl peak.

So combining the two FTIR peaks: maybe two different carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is a conjugated double bond, like in an aromatic ring? Wait, but the 1650 region can also be a C=O stretch in a conjugated system. For
