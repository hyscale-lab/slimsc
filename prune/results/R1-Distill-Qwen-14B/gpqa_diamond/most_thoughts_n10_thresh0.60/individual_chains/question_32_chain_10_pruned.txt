Okay, so I have this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking me to find the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So Li-6 maybe? Because 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6.

So, the first thing I need to do is figure out the rest mass of this nucleus. The rest mass energy is given by mc². I remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c² and a neutron is similar, around 939 MeV/c² or something close. So since X has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be approximately (3 * 938) + (3 * 939) MeV/c². Let me calculate that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV, and 3 * 939 is 2817 MeV. Adding them together gives 5631 MeV. Oh wait, 5631 MeV is 5.631 GeV. So the rest energy is 5.631 GeV.

Now, the speed is given as 0.96c. I need to calculate the total energy, which includes both the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute gamma. v is 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me think, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. So 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So 3.5714 * 5.631 GeV. Let me calculate that.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857 GeV.

3.5714 * 0.631 = Let me compute that. 3.5714 * 0.6 is about 2.1428, and 3.5714 * 0.031 is about 0.1107. Adding those gives 2.2535. So total is 17.857 + 2.2535 = 20.1105 GeV.

Wait, I should be more precise. Let me do it step by step.

5.631 GeV multiplied by 3.5714:

Breaking it down:

5 * 3.5714 = 17.857
0.631 * 3.5714 = let's compute 0.631 * 3 = 1.893, 0.631 * 0.5714 ≈ 0.631 * 0.57 ≈ 0.3596. So total ≈ 1.893 + 0.3596 = 2.2526.

Adding 17.857 + 2.2526 = 20.1096 GeV, approximately 20.11 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, I approximated the gamma factor. Maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

Wait, let's re-calculate gamma. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is exactly 0.28, as 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Hmm, but perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately because maybe the approximation affects the result. Let me calculate sqrt(0.0784) precisely. Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4. sqrt(784)=28, so sqrt(784e-4)=0.28. So sqrt is exactly 0.28, so gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass. Let me double-check. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, so that's Li-6, right? The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.0141 g/mol. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the exact mass. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact mass of a proton and neutron.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be (3 * 938.272) + (3 * 939.565) = let's compute that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV

Adding them: 2814.816 +
