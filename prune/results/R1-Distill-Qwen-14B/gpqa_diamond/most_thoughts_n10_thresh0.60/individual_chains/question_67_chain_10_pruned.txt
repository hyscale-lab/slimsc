Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem involves two electrons in p orbitals. I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number l equal to 1. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l1 and l2, both equal to 1, right? Because they're in p orbitals.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I'm a little fuzzy on what each part of this ket notation means. So, I think the first two numbers are l1 and l2, which are both 1. Then l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. Oh wait, because when you couple two angular momenta, you add their magnitudes. So each l can range from |l1-l2| to l1+l2, in integer steps. So l1=1, l2=1, so l can be 0, 1, or 2. In this case, l is 2. So that makes sense.

And m is the total z-component, which is -1 here. So the state is |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. So each electron's Lz component. And the question is asking for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. Remember that ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and for angular momentum quantum numbers, the eigenvalue is mħ, right? So for each electron, m can be -1, 0, or +1 since l=1.

Wait, wait. Because each electron is in a p orbital, their individual m quantum numbers can be -1, 0, or +1. So in the coupled state, when we talk about L1z and L2z, each is associated with the individual electrons' m values.

But the problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum. So we're focusing solely on the orbital part here.

The state given is |1,1,2,-1>. So how does this state relate to the individual m1 and m2 values?

I think that the total angular momentum state is built from the combination of the individual states. The total m
