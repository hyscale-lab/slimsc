Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about the density matrix of a qubit, and I need to figure out its geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ as (1/2) times ( |0><0| + |1><1| ). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix would be a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but here it's a mixture of |0> and |1> states, each with equal weight. So this must be a maximally mixed state because each basis state has the same probability.

Wait, the maximally mixed state for a qubit is usually represented by the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the maximally mixed state in 2x2 dimensions is (I)/2, where I is the identity matrix. Let me write that down. So I is [[1, 0], [0, 1]], and dividing by 2 gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So the density matrix here is exactly that because each term |0><0| and |1><1| add up when multiplied by 1/2.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubit space. I've heard that qubit states can be visualized on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, you can represent it as a point on the surface of a unit sphere. But for mixed states, especially the maximally mixed state, how does that translate?

Wait, the Bloch sphere representation is for pure states. For mixed states, it's more complicated. I think that the density matrix can be parameterized using coordinates on the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). The vector r has a magnitude less than or equal to 1 because the density matrix must be positive semidefinite and have trace 1.

So let's write the given density matrix ρ. Expanding it, ρ = (1/2)( |0><0| + |1><1| ). Let me express this in terms of the Pauli matrices. The identity matrix I is |0><0| + |1><1|, right? So ρ is (I)/2. 

Now, according to the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Comparing, (I)/2 must equal (I + r·σ)/2. So subtracting I/2 from both sides, we get 0 = r·σ/2. Which implies that r·σ = 0. So the vector r must be zero. Because if r is zero, then all components are zero.

So the geometrical position is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. So the coordinates r would be (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is in the center of the Bloch sphere, not on the surface.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the state is a maximally mixed state, it's equivalent to having no information about the state—so it's the completely depolarized state, which has no direction in the Bloch sphere. Hence, it's at the center. Yeah, that makes sense. 

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the basis states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). The maximally mixed state in 2x2 dimensions is equivalent to \(\frac{I}{2}\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix. For a general qubit density matrix, it can be expressed in the form 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector with components \((x, y, z)\) and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), it is evident that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). 

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states lie on the surface, while mixed states are inside the sphere. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere, as it represents the absence of any directional preference or coherence. Therefore, the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).
