Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup says that Ay is equal to c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has its first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0].

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin-1/2 systems. Oh wait, S might be a Pauli matrix. Let me think: the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The σy matrix is exactly what's given for S. So S is actually the Pauli y matrix. So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by σy.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of the spin components are ±ħ/2. Wait, but here c is h/(4π) and S is σy. Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So when multiplied by c, which is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a would be (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π))*(-1). So a can be h/(4π) or -h/(4π). Wait, but wait a second, because I thought spin eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. Oh, right, because ħ is h/(2π). So ħ/2 is h/(4π). So that makes sense. So the eigenvalues of Ay are indeed ±h/(4π). 

So looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues here are real numbers. Wait, no wait. Wait, the eigenvalues are a = c * s, where s is the eigenvalue of S. S has eigenvalues ±1, so a would be (h/(4π)) * (±1). So a is a real number, not complex. So any option mentioning imaginary parts must be incorrect.

Looking at the options, option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2, but that also
