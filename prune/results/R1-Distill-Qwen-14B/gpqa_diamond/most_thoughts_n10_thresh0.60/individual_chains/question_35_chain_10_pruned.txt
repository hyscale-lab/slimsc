Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, the question is about finding the correct statement regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay.

Let me break this down. I remember that angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to Pauli matrices. The problem says that Ay is given by c times S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). Wait a minute, that looks familiar. Oh right, the Pauli matrices! Let me recall: the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. 

Let me write down S. So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait, I think σy is usually represented as:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Yes, exactly. So S is the Pauli matrix σy. So S is σy. Therefore, Ay = c * σy, where c is h/(4π).

So the operator Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy. I need to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

I remember that the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So for σy, the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(+1) and c*(-1), which would be c and -c. Let me compute that. c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but that's the real part? Or the imaginary part? Wait, no, the eigenvalues of σy are real, right? Because sigma matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues should be real numbers here.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because eigenvalues of Ay should be real. Because Ay is Hermitian? Let me think. Since S is σy, which is Hermitian (because σy^† = σy?), and c is a real number, so Ay is Hermitian. Therefore,
