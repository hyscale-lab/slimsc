Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron, maybe) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. The Pauli exclusion principle requires that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So, the final state's isospin T is given as 0. We need to find which partial wave isn't allowed.

Wait, let me break this down. The initial state is 1S0. The 1 in 1S0 is the spin multiplicity, so that's 2S+1 = 1 → S=0. So the two nucleons are in a spin-singlet state, I think.

Then, the system emits a particle X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in some other state plus X. The options give different possibilities for the final NN state and the emitted particle.

The question is about which partial wave is not permitted. Partial waves are labeled by L, so the options are about different L values. Also, the problem mentions parity conservation, so I have to think about how parity works here.

Parity is a multiplicative quantum number. For the process, the initial parity times the parity of the emitted particle should equal the final parity. Because the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

The emitted particle X has parity -1. So the parity of the system after emission should be Initial parity * parity of X * parity of the final NN state. Wait, no, the parity of the entire system (initial) must equal the parity of the final state after emission. Because parity is conserved in strong interactions, assuming that's what's happening here.

Wait, maybe the process is that the initial system has parity P_initial. The final state is the two nucleons (P_NN_final) plus the emitted particle (P_X). So P_initial = P_NN_final * P_X. Because parity is multiplicative, right? So P_initial = [P_NN_final] * [P_X].

So, P_initial is +1. P_X is -1. So 1 = P_NN_final * (-1) → P_NN_final = -1 * 1 → P_NN_final = -1. So the parity of the final NN state must be -1.

The parity of the NN state is determined by their orbital angular momentum L. The parity is (-1)^L. So (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd.

So the final state's orbital angular momentum L must be odd. So in the options, which of these have L (for the NN) as odd.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: 7D1 + p. The NN state is 7D1. D is L=2, since D is the
