Okay, let's see. I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but in parsecs I guess. So distance r would be 1/plx. Because parallax is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is reciprocal.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant. But I need to express this in terms of distance r, because the question is about how N changes with distance.

Since r is the distance, and plx = 1/r, I can substitute that into the equation. So 1/plx is r. Let me rewrite that. N = k * (r)^5. Because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait wait, let me check that substitution again. If plx = 1/r, then 1/plx = r. So 1/(plx^5) is (1/plx)^5, which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That would mean that as r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. So per unit range of distance, the number of stars changes as r^5.

Looking at the options, option B is r^5. So the answer should be B.

But wait a second, the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, so the rate of change, like dN/dr? Because the options are about how N changes with r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5r^4. But the question is phrased as "how does the number... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the number of stars as a function of r, not the rate of change. Because if N = r^5, then the number increases as r^5. So the answer is B.

Wait, the question says "varies with parallax as 1/plx^5". So N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx is 1/r, substituting, N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, N increases by r^5. So the number of stars is proportional to r^5.

So the correct option is B, which is ~ r^5.


The question asks how the number of stars in a specific region of the sky changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( 1/\text{plx}^5 \). 

Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), with the relationship \( \text{plx} = 1/r \). Substituting this into the given relation \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \), we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{(1/r)^5} = r^5.
\]

This shows that the number of stars is proportional to \( r^5 \). Therefore, as the distance \( r \) increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of \( r \). The correct option is:

**B) ~ \( r^5 \)**.

Answer: B
