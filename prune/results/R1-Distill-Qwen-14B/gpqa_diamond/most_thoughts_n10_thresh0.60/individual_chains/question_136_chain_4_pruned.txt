Okay, so I've got this problem about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let's see. The question says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R. Oh, right, so the integral is ∇·f over the volume of a sphere.

Wait, I remember something about divergence and Gauss's Law. Because if the field is radial and depends only on r, maybe I can use some symmetry here. Gauss's Law relates the integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface, but wait, isn't that another form of the same thing? Or wait, no, because the divergence theorem connects the flux through a closed surface to the volume integral of the divergence inside.

Wait, Gauss's Law in differential form is ∇·E = rho/epsilon_0, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because this isn't necessarily an electric field. But maybe the approach is similar.

Since the field is radial and f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, because it's only radial. So in spherical coordinates, the vector is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

To find ∇·f, I think I should compute the divergence of this vector field. For a radial vector field in spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r), right? Because the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with components (A_r, A_θ, A_φ) is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) d/dφ A_φ).

But in this case, A_θ and A_φ are zero because the field is only radial. So the divergence reduces to (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r).

So A_r is 1/r². Let's compute that. Plugging in, we get (1/r²) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)] = (1/r²) d/dr [1] = (1/r²)(0) = 0. Wait, that's zero. So the divergence is zero. Then, the integral of the divergence over the volume would be zero. So the answer would be zero, which is option D.

Wait a second, but I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes, like electric fields, you have a divergence that's a delta function at the origin. For example, the electric field of a point charge is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q r̂)/r². The divergence of E would be zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So if you integrate the divergence over any volume that includes the origin, you get a non-zero value.

But wait, in this problem, the vector field is given as 1/r² everywhere except maybe the origin. So if the field is 1/r² and f(r) is only radial, then inside any volume that doesn't include the origin, the divergence is zero. But wait, the sphere here is centered at the origin and has radius R
