Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system, and it emits light at 2.3393 eV. Wait, wait, when something emits light, it's because it's giving off energy. But wait, no, actually, when a molecule absorbs light, it gets excited, and then when it relaxes, it emits light. Oh right, that's fluorescence or something like that. So the dye is emitting light at that energy, which means it must have absorbed a higher energy photon earlier.

The question is about the color absorbed by the compound. So wait, the dye emits light, so the absorbed light must be of higher energy than what it emits. Because when an electron gets excited, it's absorbing a higher energy photon, then when it drops back, it emits a lower energy photon.

So the energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. I remember that the energy of light is inversely related to wavelength. The formula is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength. So higher energy means shorter wavelength, lower energy means longer wavelength.

The visible spectrum goes from violet (~400 nm) to red (~700 nm). Violet has higher energy, red lower. So, if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the emitted photon. The absorbed photon must be higher in energy because it's the energy that caused the excitation.

Wait, but wait. Wait, when the molecule absorbs light, the electron gets promoted from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, when it drops, it emits a photon with energy corresponding to the difference. So the emitted photon's energy is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. The absorbed photon must have higher energy than that?

Alternatively, maybe the emitted photon's energy is lower than the absorbed. So let's think about it numerically.

First, I need to find the wavelength of the emitted light. Once I have that, I can see which color it is. Then, since the absorbed photon's energy is higher, its wavelength is shorter than the emitted one.

So to find the wavelength, I can use E = hc/λ. Let me compute λ.

E is 2.3393 eV. I know that 1 eV is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. But maybe I can use the shortcut where 1 eV corresponds to about 1240 nm (since hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm). So λ (in nm) = 1240 / E (eV).

So plugging in E = 2.3393 eV: 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let me calculate that. 1240 divided by 2.3393.

Hmm, 2.3393 is approximately 2.34. So 1240 / 2.34 is about 529.8 nm. Approximately 530 nm. That's in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, 530 is actually more towards greenish-yellow. Wait, the colors: red is around 650-700, orange ~590, yellow ~570-590, green ~495-570, blue ~450-495, violet ~400-450.

Wait, 530 is just outside the green towards yellow. Wait, actually, 530 nm is in the green, but perhaps more towards the blue-green. Wait, I think 495 is the lower end of green, and 570 is the upper. So 530 is in the green range.

Wait but the emitted light is around 530 nm, which is green. So the dye emits green light. That means it absorbed higher energy light, which would have a shorter wavelength (blue, perhaps?), right?

Because the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted, so the wavelength is shorter. Since the emitted is green (530), the absorbed was probably in the blue or violet range.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options are Red (A), Violet (B), Blue (C), Yellow (D).

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is higher energy, so the absorbed color would be blue or violet.

But wait, the question says the compound emits light when it's excited. So the dye is absorbing light, which causes it to emit light. So the absorbed light is the one with higher energy than what's emitted.

So the emitted is green, so the absorbed must be blue or violet.

Wait, but in the visible spectrum, each color has a specific energy. For example, violet is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than blue, which is higher than green, etc.

So let's find the exact wavelength of 2.3393 eV. 1240 / 2.3393 = ?

Let me compute more precisely:

2.3393 * 530 = let me calculate 2.3393 * 530.

Wait, 2.3393 * 500 = 1169.65, 2.3393 *30=70.179; so 1169.65 +70.179=1239.829. Hmm, that's very close to 1240, so 530 nm is about correct.

So the emitted is green.

So the absorbed photon must have higher energy, so at a shorter wavelength. So the absorbed photon could be blue or violet. But which one?

Wait, but in terms of the colors, the emitted photon is green. The absorbed photon is higher energy, so blue or violet.

But the question is which color is absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon. So which color has higher energy than green?

Violet has higher energy than blue, which is higher than green.

So the absorbed photon could be in the blue or violet range. Let me check the options.

The options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

So options B and C are possible.

But wait, how does this relate to the conjugated pi-electrons? The question mentions that the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to bathochromic shifts, meaning the absorption moves to longer wavelengths (lower energy). So maybe the molecule absorbs in the visible region, like blue or green, but I'm not sure how that directly affects the calculation.

Wait, the molecule emits at 530 nm (green), so it must have absorbed a photon at a higher energy. Let me think about the relationship between absorption and emission.

The energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) is higher than the emitted (E_emit). The energy difference between E_abs and E_emit is the energy gap, which is usually in the visible range for fluorescence.

So E_abs = E_emit + energy_gap. But the energy gap is typically in the range of the visible spectrum, meaning that the absorbed photon must be in the blue or violet range.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's see where that falls in the visible spectrum.

As I calculated, 530 nm is green. So the dye is emitting green light, which means it must have absorbed higher energy (lower wavelength) light. The higher energy than green would be blue or violet.

So the absorbed light is either blue or violet.

But wait, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it becomes excited. The emission is when it relaxes, but the emission photon is usually lower energy than the absorbed one. So the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed.

So looking at the options, either B (violet) or C (blue) are possible.

But how to choose between them.

Let me think about the concept of complementary colors. The color that a substance absorbs is the complementary color of the color it emits. So if it emits green, it absorbs magenta (which is the complement of green). Wait, but wait, that's for colorimetry, not for the physics of absorption and emission. Hmm, I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, the colors in the visible spectrum have specific energy levels. The energy required for a transition is higher for shorter wavelengths.

I think the key here is that the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

Wait, no. Wait, when the molecule absorbs a photon, it excites an electron from a lower energy level to a higher one. The energy of the photon is the energy difference between these two levels. Then, when the electron drops back, it emits a photon with energy equal to the same difference. So the absorbed photon's energy is the same as the emitted photon's energy.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply that the absorbed and emitted photons have the same energy, but that's not how fluorescence works. Oh wait, perhaps in some cases, like in phosphorescence, but fluorescence usually involves a transition from an excited state to a lower state, but on a different path.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The molecule absorbs a photon (energy E1) and gets excited. Then, it emits a photon (energy E2) when it relaxes. So E1 must be greater than E2 because the molecule can't emit more energy than it absorbed. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted.

So for the emitted photon, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon's energy E_abs must be higher, so E_abs > 2.3393 eV.

Which color has higher energy than green? Violet is higher than green, blue is higher than green but lower than violet.

So E_abs must be higher than 2.3393 eV. Let's compute that.

Wait, 2.3393 eV is 530 nm. The energy of violet light is higher than that. Violet is around 400-450 nm. So its energy would be higher than 2.3393 eV.

Wait, no, let's compute the energy for 400 nm. E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV. So 400 nm is 3.1 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393 eV.

Similarly, blue is around 450 nm, E = 1240/450 ≈ 2.76 eV. Also higher than 2.3393.

So both blue and violet are higher than the emitted energy. So the absorbed light could be either blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is about which color is absorbed. So which one is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the compound absorbs light in the blue region, and emits green. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, perhaps the color of the absorbed photon is determined by the energy difference. Let me think: the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_emit + some energy, perhaps.

Wait, no, the energy of the photon absorbed is E_abs = E1 - E2, where E1 is the higher energy level, and E2 is the lower. But when the molecule emits the photon, the energy is E_emit = E1 - E2. So E_abs should be equal to E_emit. That can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me look it up in my notes mentally. Oh right, the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So when the molecule emits a photon, it emits a photon with energy E = E1 - E2. So the photon that was absorbed had energy E = E1 - E2 as well.

Wait, that would mean the emitted photon has the same energy as the absorbed one. But that's not the case because when a molecule fluoresces, the emitted photon is usually of lower energy than the absorbed photon. So perhaps some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

Ah, right, that's the case. So when a molecule absorbs a photon (E_abs), it may lose some energy through nonradiative transitions before emitting a photon (E_emit), which is less than E_abs. So E_abs is higher than E_emit.

So in this problem, E_emit = 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be higher than that.

So which color corresponds to a higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

As I calculated earlier, 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must have a wavelength shorter than 530 nm, which is blue (450-495) or violet (400-450).

Wait, but the options include Violet (B) and Blue (C). So the absorbed light is either violet or blue.

But how to choose between them.

Wait, maybe the compound has an extensively conjugated pi system, which usually absorbs in the visible region, like blue or green. But extensive conjugation tends to bathochromically shift (red shift) the absorption to longer wavelengths. So for a conjugated system, the absorption might be in the blue region. 

Wait, another approach: The energy difference between the absorption and emission levels is the energy of the emitted photon. Because the emitted photon has 2.3393 eV, that suggests that the energy gap is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work with the wavelengths.

The emitted photon is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon is higher energy, so shorter wavelength. Let's think about the colors in the visible spectrum:

- Red: ~650 nm, 1.9 eV
- Orange: ~590 nm, 2.1 eV
- Yellow: ~570 nm, ~2.17 eV
- Green: ~530 nm, ~2.34 eV
- Blue: ~470 nm, ~2.64 eV
- Violet: ~420 nm, ~3.0 eV

Wait! So the emitted is green, which is 2.34 eV. The absorbed must be higher than that, so blue (2.64 eV) or violet (3.0 eV).

So the absorbed photon could be either blue or violet.

But the question is asking what color is absorbed. So looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue.

But how do I choose between them.

Wait, the molecule emits green light. So it absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be either blue or violet. But without more information, it's a bit tricky.

But wait, when a molecule has a large conjugated system (like this one), the absorption is usually in the visible range, perhaps in the blue or even green. So if the emitted light is green, the absorbed photon might be in the blue or violet.

Wait, but in the case of many dyes, the absorption is often in the UV or blue regions. For example, many dyes used in labs absorb UV and emit visible light (like fluorescein, which is green when excited by UV).

Wait, if the dye emits green, perhaps it absorbs blue light. Because when you shine blue light on it, it absorbs that, excites, and emits green. So the absorbed photon would be blue.

But wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed photon must have higher energy (violet or blue).

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A) Red (lower energy, longer wavelength. So if emitted is green, absorbed can't be red because red is lower than green.)

Wait no, green is higher energy than red. So if the emitted is green (higher energy than red), the absorbed must be higher than green. So red is out.

So the options are B (violet) and C (blue).

Now, which one is more likely. For example, if the emitted light is green, that means the energy difference between the ground state and excited state is 2.34 eV. So the absorbed photon must have that energy or higher.

Wait no, the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy gap. Because the molecule absorbs the photon, so the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

Wait, that's correct. Because the molecule can only absorb a photon with energy equal to the energy difference between two energy levels. So if the energy gap is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must have that energy.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, meaning the energy gap is the same. So that would imply that the absorbed photon is also 2.3393 eV, which is green. But that can't be because then the emitted photon would have the same energy as the absorbed, which would require no energy loss, which is not usually the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The photon absorbed has energy E_abs, which is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So when the molecule emits the photon, the energy E_emit is also E_abs, but that would mean E_abs = E_emit. But that's not possible because of energy loss.

Wait, no, this is only true for the case when the molecule is in an excited state, perhaps. No, I'm getting confused.

Actually, the energy of the absorbed photon is exactly the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state. So when the molecule absorbs that photon, it becomes excited. Then, when it emits a photon, the emitted photon's energy is the same as the absorbed photon's energy. But wait, that's only if the molecule directly drops back, but in fluorescence, sometimes there are multiple steps, or other transitions.

Wait, but in reality, the emitted photon's energy is less than the absorbed photon's energy because some energy is lost as heat or through other nonradiative processes. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted.

So in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV (green), so the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So which color is that? Blue is 2.64 eV, violet is 3.0 eV.

So the absorbed photon is either blue or violet.

But the question is what color is absorbed. So it's either blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue.

But without more information, it's difficult to choose between the two. However, the compound has an extensively conjugated pi system, which usually absorbs in the visible region, perhaps in the blue.

Wait, but extensive conjugation leads to longer wavelengths (lower energy) for absorption. So if the molecule has a large conjugated system, it might absorb at longer wavelengths, meaning lower energy. But wait, in this problem, the emitted light is green (2.34 eV), so the absorbed must be higher, either blue or violet. But if the conjugated system is extensive, it might absorb in the blue or even green. Wait, but if the energy difference is 2.34 eV, that would correspond to green.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy required to excite the molecule (E_abs) is higher than that. Because it's the energy difference between the ground and excited state.

So E_abs = E_excited - E_ground.

Then, when the molecule emits the photon, it's E_emit = E_excited - E_ground, which is the same as E_abs. But that would mean E_abs = E_emit, which is not possible because then the emitted photon would have the same energy as the absorbed, implying no energy loss. But in practice, the emitted photon is lower energy because some energy is lost.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I should think about the energy levels.

Suppose the ground state is E1, and the excited state is E2. The energy gap is E2 - E1 = E_abs. So the absorbed photon must have E = E2 - E1.

Then, when the molecule emits a photon, it transitions from E2 to E1, so the emitted photon must have E = E2 - E1. So E_abs = E_emit.

But that can't be right because then the absorbed and emitted photons would have the same energy. But in reality, the emitted photon has lower energy, so there must be another energy state in between, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the molecule goes to a triplet state after excitation, which has a lower energy than the singlet excited state. So when it emits, it might drop from the triplet to the ground state, which has a lower energy difference, resulting in a lower energy emitted photon.

But that's getting into more detailed fluorescence mechanisms than I'm familiar with.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has multiple excited states. The initial photon excitation goes to a higher energy state, but then it relaxes to a lower energy state, and then emits a photon corresponding to the lower transition.

So the energy of the photon absorbed (E_abs) is higher than the energy of the emitted photon (E_emit).

So E_abs = E_initial_excitation - E_ground.

E_emit = E_lower_excited_state - E_ground.

So E_abs > E_emit.

So in the problem, E_emit is given as 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be greater than that.

So back to the colors. So E_abs is higher than 2.3393 eV, which is green. Therefore, the absorbed photon is either blue (2.64 eV) or violet (3.0 eV).

So the color absorbed is either blue or violet.

But the options are B and C.

Now, the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electrons system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to bathochromic shifts, which means that the absorption moves to longer wavelengths (lower energy). So if the conjugation is extensive, the absorption might be in the blue or even green.

Wait, that's confusing. Because if the absorption is in the blue, then the emitted would be lower energy than blue. But in our case, the emitted is green (2.34 eV), which is lower than blue (2.64 eV). That fits, because the absorbed is blue, which is higher energy.

But wait, if the conjugation is extensive, which usually causes the absorption to be at longer wavelengths (lower energy), then the absorption should be in the red or near infrared. But that would suggest that the absorption is lower in energy than green, which contradicts the earlier finding.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So if the conjugation is extensive, the molecule would absorb in the red or near IR. But in this case, the emitted is green, which suggests that the absorbed photon is blue or violet (higher energy), which would imply that the conjugation is not that extensive.

Wait, perhaps the conjugation in the dye allows it to absorb in the blue or green. For example, some dyes have their absorption in the blue and emit in the green. So perhaps the absorbed color is blue.

But I'm not certain. Let me think of some examples. Fluorescein, a common fluorescent dye, absorbs UV light and emits green. So in that case, the absorbed photon is higher energy (UV), which is violet or blue.

But in the question, the emitted is green, so the absorbed photon is higher than green. So if the dye has a conjugated system that absorbs in the blue, then the emitted is green. Or if it absorbs in the UV, which is even higher energy than blue.

But the options don't include UV. So if the options are violet or blue, which are both visible.

But the question says the dye emits green, so the absorbed is higher than green. So the options are B) Violet or C) Blue.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed. So if the absorbed is blue, the emitted is green. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the emitted is green, so the absorbed is blue. Because blue is higher energy than green.

So, the color absorbed would be blue, which is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, it's possible that the emitted light is green, and the absorbed is blue.

Wait, another approach: we can calculate the wavelength of the emitted light, which is 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be higher in energy, so shorter wavelength (blue or violet). The question is which one.

But without more info, perhaps the answer expects us to choose blue as the absorbed color.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is inverting the process. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green), so the color absorbed is the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But magenta isn't one of the options.

Wait, complementary colors: if something emits green, it absorbs the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Hmm. So perhaps that line of thinking isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted, so its wavelength is shorter. So if the emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed is blue (470 nm) or violet (420 nm). But the options are B and C.

So the question becomes, for a conjugated system, which is more likely, blue or violet absorption.

Wait, but most dyes with conjugated systems, especially aromatic ones, absorb in the UV or visible. Benzene absorbs in the UV, but more conjugated systems like in dyes (like phenolphthalein) may absorb in the visible.

Phenolphthalein, for example, is colorless in acidic solutions and pink in basic. Its absorption is in the UV, I think, but when it's in solution, the color is due to the transition in the conjugated structure.

Wait, another example: Bromophenol blue, which is a pH indicator. It's yellow in basic solutions and green in acidic. Its absorption is in the blue range, I believe.

So perhaps the absorbed photon is blue, making the emitted green.

So in that case, the answer would be C) Blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 530 nm (green light). The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted photon's energy because the molecule loses some energy as heat or during nonradiative transitions before emitting light.

The energy of light is inversely related to its wavelength, with higher energy corresponding to shorter wavelengths. The emitted light at 530 nm (green) has an energy of 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon must have a higher energy, meaning its wavelength is shorter than 530 nm. The visible spectrum ranges from violet (~400 nm, 3.1 eV) to red (~700 nm, 1.7 eV). Among the options provided:

- **Red (A)**: 1.7 eV (650–700 nm) is lower in energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.
- **Violet (B)**: ~3.1 eV (400–450 nm) is higher in energy than green, making it a possible candidate.
- **Blue (C)**: ~2.64 eV (450–495 nm) is also higher in energy than green, making it a possible candidate.
- **Yellow (D)**: ~2.17 eV (570–590 nm) is lower in energy than green, so it cannot be the absorbed light.

The compound has an extensively conjugated π-electron system, which typically absorbs light in the visible region. Extensive conjugation generally bathochromically shifts absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy), but the absorption must still occur at a higher energy than the emitted light. Since the emitted light is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed light must be either violet or blue.

Given the options, blue (2.64 eV) is more likely than violet (3.1 eV) because many dyes with conjugated systems absorb in the blue region and emit in the green. Therefore, the absorbed light is blue.

Answer: C
