Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's start by understanding what the setup is.

The researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They modified the gene to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

Looking at the sequence provided, it's the plus strand of the construct. Let me examine the coding sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, so that's good. Then, after that, there's TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, HA tag's sequence is usually around that area. HA is typically a peptide from the influenza virus, like YPYDVPDYA. So the first few amino acids after the start should be the HA tag.

Wait, the construct has the HA tag added at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence would have the HA sequence right after the start codon. Let me check the sequence: the first few codons after ATG are TAC (tyr), then CC (pro?), AT (maybe a frame shift?), but wait, let me parse the DNA sequence.

The given DNA sequence is 5' to 3'. Let me break it down into codons. The start is ATG, which is methionine. Next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CAT (his), then CGA (arg), then GAT (aspartic acid), then TCC (serine). Wait, that's not matching the HA tag. HA tag's DNA sequence is typically something like TAC GGC CCG CCG CC... Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide, so the DNA sequence should encode that. Let me think: HA is YPYDVPDYA. So the amino acids are Y-P-Y-D-V-P-D-Y-A. The corresponding DNA would be complementary
