Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

Let me write down the data again to keep it clear:

IR: medium to strong bands at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1. There's a strong band at 1720 cm-1.

1H NMR: 1.20 ppm (t, 3H); 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H); 4.5 ppm (q, 2H); 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H).

First, I'll analyze the IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). The medium to strong bands around 3400 cm-1 probably indicate N-H stretches. Wait, but the options have either amides or formamides or something else. Let me think: amides have N-H stretches around 3300-3500 cm-1, usually broad. That matches the IR data. Also, the 1720 cm-1 is likely an amide I band (which is around 1650-1700 cm-1) or maybe an ester or ketone. But since the compound has an amide group, that fits.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let me break it down.

The 1H NMR shows:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is likely a CH3 group attached to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe an ethyl group (like OCH2CH3), where the CH3 is at 1.2 as a triplet.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals often suggest exchange with protons, like in NH groups. But wait, the integration is 2H. Amide protons are usually around 8 ppm or so, but maybe these are part of an ethyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Or perhaps this is an amino group, but amines usually have lower ppm values. Hmm.

Wait, the 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Q is quartet. So two protons as a quartet. Quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe this is an OCH2CH2 group? Or perhaps part of an ester group, like OCH2CH3. Wait, but the integration is 2H. Let's think: if we have an ethyl group, the splitting would be triplet for the CH3 and quartet for the adjacent CH2. So the quartet at 4.5 ppm is probably the OCH2 group of an ethyl ester or an ethoxy group. Because in an ethoxy group, the -O-CH2-CH3 would split
