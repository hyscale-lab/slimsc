Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents (A and B) for two different reactions. Let's break down each reaction and see what's going on.

First Reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that under certain conditions, it forms a cyanohydrin. Wait, how does that happen? Cyanohydrin formation usually involves the addition of a cyanide ion to the carbonyl group. The reaction is typically done in a protic solvent, and acid is often used as a catalyst. Oh right, the mechanism is that the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a negative charge, which is then protonated. So in this case, A should be an acid, like H3O+ or another source of H+.

So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+ because that would protonate the oxygen after the attack, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So looking at the options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite; would that work? Or is it more likely to be a strong acid?

Wait, but NaHSO3 is also a source of H+ because HSO3^- can donate a proton. But in the first reaction, the reagent is A, which is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So for the cyanohydrin formation, which reagent is correct? I think in the cyanohydrin reaction, the acid used is usually H3O+ because it's a strong acid that can protonate the intermediate. So A is H3O+.

Second Reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So the starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) that has a hydroxyl group as well. The product is a carboxylic acid. Oh, so this is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. What conditions are used for that?

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid usually requires either strong acid or strong base, often with heat. Wait, I think in acidic conditions, the nitrile is hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different product, like an amide or an acid derivative.

Wait, but in this case, the reagent B is being added along with water. So what's the role of B here? Let me think about the hydrolysis of nitriles. 

The hydrolysis can be done in two main ways: using H2SO4 (acidic) or using a base like NaOH (but under different conditions). Wait, another possibility is using a mixture of
