Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The first part is the reaction: butan-2-one (which is methyl ethyl ketone) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is a reaction where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options provided.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN), I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. The mechanism usually involves the attack of the nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon. But I'm trying to recall what product would form here.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So the reaction would be the cyanide ion acting as a nucleophile. In the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would replace the O with CN? No, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. Reacting with NaCN and reagent A gives (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So structure is CH2C(OH)(CN)CH2CH3? Or wait, butanenitrile has four carbons, with the nitrile group.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When you add CN- as a nucleophile, the ketone would form an addition product. So the first step is the addition of NaCN, which gives a cyanohydrin.

Wait, yes! I think that's right. The reaction of a ketone with a cyanide ion gives a cyanohydrin. The mechanism is the nucleophilic attack of CN- on the carbonyl carbon, leading
