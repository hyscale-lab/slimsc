Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to unpack it step by step. I remember that exons are the coding regions of a gene, and introns are non-coding. The gene in question has five exons and four introns, which probably means it's a longer gene, but the focus is on the first exon since all the mutants have changes there.

The problem is that this barley cultivar has an anti-nutritional compound, which is bad for food use. The gene responsible for synthesizing this compound is the target. The goal is to find a mutation that will eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene's function.

Looking at the sequences provided, each mutant has a change in the first part of the exon. Let's look at each mutant and compare them to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. The ATG is the start codon, so the rest is the coding sequence.

Mutant 1: The sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’. Let me compare. The intact starts with TTTCTCGC... Mutant 1 seems to have TTCTACGC. So the third T is replaced with C? Or wait, maybe I should align the sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the changes are. Let me break down each mutation's first part:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAAC...
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG C... Hmm, wait, maybe I should look at each base position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for where the changes occur. The question says the changes are at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. So maybe the mutations are in the start codon or near it.

Wait, the start codon is ATG which is the same in all mutants. So the mutation must be in the subsequent bases. Let me compare each mutant line by line.

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CTT CTG TGC GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, perhaps I should write each one:

Intact:
ATG TTTC TCG C TGG TACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1:
ATG TTCT AC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Wait, maybe the differences are in the third and fourth codons. Let me parse the sequences:

Intact: Position 4-6 is TTT, 7-9 is CTC, 10-12 is GCT, etc.

Mutant 1: Let's see, after ATG, the next triplet is TCT (positions 4-6?), but wait, perhaps the user representation is a bit different. Hmm, perhaps the actual differences are in certain bases.

Wait, perhaps I should compare each base. Let's write each of them as a longer string.

Intact:
5'-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAACATATTTATTGTCGT... TGA-3'

Mutant 1:
5'-ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, perhaps the exact changes are: in the intact, the nucleotides after ATG are TTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So perhaps the first few bases after ATG are TTT
