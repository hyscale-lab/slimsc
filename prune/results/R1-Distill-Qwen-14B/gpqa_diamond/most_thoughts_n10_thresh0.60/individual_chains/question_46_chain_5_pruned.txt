Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and finding out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with D being 2 and so on.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, effectively swapping the ends. Grubbs is particularly good for ring-closing metathesis and also for breaking open alkenes, like in cross-metathesis. Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with a single starting alkene. So, what kind of products would that yield?

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. Let me number the carbons. Carbon 1 is the double bond start. So structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. If it's 3-methyl, that means on carbon 3, which is the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Or perhaps CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me try writing it out step by step.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So the five carbons are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Carbon 1 is double bonded to C2. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3,
