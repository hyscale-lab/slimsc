Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think about this. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. Right, I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The dot product σ · n would be σx times the x-component of n plus σy times the y-component plus σz times the z-component. But since n is a unit vector, the components squared add up to 1. So σ · n is like a sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n.

Now, the eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But I'm trying to remember if there's a property of the Pauli matrices that might make this easier. Oh right! The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so H is Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues are real, which makes sense for an observable like the Hamiltonian.

Wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. For example, σx has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Similarly, σy and σz do the same. So if H is a linear combination of these Pauli matrices, what's the structure of its eigenvalues?

Another thought: since H = ε σ · n, and σ · n is a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with a unit vector. So σ · n is a matrix
