Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is Aij. The matrix A has elements Aij = hbar/2 when iâ‰ j and 0 otherwise. Also, I need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Wait, so the operator in question has a matrix that's zero on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere off-diagonal. Let me write that out for a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems. So the matrix A would look like:

[ 0     hbar/2
  hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, but that's a 2x2 matrix. The eigenstates of this operator will be the basis for the measurement probabilities. So the first step is to find the eigenstates of matrix A.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: since A is a 2x2 matrix that's zero on the diagonal and same value off-diagonal, I think it's a special kind of matrix. Maybe it's proportional to the Pauli X matrix? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, yes. Because the Pauli matrices are defined as:

X = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So if A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]], then that's (hbar/2) * X.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of X, right? Because any scalar multiple of a matrix has the same eigenvectors. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X, which are |+x> and |-x>, the spin eigenstates in the x-direction.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, which are
