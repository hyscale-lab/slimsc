Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question says that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. They're talking about small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. I remember that m can take values from -l to +l in integer steps, so small m might mean m is close to zero or maybe m is small in magnitude. Not sure yet, but perhaps it's about the magnitude relative to something else.

The main task is to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field, with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers. Wait, that's the wavelength for a specific transition, probably the Balmer series. Oh right, the Balmer-alpha line is around 656 nm, but wait 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer-beta line, like the H-beta line, which corresponds to a transition from n=4 to n=2. But maybe the exact transition isn't crucial for the calculation here.

So, first, I need to calculate or estimate the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The paramagnetic term is usually given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ is the Bohr magneton multiplied by m, the magnetic quantum number. The formula for the magnetic moment is μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor. Wait, but in some contexts, especially for the orbital part, g might be taken as approximately 1. Or maybe it's g=1 for orbital and 2 for spin, but in this case, I'm not sure if it's orbital or spin. Wait, the problem says "paramagnetic coupling term", which I think refers to the orbital contribution, not spin. Because paramagnetism in atoms with unpaired electrons (like free electrons) is often due to spin. But for orbital contributions, maybe it's different. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the orbital magnetic moment is given by L·B, right? The energy is -μ_L · B, where μ_L is the orbital magnetic moment. The orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m / l, but wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, I remember that the orbital magnetic moment μ_L is given by μ_L = μ_B * m / l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Wait, no, I think the orbital magnetic moment is μ_L = (μ_B) * (m / l) * sqrt(l(l+1)). Or is it μ_L = (μ_B) *
