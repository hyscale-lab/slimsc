Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let's see, the question gives me information about each star and the capabilities of the spectrographs.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But their limiting magnitudes are different. The user mentioned that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, anything fainter than 17 mag wouldn't be detected by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, for HIRES, stars need to be brighter (smaller magnitude number) than 16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the brightness is inverse. Lower magnitude means brighter. So the cutoff is that ESPRESSO can see stars with V_mag less than or equal to 17, and HIRES can see those with V_mag less than or equal to 16. Because, for example, a star that's magnitude 17 is fainter than 16. So only stars that are brighter than (i.e., have lower apparent mag) than 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES.

But wait, the question says for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that's V_mag < 17. Similarly, for HIRES, V_mag <16. So a star that's, say, V_mag=15 is visible by both. But a star with V_mag=16 would be visible by HIRES but not by ESPRESSO (since 16 <17 is true, so ESPRESSO can see it? Wait, wait, wait, I think I got this wrong. Let me read the question again.

Question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

Wait, brighter than 17 means that their V magnitude is less than 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitude is brighter. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So for ESPRESSO, any star with V <17 is observable.
