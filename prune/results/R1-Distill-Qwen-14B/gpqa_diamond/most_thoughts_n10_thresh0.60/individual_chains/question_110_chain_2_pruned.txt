Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars meet the brightness criteria for both.

First, I'll try to understand the given data. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, meaning apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent V mag ≤16. So any star that's brighter than 17 mag (i.e., apparent V ≤17) can be seen by ESPRESSO, but for HIRES, it's only those with apparent V ≤16.

Wait, wait, I think I got that backwards. Because lower magnitude means brighter, right? So if a star is magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17. So for HIRES, stars must be ≤16, which is brighter than ESPRESSO's limit of ≤17. So a star must have apparent V ≤16 to be detected by both, because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can only go up to 16. So the star's apparent V must be ≤16 to be detected by both. Or wait, maybe the other way around? Because the question says "stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, that wording is confusing. Oh, because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's V mag is brighter than 17 (which would mean magnitude less than 17), then it's within ESPRESSO's capability. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag, meaning V mag less than 16.

Wait, no. Let me parse this correctly. The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Wait, that might mean that the apparent magnitude must be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Because if a star is brighter than 17, its magnitude is less than 17. So, the stars must have apparent V mag ≤17 for ESPRESSO to see, and ≤16 for HIRES
