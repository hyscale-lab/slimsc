Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm, let me think. The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy through fusion. The pp-III branch is a specific part of that process.

So, the Sun emits a lot of neutrinos, and these neutrinos reach Earth. The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two different energy bands after this hypothetical event. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio of their fluxes, F1/F2.

Wait, the pp-III branch stops. I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly in the 1-10 MeV range. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces neutrons, which then go on to form deuterium in the proton-proton (pp) chain. The neutrons are produced via the reaction where a proton captures a positively charged pion (π+), which in turn comes from the decay of a neutron.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The pp chain starts with two protons colliding. The first step is when two protons fuse, producing a deuterium nucleus and a positron, releasing a neutrino. That's the pp-I branch. Then, the deuterium nucleus can capture another proton to form a tritium nucleus (pp-II), and then another proton to form helium-4 (pp-III). Alternatively, the deuterium nucleus can capture an electron neutrino to produce another deuterium nucleus (pp-II branch).

So the pp-III branch involves the formation of helium-4 from two deuterium nuclei. But wait, I might be mixing that up. I think actually, the pp-III branch is when a proton captures a neutron to form deuterium, but that's not right. Alternatively, the pp-III branch could be when a proton captures a neutron from the reaction that produces neutrons via the π+ decay.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me recall. The pp chain has several branches, but the main one is the pp-I, which is the dominant process. The pp-
