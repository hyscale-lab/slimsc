Okay, so I have this neutrino flux question about the Sun, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about what happens to the neutrino flux ratio when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. The flux ratio is between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to find Flux(band 1)/Flux(band 2).

Hmm. First, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of neutrinos in the Sun. The pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, I think, which produces a lot of protons and eventually leads to helium. The pp-II and pp-III are minor branches.

Wait, the question specifies the pp-III branch stopped. So I should focus on the neutrinos produced by pp-III. Let me recall: the pp-III reactions involve higher energies, maybe. Like, perhaps reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos compared to the main pp-I branch.

I think the main neutrino types from the Sun are from the proton-proton chain (pp) and the CNO cycle. The pp chain produces electron neutrinos, mostly. The CNO cycle also produces electron neutrinos, but I think at higher energies.

Wait, the pp chain has several branches. The pp-I branch is the dominant one, where two protons fuse into deuterium and then another proton. The pp-II branch involves the fusion of a proton with a deuterium nucleus, but perhaps through a different pathway. The pp-III branch is another minor pathway, maybe involving triple-alpha reactions or something else.

Wait, no, the triple-alpha is part of helium burning in the core, right? So perhaps pp-III is a minor part of the pp chain. Maybe it's a higher-energy process. For the neutrinos, each branch might produce neutrinos of different energies.

I remember that the main pp-I reactions produce lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO cycle produces higher-energy ones. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, perhaps it's a source of some high-energy neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio between two specific energy bands. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, maybe the flux in certain energy ranges will drop.

Let me think about the energy distribution. The pp chain produces most neutrinos in the lower energy range, but some branches could contribute to higher energies. Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, I think that the pp-I branch produces neutrinos around a few hundred keV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III branches might be in between.

So if pp-III stops, which neutrinos are affected? Maybe the neutrinos in a certain high-energy range.

Wait, the energy bands are 700-800 (band1) and 800-900 (band2). So both are in the higher end, but band2 is a bit higher.

If pp-III was a major contributor to neutrinos in band2, then stopping it would reduce that flux more than band1. So Flux(band1)/Flux(band2) would go up or down?

Alternatively, perhaps the flux in each band comes from different sources. If pp-III is a main source for band2, and the CNO cycle contributes more to band1.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure my thoughts.

First, what neutrino emission comes from the pp-III branch? I think the main pp chain produces neutrinos via the reactions:

pp -> deuterium + e+ + ν_e (low energy)
deuterium + proton -> helium-3 + gamma
He-3 + He-3 -> He-4 + 2 protons + 2 electrons + 2 ν_e (this is pp-I, higher energy)

Wait, the third step in pp-I produces higher-energy neutrinos, like around 1-2 MeV. So the main neutrino line from the Sun is around ~0.5 Me
