Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, the state is given as (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think that means a two-component vector where the first component is 3i and the second is 4. So the spin state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T, right?

The question is about finding the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, the expectation value is like the average value you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on systems in this state. The formula for expectation value is <S_y> = χ† σ_y χ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y.

Wait, σ_y is given as a matrix:
0   -i
i    0
So σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

And the state χ is [3i,4]^T. So to compute this, I'll have to do the matrix multiplication step by step.

First, I need to compute χ†, the conjugate transpose of χ. χ is already a column vector, so χ† is a row vector with elements [3i*, 4*]. Wait, 3i is the first component, so its conjugate is -3i. The second component is 4, which is real, so its conjugate is 4. So χ† is [-3i, 4].

Next, I have to compute χ† multiplied by σ_y. Let me write that out:

χ† σ_y = [ -3i   4 ] * [ 0   -i ]
           [        ]   [i    0 ]

Matrix multiplication. So the first element is (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 +4i =4i.

The second element is (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, i squared is -1, so 3i^2 is 3*(-1) = -3. So that's (-3i)*(-i) = 3i^2 = -3. Wait, wait, let me compute that again. (-3i) multiplied by (-i) is (3i^2) because (-3i)*(-i) = 3i^2
