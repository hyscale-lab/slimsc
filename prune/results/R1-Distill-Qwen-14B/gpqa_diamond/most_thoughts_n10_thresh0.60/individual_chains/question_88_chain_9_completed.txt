Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some processes happening in the immune system. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but let's break it down.

So, the question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid. Wait, I remember that the stomach has a lot of acid, which probably denatures proteins, so maybe the GFP isn't working anymore in those cases. But some of them made it through to the intestines. Oh right, the small intestine is where a lot of immune stuff happens, especially with the Peyer's patches.

They observed that some proteins got entangled in the mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs are like the places where immune responses get activated—like lymph nodes and Peyer patches. So the ones that reached the Peyer patches were then isolated for proliferating cells. These cells are probably B cells, since they're the ones that make antibodies and have variable regions.

The sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes showed high variability. High variability in the variable regions—that makes me think about how B cells generate diversity. B cells have this process where they rearrange their genes to create unique antibodies. Wait, but when? VDJ recombination happens during the development of B cells in the bone marrow, right? So that's the initial diversification. But after that, when B cells are activated, there's another process. Oh, right! Somatic hypermutation. That occurs in the germinal centers after the initial antigen encounter. It increases the diversity of the antibodies by mutating the variable regions.

So in this scenario, the B cells have taken up the antigen (the rotavirus capsid proteins). Once they're in the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, those B cells would be activated. They start proliferating, and as they do, they undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies. That explains the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after sequencing.

The options are A to D. Let's think about each:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This happens after the initial immune response, in the germinal centers. It causes point mutations in the variable regions, increasing diversity.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, but it doesn't directly cause changes in the B cell receptors. It's more about marking pathogens for destruction.

C) Class switching recombination: This is when the B cell changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) but doesn't change the variable regions. It's about the constant region.

D) VDJ recombination: This is the initial gene rearrangement during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's when the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes are combined to make the unique antigen receptors. But this process happens earlier, not during the immune response after antigen contact.

So in this case, since the B cells are already activated and have started proliferating in the Peyer patches, the process observed is somatic hypermutation, which leads to high variability in the variable regions. So the answer should be A.


The question involves rotavirus capsid proteins tagged with GFP being delivered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid, while others reach the intestinal mucus and eventually the Peyer patches, where proliferating cells are isolated and their variable heavy chain genes are sequenced, showing high variability.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, the following options are considered:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers after antigen activation, leading to point mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing antibody diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure.

- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves marking pathogens for destruction but does not directly alter the B cell receptor sequence, making it irrelevant to the observed variability.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variable regions of the heavy chain, so it does not explain the observed variability.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This is the initial gene rearrangement during B cell development in the bone marrow, which occurs before antigen exposure. It is not relevant to the scenario described, where the B cells are already activated and proliferating in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after antigen activation and during B cell proliferation in the germinal centers. This process increases the diversity of the antibody repertoire.

Answer: A
