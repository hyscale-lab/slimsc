Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Alright, the question says that both Planet_1 and Planet_2 have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period is related to distance via Kepler's third law.

Also, both have circular orbits. So that simplifies things a bit since eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The stars: the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. Wait, that's interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, their radii are same. Hmm, does that affect the probability of transit?

I think the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2, but wait no, that's not exactly right. Actually, the probability depends on the relative size of the planet to the star, but it's more about the orbital plane's alignment.

Wait, no, the geometric probability for a planet to transit is approximately (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. Oh wait
