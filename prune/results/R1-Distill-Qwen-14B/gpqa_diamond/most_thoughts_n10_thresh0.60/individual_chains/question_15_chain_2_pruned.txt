Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about detecting transiting planets using the transit method. Researchers want to choose which planet to observe because they have limited time. They've already found both planets using the radial velocity (RV) method, so they know their masses and orbital periods. Both planets have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Both orbits are circular.

The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but the host star of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. Hmm, but same radii, so that's interesting.

They want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So, which one has a higher chance?

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star. More specifically, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But how do we calculate the probability?

Oh right, the transit probability (p) is given by the formula p = R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the host star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I think it's actually p = (R_star / a) multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's the ratio of the areas? No, wait, I think the probability is approximately equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because for a circular orbit, the chance that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is proportional to R/a.

Wait, no, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Another way to remember is that the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, because the area where the planet can be in the correct position is a circle of radius a, and the area that would cause a transit is a circle of radius R_star. Wait, no, that's not exactly how it works. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, the transit probability can be thought of as the fraction of the orbit where the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. But I think the correct formula for the probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. 

So, p = (R_star) / (a) multiplied by something else? Or maybe it's R_star / (a * (something))? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's get the formula right. The probability of a transit is given by (R_*/a) / (1 - (R_*/a)^2)^(1/2). Or maybe not. Alternatively, I think the formula for the probability is (R_*/a), but that's probably an approximation. Oh wait, another approach: the probability (p) is equal to the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis, p = R*/a. But wait, I'm not sure. Wait, no, I think it's actually p = (R*/a) because you're looking at the plane of the sky and the chance that the planet's orbit intersects our line
