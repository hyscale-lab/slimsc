Okay, so I have this problem where an electron is in a spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve some matrix operations with Pauli matrices. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the spin state is given as a vector (3i, 4). I guess this is a two-component vector representing the quantum state. So, the state vector is ψ = [3i, 4]^T, right? Because in spin-1/2 systems, the state is a two-element column vector.

The expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Oh wait, no, actually the Pauli matrices are scaled by ħ/2, right? Because the spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

The Pauli y matrix σ_y is given here: it's a 2x2 matrix with 0, -i in the first row and i, 0 in the second. So σ_y = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y would be (ħ/2) times that matrix.

So the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ, right? Since ψ is a column vector, the conjugate transpose ψ† would be a row vector. Let me write this out step by step.

First, compute ψ†, which is [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is 3i, the complex conjugate would be -3i. And 4 is real, so 4* is 4. So ψ† is [-3i, 4].

Then, multiply ψ† by S_y. Since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, let me compute ψ† σ_y first, and then multiply by (ħ/2).

Let me compute ψ† σ_y. σ_y is the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply ψ† (which is a 1x2 vector) with σ_y (2x2), I need to do a matrix multiplication.

Wait, no, wait. ψ† is 1x2, σ_y is 2x2. So the product ψ† σ_y would be 1x2. Let me compute each element.

The first element of the product is (ψ†_1 * σ_y[1,1]) + (ψ†_2 * σ_y[2,1]). So that's (-3i)(0) + (4)(i) → 0 +4i = 4i.

The second element is (ψ†_1 * σ_y[1,2]) + (ψ†_2 * σ_y[2,2]). So (-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) → (-3i)(-i) is (3i^2) because i*(-i) is -i² = 1? Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, σ_y[1,2] is -i. So ψ†_1 is -3i. So multiply (-3i) * (-i) = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, that's 3*(-1) = -3.

And the second term is 4 * 0 = 0. So the second element is -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3]. Now, multiply this by σ_y ψ. Wait, no, I think I messed up the order. Oh, wait, no. The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. So S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so the calculation is ψ† (σ_y) ψ, multiplied by (ħ/2).

Wait, no, no. Let me correct that. The calculation is ψ† (σ_y) ψ, and then multiply by (ħ/2). Because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So, let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ. Wait,
