Okay, so I've got this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf fψ(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, the interaction term must be something like λ times some fermion fields multiplied by X. But maybe the exact form isn't crucial for determining the decay products since that's about energy and masses.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, kinematically allowed means the decay products must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV, right? Because the rest mass of X must be enough to produce the particles.

Looking at the options, they list various decay channels. Let's think about the possible fermion pairs. The options include different quarks and leptons.

For the decay X → particles, the particles must each be a pair of fermions (like a quark and antiquark, or a lepton and antilepton). Each fermion pair would require that their combined rest mass is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me list out the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV (but in reality, current quarks have masses like 2-5 MeV, but when they're bound, their effective mass is higher. Wait, but for decay products, we're considering the rest mass of the quarks. Hmm, but wait, in the context of pair production, the mass is the sum of the rest masses of the two particles, right?

Wait, no. For a particle at rest decaying into two particles, the total rest mass of the decay products must be less than or equal to the mass of the parent particle. Since the X is a boson, it's similar to a Higgs decay in some ways. So, for each possible decay channel, the sum of the rest masses of the two particles (like, for a quark and antiquark, each of mass m, so sum is 2m) must be ≤ 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait. For fermions, each decay would produce a pair of particles, like a quark and antiquark. So for each pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to X's mass.

But wait, mass is a tricky concept here because for quarks, their current masses are much lighter, but when you have bound states like mesons, the masses are higher. But in this case, the X is decaying into a quark and antiquark, each with their rest masses. So for each quark flavor, I need to check if 2m_quark ≤ 6 GeV.

Wait, let me get the approximate masses right. I think the current quark masses (in MeV) are approximately:

- Up (u): ~2.2 MeV
- Down (
