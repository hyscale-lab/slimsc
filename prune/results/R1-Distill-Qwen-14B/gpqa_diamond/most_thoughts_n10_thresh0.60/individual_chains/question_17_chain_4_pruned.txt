Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, wait, I think I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. So, in this case, calcium is binding with EDTA to form a complex. The complex is given as 0.02 M. So the solution has this Ca-EDTA complex present.

I think the key here is to use the formation constant (K) for the complex. The formation constant tells us how much the complex is formed. The higher the K, the more stable the complex. Since K is 5e10, which is a large number, the complex is quite stable.

The complex is Ca-EDTA, so the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. And the formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this case, we're given the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M.

So, the K expression is K = [CaEDTA²-] / ( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] )

But wait, in solution, EDTA exists in various protonated forms, right? Because EDTA is a polyprotic acid and can lose protons depending on the pH. Oh, but the problem says the pH is ideal. So I think that means that the pH is such that EDTA is in its Y^4- form, which is the most deprotonated. So we don't have to worry about other forms of EDTA. That simplifies things.

Wait, but wait. If the pH is ideal, that probably means that all the EDTA is available as Y^4- and not protonated. So the concentration of EDTA^4- is equal to the free EDTA in solution. So the [EDTA^4-] is the same as the concentration of EDTA that's not bound in the complex.

So, let's think about the initial situation. The solution has the Ca-EDTA complex at 0.02 M. When this complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, how much does it dissociate? Well, with a K of 5e10, which is quite large, it suggests that the complex is very stable. So the dissociation won't be much. So the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be very low.

So, let me set up the variables. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Since the stoichiometry is 1:1 for Ca²+ and EDTA, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x.

But wait, the initial concentration of
