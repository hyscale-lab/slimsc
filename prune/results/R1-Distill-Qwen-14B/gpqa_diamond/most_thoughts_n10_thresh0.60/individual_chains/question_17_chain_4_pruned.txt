Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So, in this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and we're supposed to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution.

Wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA. Stochiometric implies that the molarity of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M.

EDTA complexes are usually written as CaY²- because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, forming a very stable complex. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but the formation constant is given as K_Ca-EDTA = 5e10. So, Kf is 5x10^10.

The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²-. So, we have the concentration of the complex. But we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+.

Wait, but how? Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and in solution, some of the EDTA might be in different protonated forms, but the problem says the pH is ideal. Oh, right, I think in this case, the EDTA is already in the correct form (Y^4-), so we don't have to worry about the alpha fraction. So, the formation constant is valid as given.

So the initial assumption is that [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M. The rest of the solution is in equilibrium. So, the Kf equation would help us find [Ca²+] because the other part is [EDTA^4-].

Wait, but wait. Since the EDTA is in excess? Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The problem gives us the concentration of the complex, so we can set up the equation.

Let me denote [CaEDTA²-] as 0.02 M. Let's let [Ca²+] = x. Then, [EDTA^4-] would be y.

But given that the complex is the only source of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, wait, no. Because when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

So, the initial concentration before dissociation is 0.
