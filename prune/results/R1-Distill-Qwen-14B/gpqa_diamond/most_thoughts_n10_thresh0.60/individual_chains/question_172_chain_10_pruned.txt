Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the layer of a star where light is emitted, right? And they're talking about iron atoms in different energy levels. Oh wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the excitation here refers to their energy states.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I think that's a specific value, but maybe it's a red herring because the problem is asking about the relation between temperatures.

The question says to assume the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio between two energy levels.

I remember the formula: the ratio of populations (n_i / n_j) is equal to the Boltzmann factor, which is exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) ). Here, E_i is the higher energy level and E_j is the lower one. Since the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in this specific energy level, that must mean the population of the higher level in star_1 is twice that in star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. Let's say E is the energy level in question. Suppose in star 1,
