Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says both Planet_1 and Planet_2 have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because orbital period relates to the distance from the star. Kepler's third law comes into play here.

The stars: Planet_1's host has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. Wait, if two stars have the same radius but different masses, that probably affects their brightness or something else. But for the transit probability, what's important is the size of the star relative to the planet.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_planet / R_star)² * (a / h²), where a is the semi-major axis, and h is related to the star's radius and the distance of the planet's orbit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, I think the transit probability depends on the planet's orbital
