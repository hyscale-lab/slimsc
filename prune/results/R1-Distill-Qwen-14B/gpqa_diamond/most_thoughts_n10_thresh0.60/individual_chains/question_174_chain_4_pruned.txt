Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, M_initial is the original nucleus, which splits into two parts. 

Wait, the rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh right, because E=mcÂ², so the rest mass energy is given. But when the nucleus splits, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of M. So that means some mass is lost, right? Because in fission, some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms, like binding energy perhaps.

Wait, the initial rest mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments is 0.99M. So the mass defect would be 0.01M. Which would correspond to energy released, right? Oh, because according to Einstein's equation, mass defect times c squared is the energy released.

But let me focus on the question. The problem is about the kinetic energies of the two fragments. The more massive one has a kinetic energy T1. We need to find the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation of T1.

So, the steps probably involve calculating T1 using both methods and finding the difference.

First, let's model the problem. The nucleus is initially at rest, so total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions with momenta such that their vector sum is zero. So, their momenta are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me denote the masses. Let the smaller fragment have mass m, so the larger one has mass 2m. But wait, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99M, so m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. Therefore, m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. So the larger fragment is 0.66 M, the smaller is 0.33 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass of the nucleus
