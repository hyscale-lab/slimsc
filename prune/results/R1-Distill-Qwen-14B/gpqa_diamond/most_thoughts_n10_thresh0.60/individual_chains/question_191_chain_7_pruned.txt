Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit complex, but I think I can break it down step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound given is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. I need to follow the reaction steps and figure out what product 4 looks like. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, the initial compound: 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me try to visualize this structure. Cyclohexanone means a six-membered ring with a ketone group on carbon 1. On carbon 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (CH₂OH), and on carbon 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH₂C(=CH₂)-, right? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Propene is CH₂=CHCH₂. So the prop-1-en-2-yl group would be CH₂CH₂CH₂ with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure would be CH₂-C(=CH₂)- attached. Wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH₂=CH-CH₂, but
