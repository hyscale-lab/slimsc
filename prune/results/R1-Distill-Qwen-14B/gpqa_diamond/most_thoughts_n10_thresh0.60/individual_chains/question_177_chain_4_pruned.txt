Okay, so I need to figure out the problem here. Let me read it again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. They also found that Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us, while Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s.

Assuming the stars radiate as black bodies, we need to compute the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So, L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. If λ_max is the same, T must be the same.

Wait, but wait a second. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So when a star moves towards us, its light is blueshifted (shorter wavelength), and if it's moving away, it's redshifted (longer wavelength). But in this case, Star_1 has 0 velocity, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted wavelength. Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, so its observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. But the question says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So does that mean the observed wavelengths are the same, or the emitted wavelengths?

The question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed wavelengths are the same. So Star_2's emission is Doppler shifted so that its observed λ_max is same as Star_1's.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving away, its observed λ_max would be longer than its emitted λ_max. Star_1's observed λ_max is its own λ_max (since its velocity is zero). So for the observed λ_max of Star_2 to be the same as Star_1's, Star_2's emitted λ must be shorter than Star_1's. Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, Star_2 is moving away, so the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So the observed λ_max for Star_2 is longer than its emitted λ_max. But the problem says the observed λ_max for both stars is the same
