Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this physics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm.

Alright, the setup is a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. The magnetic quantum number m is small, and B is 1 Tesla. I need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which would be the paramagnetic coupling term) to the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers... that's in the visible range, right? I remember that the H-alpha line is around 656 nm, but this is 486 nm, which is a bit bluer, maybe the Balmer series? Let me think. Oh right, 486 nm is the Balmer beta line, corresponding to a transition in hydrogen. The energy of the photon emitted or absorbed would correspond to ΔE.

But first, let's think about the paramagnetic coupling term. I think this is the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian for an electron in a magnetic field is something like H = -μ·B. Since the field is along Oz, the magnetic moment μ would be in the z-direction. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

So, the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to m times B. But wait, in this case, the problem says m is small. So the coupling term would be small, but how does it compare to the transition energy?

The transition energy ΔE is given by the photon energy. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. Let me calculate the energy using E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So plugging in the numbers:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (486.1e-9 m)
Let me compute that step by step. The denominator is 486.1e-9 m, which is 4.861e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (4.861e-7) => Let's compute numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 4.861e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.086e-19 J.

Hmm, but wait, I think it's easier to remember that the energy levels of hydrogen are on the order of electronvolts. Let me convert this to eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.086e-19 J is about 4.086 / 1.602 ≈ 2.55 eV. Wait that's not right because I know the Balmer series is in the visible range, which corresponds to lower energies. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm. Let me recalculate E in eV.

E (eV) = 1240 eV·nm / wavelength (nm)
So 1240 /
