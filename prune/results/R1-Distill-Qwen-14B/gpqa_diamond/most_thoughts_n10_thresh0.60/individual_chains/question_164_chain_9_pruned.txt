Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, it's about binary star systems and figuring out which one is more massive. I'm a bit rusty on my binary star mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, they did spectroscopic observations and found the radial velocity (RV) variations. 

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is: by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? And they're considering the mass as the sum of both stars.

Wait, I remember that in binary star systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift as the stars move towards and away from us. The amplitude of the velocity depends on the mass of the companion. But I'm a bit confused about how exactly the velocity relates to the mass.

Oh right, the mass function comes into play here. For a spectroscopic binary, you can only measure the velocity of one star because you can't see the other. But wait, in this problem, they have the amplitudes for both stars, maybe? Like, for system_1, star A has 10 km/s amplitude, star B has 5 km/s. So the mass ratio would be something to do with their velocities. Because for a binary system, the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, right? So the velocity is inversely proportional to the mass. Oh wait, that's Kepler's third law in action.

Wait, let me think. The mass function relates the velocities to the masses. The formula I remember is something like (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = ( (4π²) / (G) ) * (a1^3) / P², but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, for two stars in a binary system, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Because the center of mass is the balance point. So M1 * v1 =
