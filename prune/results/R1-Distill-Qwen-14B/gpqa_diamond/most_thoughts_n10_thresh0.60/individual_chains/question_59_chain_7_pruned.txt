Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the key here is to figure out whether there's excess acid or base after the neutralization. The pH will depend on that.

Let me list out the solutions:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid.
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl. That's a strong acid.
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH-.

So, I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Let's calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. Volume is 500 mL = 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = M × V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl. Volume 400 mL = 0.4 L, M=0.2. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Now Ba(OH)2. Volume 300 mL = 0.3 L. M=0.3. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when OH- reacts with H+, they neutralize each other. So the total H+ from both acids is CH3COOH + HCl. But CH3COOH is weak, so it won't dissociate completely. Hmm, but in this case, since it's a mixture with strong acid, I think the strong acid will dominate. Or does the weak acid contribute some H+ too?

Wait, maybe I should think of all the H+ from both acids and the OH- from the base. Let me compute the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+:

From HCl: 0.08 moles (since it's strong, fully dissociates)
From CH3COOH: it's a weak acid
