Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I have to use special relativity formulas. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Alright, I think the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because when speeds are a significant fraction of c, you can't use the classical velocity addition. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. Let me recall the formula. I think it's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, both are moving in the same direction, so their relative speed is the difference between the two speeds. So v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c.

So plugging that in: (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c² / c²) = 1-0.3=0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. Hmm, so roughly 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so I need to calculate the energy for each and sum them up.

The energy of a relativistic object is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Let's compute gamma1.
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8=1.25.

So energy E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75). Wait, sqrt(0.75) is about 0.8660, so 1/0.8660≈1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option B is E=4.96 mc² but v_rel=0.1c, which doesn't match. Option D says E=5mc², which is a rounded figure but not as precise.

So the correct answer should be option C. Let me double-check the relative speed calculation. (0.6c - 0.5c) is 0.1c. Divided by (1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) = 1 -0.3=0.7. So 0.1 /0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer must be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

- Numerator: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
- Denominator: \(1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
