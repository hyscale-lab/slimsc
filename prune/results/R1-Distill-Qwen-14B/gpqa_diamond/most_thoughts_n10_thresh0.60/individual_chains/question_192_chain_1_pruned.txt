Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The cavity's radius is r, and r is less than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, so I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I remember something about conductors and charge distribution. Let me think. When you have a conductor, charges can move freely. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. Then, when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, what happens?

Oh right! In a conductor, the charges redistribute themselves. Since the conductor was neutral, putting a positive charge inside the cavity would induce negative charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor itself is neutral, the outer surface must then have an induced positive charge to balance it out.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The conductor was uncharged. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q because the charge inside the cavity attracts the opposite charge on the conductor. Since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's total charge is zero, but the inner surface is -q and the outer surface is +q.

But wait, the conductor was uncharged, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. So yes, inner is -q, outer is +q. So the outer shell has a net charge +q.

Now, the question is about the electric field at point P outside the conductor. So point P is outside, at a distance L from the conductor's center. What determines the electric field outside a conductor?

I remember that the electric field outside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So for a spherical conductor with
