Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum concepts, but let's see if I can work through this step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look normalized. Oh right, because the state vectors in quantum mechanics are usually represented as unit vectors. So I should probably normalize this first. Let me calculate the norm.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]. So the squared magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*[-1, 2, 1]^T. Wait, but in the question, when they give the state, maybe they already have the vector as a unit vector? Or maybe not. Because the given vector elements are (-1,2,1), which sum squares to 6, so I think it's not normalized. So the actual state vector is the normalized version.

So the state vector |ψ> is (1/√6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

Next, the problem talks about two observables, P and Q. The operators are given as their matrices.

Operator P has elements:
First row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)
Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))
Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)
Wait, let me write that matrix:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

And operator Q is a diagonal matrix:
Q = [ [1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -1] ]

So, the problem asks: What is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring P first and then Q?

Wait, no. Wait, the measurement order is P first, then Q. Or is it the other way around? The question says: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". Oh, right, so first they measure
