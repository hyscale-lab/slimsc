Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think this through.

The problem states that astronaut one has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut two has a mass of 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in special relativity isn't as straightforward as classical mechanics. Right, because you can't just add velocities like in Newtonian physics. The formula for relative velocity between two objects moving at speeds u and v in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Let me get this straight. If one object is moving at u relative to the other, and another is moving at v relative to the same frame, then their relative speed from the perspective of the first would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Or maybe I have the order wrong. Let me think: if the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c in the same direction as the second, which is moving at 0.5c, then from the first's frame, the second is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, that's (0.
