Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just add them normally because of the speed limit being the speed of light. Oh right, the velocity addition formula comes into play. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + uv/cÂ²), but I'm not entirely sure if I'm applying it correctly here.

So the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c. Wait, but are they moving in the same direction? Oh yes, the question says both are moving in the positive x-direction. So I need to find the relative speed of one with respect to the other. Let me think about which one is moving faster. Oh, 0.6c is faster than 0.5c. So the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait no, because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.1c. Because in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. So I need to use the velocity addition formula. But wait, who's the observer here? Let's clarify.

I think the relative speed would be how one astronaut sees the other moving. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction
