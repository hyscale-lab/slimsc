Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4 after a series of reactions. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through each reaction carefully.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Okay, so the first reaction is treatment with bromine, which would typically lead to some kind of addition or substitution. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine (Br2) to a ketone, I think it might undergo a conjugate addition or maybe a bromination. Oh wait, wait! No, wait, I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, bromine could add to the carbonyl group. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Adding bromine under certain conditions usually leads to the formation of a diester or maybe a bromohydrin, but wait, that's when you have an acid catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination via the enol mechanism.

Wait, I think I remember that when ketones react with bromine in a non-polar solvent, it's an example of the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. So, cyclohexanone would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, no, because cyclohexanone has a cyclic structure. Wait, cyclohexanone is (CH2)5CO, so when Br2 adds, I think it would add across the carbonyl group. So adding Br2 to a ketone would result in the formation of a geminal dibromide. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, wait. No, wait. The carbonyl group is O=C-. So when Br2 adds, the carbonyl group (C=O) would become C-Br2-O. Oh wait, no, wait. The carbonyl becomes a geminal dihalide. So cyclohexanone would add Br2 and become 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or is it 1,1-dibromocyclohexane? Wait, no, because the carbonyl is C=O, and when you add Br2,
