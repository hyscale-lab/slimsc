Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I remember that electric potential energy between point charges is calculated using Coulomb's law formula. But wait, I need to think carefully.

The problem states that there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh, right, the elementary charge e is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, which is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, the setup is kind of like a central charge with 12 others around it, each at 2 meters away.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Wait, energy... I think when they talk about the energy of a system of charges, they're referring to the electric potential energy stored in the system. Because that's the energy related to their positions and interactions.

So, to find the total potential energy, I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges. But wait, in a system of multiple charges, each pair contributes to the total. But since the 13th charge is fixed at P, it's the one that all the others are interacting with. Also, the 12 charges are identical and at the same distance from P, so maybe there
