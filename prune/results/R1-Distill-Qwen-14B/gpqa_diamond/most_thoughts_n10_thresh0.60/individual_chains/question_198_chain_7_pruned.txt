Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

Alright, the question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, so these are for complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n is the number of SCN- attached. So β1 is for the monomeric complex, β2 for di, and so on up to tetra?

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. I think dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands. So we're looking for the concentration of the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex relative to all other cobalt species.

I remember the formula for the distribution of species in a complexation reaction. The fraction (or mole fraction) of each species is determined by the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach is to calculate the fraction of each possible complex (from 1 to 4 SCN- attached) and sum them up, then find the percentage for the dithiocyanato (n=2) species.

But wait, how do I model this? I think it's using the equation for each complex, considering the formation step by step.

Let me think. The formation of the complexes can be considered as a stepwise process. Each complex is formed by adding one SCN- at a time.

The fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n / (β_total)) * ([Co] * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum over all f_i terms)

Wait, maybe it's better to approach it with the total concentration of all possible complexes. So, the total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the complex species.

Alternatively, I can model this using the formula:

For each n (from 0 to 4), the fraction f_n is given by (
