Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the problem is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the different cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, cobalt complexes with thiocyanate... I remember that stability constants are about how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β will form more.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the [Co(NCS)_2]^2+ complex. Or is it [Co(NCS)_4]^2-? No, wait, I think the dithiocyanato is [Co(NCS)_2]^2+. Because the options mention 'dithiocyanato' which means two SCN- ligands.

So, the species in solution are various complexes of Co(II) with different numbers of thiocyanate ions. Each complex is Co with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ions. But wait, the β values given are β1 to β4. Oh, perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)_n in different charges. Let me think about the possible complexes.

Wait, the problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, βn is the stability constant for the complex with n thiocyanate ions? Or is it for the step-wise formation? No, I think β is the overall stability constant for the complex with n ligands.

Wait, for a general complex, say Co(SCN)_n, the stability constant βn is given by the formation of that complex. So:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^2+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

Similarly, β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-
