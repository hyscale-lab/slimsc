Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

Astronomers are studying a star with a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2), and how this ratio changes when the star has spots compared to when it doesn't. The observed ratio decreases when spots are present. They want the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, so the ratio decreases when spots are present. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the overall T_eff is lower. So the denominator in the exponent would be lower, making the exponential term larger, which would make the ratio n2/n1 larger. Wait, but that's when the energy levels are such that E2 > E1. Oh wait, but the ratio is n1/n2 or n2/n1? The question says the ratio of level1 to level2 decreases. So let's say the ratio is n1/n2. If this ratio decreases, then n1/n2 is going down, which means n2/n1 is increasing.

So when the star has spots, T is lower. For a given transition (E2 - E1) is fixed, as it's the energy difference for the wavelength given. So when T decreases, the exponential term (which is exp(-delta E/(kT))) increases, because the denominator is smaller. So n2/n1 would increase when T decreases. Thus, the ratio n1/n2 would decrease. Which matches the problem statement.

So the ratio n1/n2 is lower when T is lower (since spots cause T to drop). The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K, with spots, it's 5500 K.

So the ratio when without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T1) ), and with spots, R2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T2) ). The factor is R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) )

Wait, let me think again. Because the ratio is n1/n2. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Wait, because E2 > E1 (since the transition is from higher to lower, emission?), but the energy level difference is E2 - E1. If we have E2 > E1, delta E is positive. So the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T) multiplied by -1. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So n2/n1 is proportional to exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ). So if T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (since (E2-E1) is positive, and T is in denominator), so exp(...) becomes smaller, making n2/n1 smaller. Wait, that's conflicting with earlier thought.

Wait I might have messed up. Let me clarify:

The Boltzmann equation is (n_j / n_i) = (g_j / g_i) * exp( - (E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

In our case, j is level 2 and i is level 1. So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So if E2 > E1, then (E2-E1) is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent's denominator is smaller, making the exponent larger (more negative?), no wait: - (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative when T decreases, because denominator is T, and T is going down. So the exponent becomes more negative, so exp of that becomes smaller. So (n2/n1) decreases when T decreases. Therefore, the ratio (n1/n2) increases. Because (n1/n2) is the inverse of (n2/n1), so if (n2/n1) gets smaller, (n1/n2) gets bigger.

Wait the problem says the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. That would mean that when T is lower (5500 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T was 6000 K. But according to my earlier calculation, if T decreases, (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1). If (n2/n1) decreases, then (n1/n2) increases. So that's a contradiction.
