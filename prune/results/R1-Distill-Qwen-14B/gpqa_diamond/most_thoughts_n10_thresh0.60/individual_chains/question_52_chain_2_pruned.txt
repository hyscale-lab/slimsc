Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star doesn't have any dark spots on its surface, its Teff (effective temperature) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So the star is cooler when it has spots. 

The problem then talks about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature and their respective energies. 

The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, E_i and E_j are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem gives us a specific transition wavelength corresponding to the energy difference between these two levels: 1448 Å, which is about 144.8 nm. That's in the UV range. So the energy difference (E2 - E1) can be found using the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

Let me calculate that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and c is 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters, or 1.448 x 10^-7 meters. Plugging into E = hc/λ:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3.0e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)
Let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divided by 1.448e-7 m gives 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but that's per photon. To get the energy difference in terms of temperature or something else, maybe I should convert it into eV, which might be easier for calculations. Oh right, because Boltzmann's constant is in eV/K terms.

Alternatively, I can compute the energy in terms of eV. Let's see, 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is (1.372e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 8.56 eV. Wait, that seems a bit high, but okay.

Wait a second, wait. Let me re-calculate that because 1448 Å is about 144.8 nm, which is in the UV. Let me compute it again accurately.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
λ = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7)
= (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7)
= (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18
≈ 1.372 * 1e-18 J.

Now, to convert J to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So E = (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Hmm, but maybe that's correct for UV transitions.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check the wavelength: 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is correct. So E = hc/λ, yes. So 8.56 eV is what I get. Hmm, but that's a big energy difference. Well, maybe it's correct.

But wait, another approach: the ionization energy for Ti is around 7.1 eV for neutral Ti (I think), but that's for ionization, not the transition between two levels. So perhaps the transition is within the atom, so 8.56 eV is plausible?

Hmm, perhaps. Okay, moving on.

The ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels (n1/n2) is given by (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ). Wait, wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where E_i is the higher energy level. So if level 2 is higher than level 1, E2 > E1, so E_i is level 2, E_j is level 1.

So the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -(E1 - E2)/(kT) ) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Wait, no, because E1 is lower than E2, so (E1-E2) is negative.

Wait, the correct formula is (n_j)/(n_i) = (g_j/g_i) exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of particles in two states is:

n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i) / (k T) )

So if E_j > E_i, then E_j - E_i is positive, so the exponential is exp( - (something positive) / (k T) ), which is a small number. So n_j is less than n_i.

In our problem, when the star has spots, the temperature decreases. So the question is, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 (n1 is level 1, n2 level 2) is lower. So when the star is cooler, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, wait. No, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and when with spots, 5500 K. The ratio n1/n2 is higher when it's 6000 K than when it's 5500 K.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says the ratio
