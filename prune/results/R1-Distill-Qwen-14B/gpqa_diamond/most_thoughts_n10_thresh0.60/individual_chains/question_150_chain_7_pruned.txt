Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. So, let's start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's see, for each molecule, the degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, substituting the values: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. Wait, X is 0 here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, I think I forgot that N is treated as a double bond equivalent. Oh wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1.

So, 2*8 is 16, plus 2 is 18. Minus H (9) is 9. Plus N (1) is 10. Now divide by 2: 5. Oh, so 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes sense because each double bond or ring is one, each triple bond is two, etc. So 5 could mean like a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds, so 3 degrees) plus a double bond (another degree) and a ring or another double bond. Or maybe a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde or ketone) which is another double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: 

1H NMR (ppm):
- 9.72 (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's probably an aldehyde proton (since aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm), but wait, it's a triplet. Aldehydes are usually singlets unless coupled with something. Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic ring with ortho coupling? Or perhaps it's an enol form, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde group adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's part of an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde? Like a conjugated system. So a triplet might come from coupling with two adjacent protons, like if it's CH2-CHO maybe. Or perhaps it's a coupling with two neighboring groups.

Wait, what about a benzaldehyde derivative? If the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group that has two protons, then the aldehyde proton could split into a triplet. Or it might be part of a coupling with neighboring protons in a different way.

Next, 6.98 (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for 2H. That seems like two protons in an aromatic ring, perhaps as a para-substituted group. Like two protons in a para
