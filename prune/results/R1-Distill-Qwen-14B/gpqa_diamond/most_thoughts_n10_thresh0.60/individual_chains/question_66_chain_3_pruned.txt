Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Hmm, from what I remember, SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it's built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model Lagrangian. But when you add these operators, they must respect certain symmetries of the Standard Model. 

Wait, the Standard Model itself respects certain symmetries. The SM Lagrangian is invariant under Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translation symmetries. Since the SM respects Poincare, I guess the SMEFT operators must also respect that. But wait, does that mean Poincare is a symmetry that SMEFT must respect? Because if the SM does, then the SMEFT, which is an extension, should too.

CP symmetry is another thing. I remember that the SM doesn't respect CP in some cases, like in the CKM matrix where CP violation occurs. So if the SM already violates CP, then the SMEFT operators wouldn't necessarily have to conserve CP either. So would the operators in SMEFT have to respect CP? I think no, because the SM doesn't. Wait, but the question is about symmetries that must be respected by all operators. So if a symmetry is not a part of the SM's fundamental symmetries, then SMEFT operators can violate it?

Wait, but the
