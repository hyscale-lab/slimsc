Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm. Let me draw that structure. So cyclohexanone with a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (so CH2OH attached). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2CHCH2 but attached at the double bond? Or wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)- something? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The prop-1-en-2-yl group would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH(CH2)â€”? No, maybe it's CH2=CH2-CH3 as a substituent. Wait, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as an allyl group, but attached in a specific way. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-
