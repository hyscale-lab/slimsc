Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions where a chemist uses two different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. 

Wait, actually, the products are (R) and (S), but which reaction gives which? Let me check the question again. Oh, right. The first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ giving (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second reaction is B + BH3 + H+ giving (S)-4-ethyl... So the same product but different enantiomers based on the reagents used.

Hmm, so the same product is formed, but the configuration is R or S depending on the starting material and the reducing agent.

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. I remember that LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. Also, in the context of ketone reductions, maybe it's about the mechanism. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, LiBH4 is a borohydride reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes. BH3 is also a borane, but maybe it's used in more specific conditions or for different types of reductions.

Wait, but both are used for ketone reductions
