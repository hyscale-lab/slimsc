Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think I need to count all the atoms first, especially the carbons and hydrogens, because the problem gives me bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. 

Wait, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for organic compounds, that's usually from carbon ( graphite ) and hydrogen gas. 

The formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 
ΔHf = [sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in products]

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the atomization approach. Because sometimes it's easier to think about breaking all bonds in the reactants and forming all bonds in the products.

Oh right, the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) can be calculated as the difference between the energy required to break all bonds in the reactants (elements) and the energy released when forming all bonds in the product molecule.

So the formula is: 
ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of reactants broken) - (Σ bond energies of product bonds formed)

But wait, the reactants here would be elemental carbon and hydrogen gas. Let me think.

Wait, but the problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element to produce atoms. For carbon, that's breaking either a C-C bond (as in graphite) to make atoms. So for a mole of carbon, it's 1000 kJ to atomize.

So maybe the approach is to calculate the total energy needed to atomize all the carbon and hydrogen in the molecule, and then subtract the energy released when they form the bonds in the compound.

Wait, let me structure this correctly. The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, which is an alkene or something with double bonds, I'll need to consider all the bonds broken and formed.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to count the number of each type of bond.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the number of each type of bond in the molecule. Let's break it down.

First, identify all the bonds in the molecule. Each carbon has four bonds, so the molecule's structure will determine how many single and double bonds there are.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of each bond type in the molecule. Let's see.

The molecule's structure: Let me try to parse it.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-: So, that's a (CH3)2C=CH- group. The central carbon has two CH3 groups and a double bond to a CH.

Then, after that, it's connected to a CH2- group.

Then another CH(CH3)- group.

Then another CH2-.

Then a CH=C(CH3)2 group.

So maybe let's count all the C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has the following:

Each (CH3) group is a methyl group. So let's count the number of each type of bond.

But maybe it's easier to first determine the molecular formula of the compound. Because that might help in counting the number of each bond type.

The given formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C and H in each part.

Each (CH3) is CH3, which is C:1, H:3.

First group: (CH3)2C=CH: So, 2*(1 C) + 1 C (the central C) + 1 C (from CH) = 4 C. For H: 2*(3 H) + 3 (from CH) = 6 +3 =9 H.

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps adding up the entire formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula can be simplified. Let me write the molecular formula.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- group: that's ((CH3)2C=CH-): which is (C4 H7). Wait:

(CH3)2C=CH- is (C(3) (each CH3 is 1 C, so two CH3 is 2 C) + the central C is another, and the CH is another. So 4 C. H: each CH3 has 3 H, so 2*3=6, the central C has (assuming it's connected to two CH3 and a double bond to CH), so maybe the CH has 1 H.

Wait, perhaps that's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can count all the C and H in the entire molecule.

Let me parse each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : has 4 C (2 from (CH3)2, 1 from C, and 1 from CH). H: each CH3 has 3 H, so 2*3=6, and the CH has 1 H. So total H here is 7.

2. Then, the next part is -CH2- : which is CH2. So 1 C, 2 H.

3. Then, -CH(CH3)-: which is CH(CH3). So 2 C (1 from CH, 1 from CH3). H: 3 (from CH) plus 3 (from CH3) = 6 H.

Wait, no. Wait, CH(CH3): the central C is connected to another CH3, so the structure is CH(CH3). So the C has two H (from CH) and the CH3. So total H: 2 + 3 =5? Or maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps each CH(CH3) group has 4 H: because the central C is connected to 3 H and one CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: CH(CH3) would have a central C connected to another CH3, and two H. Wait, no, no, for CH(CH3), the structure is CH2-CH(CH3), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to write out the entire molecular formula.

Wait, maybe I should approach this systematically.

The entire formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of carbons:

Each (CH3) group is 1 C. So:

- The first (CH3)2C=CH- contributes 4 C (two from (CH3), one from C, one from CH).

- The next CH2- is 1 C.

- The CH(CH3)- is 2 C (the CH and the CH3).

- The next CH2- is 1 C.

- The CH=C(CH3)2 part: the CH has 1 C, the C= has another C, and each CH3 is 1 C, so that's 1 + 1 + 2*(1) = 4 C.

Wait, maybe I'm making this too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should count each C and H in the entire formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C14H22 or something similar. Let me try to count.

Each (CH3) group contributes 1 C and 3 H. So:

Looking at the formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH: here, each (CH3) is 1 C, so that's 2 C. The central C is another. Then CH is another C. So that's 2 + 1 + 1 =4 C. H: each CH3 has 3 H, so 2×3=6. Then the CH has 1 H. So 6 +1=7 H.

Then, the next part is CH2: that's 1 C, 2 H.

Then CH(CH3): so 1 C (the CH), and another C from CH3. So 2 C. H: the CH has 2 H, and the CH3 has 3 H. So 2 +3=5 H.

Then CH2: 1 C, 2 H.

Then CH: 1 C, 1 H.

Then =C(CH3)2: the C is connected to two CH3 groups. So 1 C, and each CH3 is 1 C, so 1 + 2×1=3 C. H: each CH3 has 3 H, so 2×3=6 H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all C and H.

Let me go step by step:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - 2 (from CH3) + 1 (C) + 1 (CH) =4 C
   - 2×3 (CH3) =6 H, plus 1 (CH) =7 H

2. -CH2-:
   - 1 C
   - 2 H

3. -CH(CH3)-:
   - 1 C (CH) +1 C (CH3) =2 C
   - 2 H (CH) +3 H (CH3) =5 H

4. -CH2-:
   -1 C
   -2 H

5. -CH=C(CH3)2:
   - 1 C (CH) +1 C (C) + 2×1 C (each CH3) =4 C
   - 1 H (CH) + 2×3 H (each CH3) =7 H

Wait, but the CH=C(CH3)2 part: the C has a double bond to another C, which is connected to two CH3 groups. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2, but with a double bond. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule is:

The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, then connected to CH2, then CH(CH3), then CH2, then CH-C(CH3)2, but with a double bond in the middle.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of C is 14.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that I'm getting stuck on counting and think of an alternative approach. Maybe the problem is more about knowing the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies, regardless of the exact structure.

Wait, the problem gives me the bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, and H-H. Also, the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So, perhaps the approach is to consider the bonds in the molecule and calculate the total energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (which are elements: graphite and H2) and then subtract the energy released when the product bonds form.

So, the formula is: ΔHf = [Σ (bonds broken in reactants)] - [Σ (bonds formed in product)].

But the reactants are elemental carbon and hydrogen gas. So, the bonds broken in the reactants would be the C-C bonds in graphite and the H-H bonds in H2.

Wait, but each mole of carbon in graphite has a certain number of C-C bonds. So, for a given number of moles of the compound, I need to find how many C-C bonds are broken.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The enthalpy of formation of the compound can be calculated using the atomization method. The steps are:

1. Break all bonds in the reactants (elements) into their atoms.
2. Form all bonds in the compound.

So, the enthalpy change is the energy required for step 1 minus the energy released in step 2.

So, for a molecule, the equation is:

ΔHf = [ (number of C atoms × enthalpy of atomization of C)/moles ] + [ (number of H atoms × enthalpy of atomization of H)/moles ] - [ sum of bond energies for all bonds in the molecule ]

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula is:

ΔHf = [ (Σ atoms in molecule × enthalpy of atomization per atom) ] - [ Σ bond energies of all bonds in molecule ]

Wait, but let me think again. Each bond in the reactants (elements) is broken to form atoms. Then, these atoms form the bonds in the product.

So, the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds broken (to make atoms) minus the sum of the bond energies of the product bonds formed.

So, for the molecule, the number of C atoms and H atoms would be determined by the molecular formula.

Let me denote the molecule as CxHy.

So, the number of C atoms is x, and each requires 1000 kJ/mol to atomize.

The number of H atoms is y, and each H is from H2, so each H-H bond is 100 kJ/mol. So for y H atoms, the number of H2 molecules would be y/2, so the bond energy for breaking H-H is (y/2) × 100 kJ/mol.

But wait, each H2 molecule has 1 bond. So for y H atoms, we have y H atoms, which come from (y/2) H2 molecules. Each H2 has a bond energy of 100 kJ/mol, so the total energy to break all H-H bonds is (y/2) × 100 kJ.

Similarly, for C, each mole of C has a certain number of C-C bonds. Let me think, how many C-C bonds are in a mole of graphite? Because graphite is a 2D lattice of hexagons, so each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two C atoms. So per mole, the number of C-C bonds is 3/2 × Avogadro's number. But wait, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol. So that's the energy to break all bonds in a mole of C (graphite) to make atoms.

So, for x moles of C, the energy required to atomize them is x × 1000 kJ.

Now, the bonds in the product (the molecule) are a combination of C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

So the sum of the bond energies for all bonds in the molecule would be:

sum = (number of C-C bonds × 200) + (number of C=C bonds × 300) + (number of C-H bonds × 400)

Because each C-C bond is 200 kJ, each C=C is 300, and each C-H is 400.

So the formula for ΔHf is:

ΔHf = [ (x × 1000) + (y/2 × 100) ] - [ (sum of C-C and C=C and C-H bonds) ]

Now, to proceed, I need to know x (number of C atoms) and y (number of H atoms) in the molecule, as well as the number of each type of bond.

Wait, but perhaps the molecule's molecular formula isn't given. But looking at the given options, the numeric answers are either in kJ/mol or kJ/g. Hmm.

Wait, the options are:

A) 11200 kJ/mol
B)67.4 kJ/mol
C)11.44 kJ/g
D)1900 kJ/g

So the units are either per mole or per gram. The problem asks for the enthalpy of formation in what units? The question says "calculate the enthalpy of formation of (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2", but the options are in kJ/mol and kJ/g.

But the given data is per mole (kJ/mol), so the answer should be in kJ/mol. Options A and B are in kJ/mol, C and D in kJ/g.

So probably the correct answer is among A or B.

Now, I need to find the molecular formula of the given compound.

Let me write out the formula again.

The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of C and H atoms.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3) group is a CH3, which is 1 C and 3 H.

Looking at each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: So, 2 CH3 groups, 1 C in the center, and 1 CH group.

- C count: 2 +1 +1 =4
- H count: 2×3 =6 (from CH3) + 1 (from CH)=7

2. Then, -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.

3. -CH(CH3)-: 1 CH group (1 C, 1 H), and 1 CH3 (1 C, 3 H). So 1 +1 =2 C, 1 +3 =4 H.

4. -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.

5. -CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C in CH, 1 C in the double bond, and 2 CH3 groups (2 C, 3×2=6 H). So C: 1 +1 + 2 =4. H: 1 (from CH) + 6 =7.

Wait, let me check each part again.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 2*(CH3) = 2 C, 1 C (center), and 1 C (CH) → 4 C. H: 2*3=6 + 1=7.

2. -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.

3. -CH(CH3)-: 1 C (CH), 1 C (CH3) → 2 C. H: 2 (from CH?) Wait, CH has one H? No: CH has one C connected to one H. So CH has one H. CH(CH3) has 1 H (from CH) plus 3 from CH3 → 4 H.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the H count wrong. Let me re-express each part.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me count all C and H in the entire formula.

1. The first (CH3)2C=CH- group:

- (CH3)2: 2 C, 6 H
- C: 1 C, 0 H (since it's part of a double bond)
- =CH-: 1 C, 1 H
So total for this part: 2+1+1=4 C, 6 +1=7 H.

2. Next part: -CH2- → 1 C, 2 H.

3. Next: -CH(CH3)- → this is a CH connected to a CH3.

- CH: 1 C, 1 H
- CH3: 1 C, 3 H
So total: 2 C, 4 H.

4. -CH2- → 1 C, 2 H.

5. -CH=C(CH3)2 → this is a CH group connected via double bond to a C(CH3)2.

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.
- =C(CH3)2: 1 C, each CH3 is 1 C, 3 H. So 1 C (the central C) + 2×1 C (from CH3) = 3 C. H: 2×3=6 H.

Wait, but the CH=C(CH3)2 is one C connected via double bond to another C, which has two CH3 groups.

So that's 1 C (CH) + 1 C (double bond) + 2×1 C (each CH3) → 4 C.

H: 1 (from CH) + 2×3 (each CH3) → 7 H.

So adding all parts:

C count:

1. 4 C
2. 1 C
3. 2 C
4. 1 C
5. 4 C
Total C: 4+1+2+1+4=12 C.

H count:

1. 7 H
2. 2 H
3. 4 H
4. 2 H
5. 7 H
Total H: 7+2=9; 9+4=13; 13+2=15; 15+7=22 H.

So molecular formula is C12H22.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me recount.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the last part.

In step 5, the CH=C(CH3)2 part:

The CH has 1 C, 1 H.

The C= part is double bonded to another C, which has two CH3 groups. So that C has 2 CH3 → 2 C and 6 H.

So for step 5:

C: 1 (CH) +1 (C=) + 2×1 (each CH3) = 4 C.

H: 1 (CH) + 6 (from CH3 groups) =7 H.

So adding up:

Part 1: 4 C, 7 H.

Part 2: 1 C, 2 H.

Part 3: 2 C, 4 H.

Part4: 1 C, 2 H.

Part5:4 C,7 H.

Adding C: 4+1=5; +2=7; +1=8; +4=12 C.

H:7+2=9; +4=13; +2=15; +7=22 H.

So the molecular formula is C12H22.

Wait, wait. But the formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the C and H another way.

Each CH3 group is 1 C, 3 H.

How many CH3 groups are there?

Looking at the formula:

- (CH3)2 → 2 CH3 groups (so 2×3=6 H)
- Then, CH2 groups: each has 2 H.
- CH groups: each has 1 H.
- etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think that the formula is C12H22.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to note that the formula has 12 C and 22 H.

So x=12, y=22.

Now, going back to the formula:

ΔHf = [ (x × 1000) + (y/2 × 100) ] - [ sum of bond energies in the molecule ]

So, x=12, y=22.

So:

Energy to atomize C: 12 × 1000 = 12,000 kJ.

Energy to break H-H bonds: (22/2) ×100 =11 ×100=1,100 kJ.

Total energy for reactants: 12,000 +1,100 =13,100 kJ.

Now, the bond energies in the molecule.

The molecule has C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds.

I need to find the number of each type of bond.

Let me think about the structure again.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each C=C double bond is one bond, but in terms of bond energy, it's considered as one bond of 300 kJ.

Wait, no. Each C=C is a double bond, but in bond energy terms, it's considered as one bond of 300 kJ because that's the energy to break one C=C bond.

Wait, no, bond energy is per bond. So each single bond is one unit, each double bond is one unit but higher energy.

Wait, in bond energy calculations for enthalpy of formation, each type of bond contributes based on its type and count. So for each C-C single bond, it's 200 kJ. Each C=C is 300 kJ. Each C-H is 400 kJ.

So now, I need to count the number of each bond in the molecule.

Let me go step by step.

First, identify each bond in the molecule.

The molecule has the following structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down into parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: includes a C=C double bond.

2. -CH2-: single bonds.

3. -CH(CH3)-: single bonds.

4. -CH2-: single bonds.

5. -CH=C(CH3)2: another C=C double bond.

So, let's count each bond type.

First, double bonds:

- There are two C=C double bonds in the molecule.

Each C=C is one bond, so two in total.

Each contributes 300 kJ, so 2 × 300 =600 kJ.

Now, single bonds:

We need to count all C-C and C-H bonds.

Let's structure the molecule as a chain and count each bond.

The structure can be represented as:

CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

Wait, perhaps I should write this as a series of connected carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to count all the single bonds.

Each carbon (except the ends) is connected to two other carbons, but not all are single bonds.

Wait, but each single bond is a C-C or C-H.

Let me try to count all the single bonds.

Each CH3 group has three C-H bonds.

Each CH2 has two C-H bonds.

Each CH has one C-H bond.

Additionally, the C-C bonds between the carbons.

Let me try to count the C-C (single) bonds.

The molecule has a structure where each C is connected to adjacent C(s) via single or double bonds.

Let me list all the C-C bonds.

The molecule has:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

So, the chain is:

C(CH3)2 connected to C via double bond → CH connected to CH2 → CH2 connected to CH(CH3) → CH2 connected to CH → C connected to CH3 groups via double bond.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 10 single C-C bonds and 2 double C=C bonds.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the molecule as a series of connected carbons.

The molecule has 12 carbons. Let's number them from left to right as C1 to C12.

C1 is connected to two CH3 groups and a double bond to C2.

C2 is double bonded to C1 and single bonded to C3.

C3 is single bonded to C2 and C4.

C4 is single bonded to C3 and C5.

C5 is single bonded to C4 and C6.

C6 is single bonded to C5 and C7.

C7 is single bonded to C6 and C8.

C8 is double bonded to C9, which is connected to two CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way. Let me try to list each C and its connections.

But perhaps that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of C-C single bonds and C-H bonds.

Each (CH3) group contributes three C-H bonds.

Each CH2 group contributes two C-H bonds.

Each CH group contributes one C-H bond.

Each C=C contributes no C-H bonds on the carbons involved in the double bond.

Let me count the number of C-H bonds.

In the molecule:

- The first (CH3)2C=CH- group: two CH3 groups (each 3 C-H) → 2×3=6. The CH has 1 C-H. So 6 +1=7.

- The -CH2- group: 2 C-H.

- The -CH(CH3)- group: the CH has 1 C-H, and the CH3 has 3 C-H. So 4.

- The next -CH2-: 2 C-H.

- The -CH=C(CH3)2 group: the CH has 1 C-H. The two CH3 groups on the double-bonded C have 3 each → 6. So 1 +6=7.

Total C-H bonds: 7 (first part) +2 +4 +2 +7=22.

So the molecule has 22 C-H bonds.

Each C-H bond contributes 400 kJ, so 22 ×400 =8,800 kJ.

Now, the C-C bonds.

Each single C-C bond contributes 200 kJ.

We need to count how many single C-C bonds there are.

In the molecule, there are 12 carbons. Each is connected to others.

Total number of C-C bonds can be determined by the number of single bonds plus the number of double bonds (since each double bond is one C=C bond, which is treated separately).

Each double bond is one bond.

So, the molecule has 12 carbons connected in a chain, so normally, there would be 11 single bonds, but some are double bonds.

Wait, the molecule has two double bonds (each C=C). So the number of C-C single bonds is 11 (the number in a straight chain) minus the number of double bonds (each double bond takes the place of a single bond and adds another bond, but in terms of counting C-C bonds, each double bond is one bond).

Wait, no. Let me think about it differently. Each double bond is a single C=C bond, but counts as one bond. So the total number of C-C bonds is the number of single bonds plus the number of double bonds.

In a straight chain of 12 carbons, there are 11 single C-C bonds. But in this molecule, two of those are double bonds.

So, the number of C-C single bonds is 11 - 2 =9.

So, the number of C-C single bonds is 9.

Each contributes 200 kJ, so 9 ×200=1,800 kJ.

Adding the C=C bonds: 2 ×300=600 kJ.

And the C-H bonds: 22 ×400=8,800 kJ.

So the sum of all bonds in the molecule is 1,800 +600 +8,800= 11,200 kJ.

Now, going back to the ΔHf calculation.

ΔHf = [12×1000 + (22/2)×100 ] - [sum of bonds in product]

= [12,000 +1,100] - [11,200]

= 13,100 -11,200 =1,900 kJ/mol.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no, because the sum of bonds in the product is the sum of all the bond energies, which is 11,200 kJ.

So ΔHf = 13,100 -11,200 = 1,900 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 11200 kJ/mol, which doesn't match. But wait, my calculation gives 1900 kJ/mol. Looking at the options, option A is 11200, option B is 67.4, which is nowhere near 1900. So, what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the bond counts.

Wait, let me recount the C-C bonds.

Another approach: the molecule has 12 carbons. The number of single C-C bonds plus double bonds equals the number of C-C bonds.

In a chain, between 12 C, there are 11 C-C bonds. Some are single, some are double.

In this molecule, there are two double C=C bonds. So, the number of single C-C bonds would be 11 - 2 =9.

But wait, each double bond is a double bond, so it's one C=C bond, not two C-C bonds. So the number of C-C bonds, whether single or double, is 11 (12 carbons in a chain gives 11 C-C bonds), but two are double bonds (C=C), and the rest are single.

So the total C-C bonds (single and double) is 11.

But when calculating bond energies, each C-C single bond contributes 200 kJ, each C=C contributes 300 kJ.

So the sum of C-C bonds is:

Number of single bonds ×200 + number of double bonds ×300.

Earlier, I thought the number of single C-C bonds is 9, but if two are double bonds, then 9 single and 2 double.

So 9×200 =1,800, 2×300=600 → 2,400.

Plus C-H bonds: 22×400=8,800.

So total bonds: 2,400 +8,800=11,200.

So the sum is correct.

So back to ΔHf: 13,100 -11,200=1,900 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 11,200, which is the sum of bond energies, not the ΔHf.

Option B is 67.4, which is nothing like 1900.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I have an error in the formula. Because the enthalpy of atomization is 1000 kJ per mole of C. But when you atomize one mole of C, you're breaking the bonds in one mole of C. So for x moles of C in the molecule, it's x ×1000.

Wait, but wait, the molecule is C12H22. So one mole of the molecule contains 12 moles of C atoms and 22 moles of H atoms.

So, the energy to atomize C: 12 ×1000 kJ/mol.

Energy to break H-H bonds: (22/2) ×100 kJ/mol → 11 ×100=1,100.

So, 12,000 +1,100=13,100.

Sum of bond energies in the molecule:11,200.

ΔHf =13,100 -11,200 = 1,900 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, option A is 11,200, which is the sum of bond energies, but the question asks for the enthalpy of formation, which is 1,900.

Wait, but none of the options is 1900. Oh wait, option B is 67.4, which is nowhere near. So that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula.

Wait, looking back, I thought the formula is C12H22, but perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let me recount the H.

Each CH3 has 3 H.

In the formula:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count H again.

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:

   2 CH3 → 6 H

   CH → 1 H

   Total:7 H.

2. -CH2-: 2 H.

3. -CH(CH3)-: CH has 1 H, CH3 has 3 H → 4 H.

4. -CH2-:2 H.

5. -CH=C(CH3)2:

   CH →1 H.

   Each CH3 →3 H, two →6 H.

   Total:1+6=7 H.

So adding:7+2=9, +4=13, +2=15, +7=22. So H=22.

C: earlier calculation: 12.

So the formula is indeed C12H22.

So why is the enthalpy of formation 1,900 kJ/mol, but the options don't have this?

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 11200 kJ/mol → which is the sum of bond energies.

B)67.4 kJ/mol.

C)11.44 kJ/g.

D)1900 kJ/g.

Wait, option D is 1900 kJ/g. Oh, but I was looking for per mole. Did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, the problem says "calculate the enthalpy of formation", and the options have units of kJ/g and kJ/mol.

So perhaps, I should calculate the molar mass first to get the answer in kJ/g.

Wait, the molar mass of C12H22 is:

12 ×12 g/mol (C) +22 ×1 g/mol (H) →144 +22=166 g/mol.

So 1,900 kJ/mol is equivalent to 1,900 /166 ≈11.44 kJ/g.

Looking at the options, option C is 11.44 kJ/g. That matches.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait, why did I get 1,900 kJ/mol, which is option D if it were per gram. But option D is 1900 kJ/g, which is way too high, because 1,900 kJ per mole is about 11 kJ/g.

So option C is 11.44 kJ/g, which matches.

So the correct answer is C.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following steps were taken:

### 1. **Determine the molecular formula**
The molecular formula of the compound was determined by counting the number of carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms in the structure. The formula is **C₁₂H₂₂**.

### 2. **Calculate the total energy required to break bonds in the reactants**
The reactants are elemental carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). The energy required to break the bonds in the reactants is calculated as:
- **Energy to atomize carbon**:  
  Each mole of carbon requires 1000 kJ/mol to break its bonds. For 12 moles of carbon:  
  \[
  12 \times 1000 = 12,000 \, \text{kJ}
  \]
- **Energy to break H-H bonds**:  
  Each mole of H₂ has one H-H bond with bond energy 100 kJ/mol. For 22 H atoms (11 H₂ molecules):  
  \[
  \frac{22}{2} \times 100 = 1,100 \, \text{kJ}
  \]
- **Total energy for reactants**:  
  \[
  12,000 + 1,100 = 13,100 \, \text{kJ}
  \]

### 3. **Calculate the total energy released when forming bonds in the product**
The bonds in the product are analyzed as follows:
- **C=C double bonds**: There are 2 double bonds, each with bond energy 300 kJ:  
  \[
  2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ}
  \]
- **C-C single bonds**: There are 9 single bonds, each with bond energy 200 kJ:  
  \[
  9 \times 200 = 1,800 \, \text{kJ}
  \]
- **C-H bonds**: There are 22 C-H bonds, each with bond energy 400 kJ:  
  \[
  22 \times 400 = 8,800 \, \text{kJ}
  \]
- **Total energy for bonds in the product**:  
  \[
  600 + 1,800 + 8,800 = 11,200 \, \text{kJ}
  \]

### 4. **Calculate the enthalpy of formation**
The enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the reactant bonds minus the energy released when forming the product bonds:  
\[
\Delta H_f = [13,100] - [11,200] = 1,900 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### 5. **Convert to energy per gram**
The molar mass of the compound is:  
\[
12 \times 12 + 22 \times 1 = 144 + 22 = 166 \, \text{g/mol}
\]
The energy per gram is:  
\[
\frac{1,900}{166} \approx 11.44 \, \text{kJ/g}
\]

### 6. **Match with the options**
- **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol)**: This is the total bond energy of the product, not the enthalpy of formation.  
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This is incorrect.  
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)**: This matches the calculated energy per gram.  
- **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: This is incorrect as it misrepresents the units.

### Final Answer:
The correct answer is **C**, as it matches the calculated energy per gram.  
**Answer: C**
