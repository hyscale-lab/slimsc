Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Each particle is in a tube, moving along the x-axis. The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the positions, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So I need to find 'a' such that the probability of finding the particle outside this region is zero.

Wait, but wait. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, I remember that the wave function needs to be normalized because the total probability must be 1. Also, the wave function should be zero outside the region where the particle exists. Because if the particle is only found between 1 and 3, perhaps the wave function is zero elsewhere, but here it's given in that form. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. The way it's written, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But for a valid wave function, it must be square-integrable, meaning the integral of |Ïˆ|^2 over all space must be finite. But wait, the problem says that when they measured, particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is non-zero only in that interval
