Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and the concept of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level for star_1 is higher. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we need to find the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower) / (k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights. But in this problem, they're talking about the same energy levels for the two stars, so perhaps the statistical weights are the same for both stars. So maybe the ratio simplifies.

Wait, but the question is about excitation in a specific level, so perhaps the ratio is about the population of that level. Let me think. Suppose the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. Then the ratio of excited states (E2) to lower (E1) is proportional to exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). 

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, for star_1, the population ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is 2 times that of star_2. Let me write that down.

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower )

But since both are in LTE, the ratios are given by the Boltzmann factor. So let me write the Boltzmann equations for each star.

For star_1: (n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (n2_upper / n2_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - ΔE/(k T2) )

Since the question says the excitation is twice as high in star_1, that means n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower )

So plugging those equations in:

(g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * [ (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ]

The (g_upper/g_lower) terms cancel out, since they're same for both stars, as the energy level difference is the same. So we get:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Hmm, let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

ln( exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) = ln( 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Simplify the left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) )

Which becomes: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Wait, because ln(exp(x)) is x. So,

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - (ΔE)/(k T2)

Let me rearrange this equation to collect terms. Let's bring the ΔE/(k T2) term to the left.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let me compute the terms inside the [ ].

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ( -T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2) )

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, -1/T1 + 1/T2 = ( -T2 + T1 )/( T1 T2 )

Which is ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 )

So substituting back:

(ΔE)/(k) * ( T1 - T2 )/( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

But wait, the question says that the energy difference ΔE is positive, since it's given as 1.38e-23 J. So I think that's correct.

But wait, wait, let me think again. Let's check the algebra.

Starting from:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Bringing terms with ΔE to the left:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2 )

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] = ln(2 )

Which is:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1)/( T1 T2 ) ) ] = ln(2 )

So, (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T2 - T1) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Alternatively, since (T2 - T1) is negative if T2 < T1, but in our case, star_1 has higher excitation, which implies higher temperature, I think.

Wait, because a higher temperature would lead to higher populations in the excited state. Because with higher T, the exponential term is less negative, so the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) is higher.

So in the given problem, star_1 has twice the excitation as star_2, which implies that T1 > T2.

So if T1 > T2, then (T2 - T1) is negative. So in the equation:

(ΔE/(k)) * ( (T2 - T1) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Which becomes:

ΔE/(k) * (- (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So,

-ΔE/(k) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ΔE/(k) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = - ln(2 )

But wait, this would imply that the LHS is negative, but ΔE is positive, and (T1-T2) is positive since T1 > T2. So the LHS is positive, which can't be equal to -ln(2) which is negative.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake here. Let me double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, let's go back to the equation after taking logs:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Let me rearrange this equation.

Bring all terms to one side:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) - ln(2) = 0

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/T1 + 1/T2 ] - ln(2) = 0

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2 )

Wait, because:

-1/(T1) + 1/(T2) = ( - T2 + T1 )/( T1 T2 )

Which is (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

Wait, yes, so:

ΔE/(k T1 T2) ( T1 - T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

So,

(ΔE/(k)) * ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, but looking at our earlier equation, this is:

(ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, so the equation we have is ln(2) equals (ΔE/k) multiplied by (T1-T2)/(T1 T2 )

But in the options, none of them directly have ΔE. But perhaps we can express it in terms of the temperatures.

Wait, what's the value of ΔE/(k)? Let me compute that. The given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, k is the Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE/(k) would be (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Oh! So ΔE/(k) is equal to 1 K.

So substituting that into our equation:

ln(2) = [ 1 K ] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

So,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which can be rewritten as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Option D is correct.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, and the energy difference between the energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J. Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( g_{\text{upper}} \) and \( g_{\text{lower}} \) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. Since the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2, we have:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_1} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} \bigg|_{\text{star}_2}.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann expressions for each star:

\[
\frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \frac{g_{\text{upper}}}{g_{\text{lower}}} \) from both sides:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), and the energy difference \( \Delta E \) is also \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
