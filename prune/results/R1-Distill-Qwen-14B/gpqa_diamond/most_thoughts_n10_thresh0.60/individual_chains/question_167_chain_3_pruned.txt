Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix similar to a Gaussian distribution, like coherent states or squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states are more exotic, like cat states, which are superpositions of coherent states. The problem gives me a specific state and asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy method.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N, where N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). The relative entropy measure is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

The question gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity for these parameters.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think. Non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. The relative entropy method compares the state's entropy to that of the nearest Gaussian state. So, if the state is Gaussian, nG would be zero.

First, I need to find the density matrices rho and tau. Then compute the relative entropy.

Wait, but what's the reference Gaussian state tau? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe tau is the Gaussian state closest to rho, or perhaps it's a specific Gaussian state that is the best approximation in some sense. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, making it the optimal approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the state obtained by taking the Gaussian part of rho. Since |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. The density matrix rho for |psi> would be a pure state, but tau would be a mixed Gaussian state?

Or maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, which would be the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in terms of quantum relative entropy.

Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics of the reference state tau. Maybe I should look for a way to compute the relative entropy between rho and tau, where tau is a certain Gaussian state.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps for a pure state like |psi>, the reference Gaussian state is the one that has the same first and second moments as |psi>. Because for Gaussian states, the first and second moments (like mean and covariance) define the state. So, if I compute the first and second moments of |psi> and then construct the Gaussian state with those moments, that would be the reference tau.

Let me think about that. For a coherent state |alpha>, the density matrix is a pure Gaussian state. The state |psi> here is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it non-Gaussian. The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, but not Gaussian.

The reference Gaussian state tau would have the same first moments (like mean photon number, or something like that) and the same second
