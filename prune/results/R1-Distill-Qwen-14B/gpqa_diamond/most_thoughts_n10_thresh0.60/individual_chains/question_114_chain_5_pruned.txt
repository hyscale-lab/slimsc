Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem has two reactions. The first one is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents A and B. I need to figure out which combination is correct.

Hmm, okay, let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN-, it's probably undergoing some kind of nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would typically form a cyanohydrin. Yes, cyanohydrin formation! That's when a carbonyl group reacts with CN- in a nucleophilic addition, followed by acid work-up to protonate the oxygen, right?

So, the reaction of a ketone with cyanide ion (from NaCN) produces a cyanohydrin. But for that, I think the reaction is done under acidic conditions. Because the mechanism involves the deprotonation of the alpha hydrogen, which would require an acid catalyst.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The cyanide ion is a strong nucleophile. When you add it to a ketone, it adds to the carbonyl carbon, creating an alkoxide which then gets protonated. But wait, the initial step is the attack by CN- on the carbonyl, forming an intermediate that's then protonated. But for the work-up, you need an acid to protonate the oxygen. Because the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group.

So, the reagent A is probably an acid. But which acid? The options are either H3O+ or NaHSO3, which is another acid.

Looking at the options, for reagent A, the choices are H3
