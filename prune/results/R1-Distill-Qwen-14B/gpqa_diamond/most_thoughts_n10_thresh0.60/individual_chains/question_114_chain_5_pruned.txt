Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait. Butan-2-one is a ketone. I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide can undergo some kind of addition. Oh right, the formation of cyanohydrins! Cyanohydrin formation involves the addition of cyanide to a carbonyl group. The reaction is typically done in a slightly acidic condition because the cyanide ion is a weak nucleophile and needs some acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic.

So, for the first step, the reaction is between a ketone and NaCN. The product is a cyanohydrin. The reagent A must be an acid because, without it, the reaction might not proceed efficiently. So A is probably something like H3O+ or maybe another acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A. Options C and D have NaHSO3 as A.

Wait, but wait. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-. Could it act as an acid? Yes, but why would it be used here? Alternatively, maybe it's for something else, like a different kind of reaction. But the first reaction is a cyanohydrin formation, which usually uses an acid catalyst like HCl, H2SO4, or H3O+.

So if A is H3O+, that makes sense. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. Options C and D have A as NaHSO3, which I'm less sure about. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, in some cases, when you have a ketone and you're adding NaCN, you might need to generate HCN. Wait, no, NaCN is already providing the cyanide. So the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, so the CN-
