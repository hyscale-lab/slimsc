Okay, so I've got this problem here about a supermassive black hole and finding the order of magnitude of its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the entropy of the black hole. The options are A to D, all around 1e59 to 1e66 J/K.

Wait, entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, right? So the formula is S = (Ac^3)/(4ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. And c is speed of light, ħ is reduced Planck constant, G is gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

So first, I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4π r^2, where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But wait, I don't have r directly. I have the angular size θ and distance d. Oh right, the angular size θ relates to the size of the event horizon as seen from a distance.

The formula for angular size is θ ≈ (diameter of the object) / distance. But wait, the event horizon has diameter 2r, so diameter is 2r. So θ (in radians) is approximately 2r / d. So r = (d θ) /
