Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq and some issues with the peaks disappearing when a different fixation method is used. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my epigenetics techniques, but let me think this through.

Alright, the setup: They did a ChIP-seq experiment on PFA-fixed human B cells using an antibody for IKAROS, a transcription factor. After standard processing, they got some peaks, but when they switched to PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks vanished. The question is asking where these disappearing peaks are most likely located.

Wait, what's the deal with PFA and DSG fixation? I remember that PFA, paraformaldehyde, is a common fixative. It crosslinks proteins and DNA, right? So it's used to preserve the structure of the cells and the interactions, like where the transcription factors are binding. But why would adding DSG make a difference?

Oh wait, DSG is dithiothreitol. I think it's a reducing agent. PFA might not fully crosslink everything, or maybe DSG helps modify the crosslinking. Alternatively, when you use PFA without DSG, the crosslinking might be more extensive, perhaps leading to more background noise or something. Or maybe the oppositeâ€”DSG might help in breaking disulfide bonds, making the proteins more accessible for the antibody?

Wait, another thought. I've heard that different fixation methods can affect the efficiency of crosslinking. PFA alone might not be optimal for certain epitopes because it's a small molecule and might not penetrate as well, especially in certain regions of the genome. Or maybe DSG enhances the crosslinking efficiency, leading to more complete preservation of the protein-DNA interactions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the accessibility of the antibody. If the crosslinking is too tight, the antibody can't access the epitope. But wait, in this case, when using PFA+DSG, the peaks disappear. So without DSG, they were seeing peaks which aren't present when DSG is added. That suggests that the initial method (PFA alone) allowed the antibody to bind, but with DSG, perhaps the epitope is somehow masked or the crosslinking is more thorough, leading to better specificity.

Wait, another angle: I think that DSG is sometimes used in combination with PFA to improve crosslinking. For instance, some protocols suggest adding DSG to facilitate more efficient crosslinking of proteins to DNA. So perhaps without DSG,
