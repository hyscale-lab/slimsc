Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, will switch the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

The given data:
- Mass of atom X (Mx) is 20 amu,
- Mass of atom Y (My) is 2 amu,
- Bond length R is 2 angstroms,
- Angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

The options are four different momenta in N*s.

Hmm, okay. So the molecule is in its fundamental state. I'm a bit confused about what that exactly means. In the context of quantum mechanics for molecules, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So, it's the ground state.

Wait, but the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh wait, perhaps it's the next higher energy state. But I'm not entirely sure if the next state is the first excited state or something else.

Wait, the model is the rotation-vibration model. So this probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. That makes sense because a diatomic molecule can both rotate and vibrate.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the rotational quantum number. But in the non-rigid rotor model, it's more like the bond can stretch a bit, so the moment of inertia isn't constant. But I'm not sure how that affects the energy transitions here.

But the question is about the photon's momentum. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between two states. So the photon's energy should be equal to the energy required to make the transition.

But wait, the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, I think that means the next higher energy state. Because the fundamental state is the ground state, so the next state is the first excited state.

Wait, but in molecules, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational. So the energy levels are actually a product of both. The fundamental vibrational state is when the vibrational quantum number is at its lowest, which is n=0.
