Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Wait, rhombohedral... I remember that's one of the crystal systems. Oh right, it's also called the trigonal crystal system sometimes. The unit cell has all sides equal and all angles equal too, right? So in this problem, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees.

I think the interplanar distance formula for a crystal is given by the Miller indices. Oh yeah, the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosα) + 2(hl cosβ) + 2(kl cosγ) )) ), but wait, is that correct? Or was it a different arrangement? Maybe it's d = (a² (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, but here the angles are 30 degrees so I can't use the cubic version.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is d_{hkl} = (a² (h² + k² + l²) + ...) but I'm not recalling it correctly. Maybe I should think about the structure factor or the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( [ (h² + k² + l²) - (h + k + l)(something) ] ), but I'm not sure.

Oh wait, I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system goes like this: d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(alpha) ) ), but wait, because all the angles are the same, 30 degrees. So in this case, alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees. So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), where θ is 30 degrees.

Wait, that seems more accurate. Because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal
