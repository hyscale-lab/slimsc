Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and calculating the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the structure of the crystal lattice. Let me think about what I know regarding crystals and interplanar distances.

First, rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Wait, but wait, I think rhombohedral systems can have different types, like if the angles are all 90 degrees, it's a cubic system. But when they're not, it's a rhombohedral. So yeah, this is a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c and angles 30 degrees each.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. I'm assuming that means the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms. Because in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, the atoms are at the vertices, so the same applies? I think so.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes in the crystal. The formula I remember for interplanar distance d is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + (2hk cosγ) + ... wait no, maybe that's not right. Wait, in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but for non-cubic systems, especially rhombohedral, the formula is a bit more complicated.

I think the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hk) cosθ + ... )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal uses the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices h, k, l. For a rhombohedral system, which is a special case of a hexagonal system? Or is it a cubic system with non-right angles? Wait no,
