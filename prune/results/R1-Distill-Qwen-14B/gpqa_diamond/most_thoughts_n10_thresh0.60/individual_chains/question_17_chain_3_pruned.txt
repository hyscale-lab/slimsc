Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The problem states that the concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Wait, stoichiometric means that the ratio is 1:1, right? So each formula unit of the complex has one Ca²+ ion and one EDTA^4- ion. 

The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so I don't need to worry about that affecting the K value. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. Oh, right, that's the formation constant, Kf. Formation constant tells us how much the complex forms from its ions.

So, I think I should write the formation reaction. The complex is Ca-EDTA, so the reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-

Wait, wait. No, wait, the complex is usually written as CaY²− where Y is the EDTA. So the reaction is Ca²+ + Y^4− → CaY²−. The formation constant Kf is [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][Y^4−]).

In this problem, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. Since the reaction forms 1 mole of complex from 1 mole of Ca²+ and 1 mole of EDTA^4-, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be zero if they weren't present, but wait, no—when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Wait, but wait. The solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex. So the only thing present is the complex. So, the solution is 0.02 M in CaY²−. So, the complex will dissociate a little into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−.

But given that the K is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable
