Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration given is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds metal ions like calcium pretty tightly. So when Ca reacts with EDTA, they form a complex. The formation constant (Kf) tells us how stable that complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable, so the reaction goes more to the product side.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, but in solution, the complex will dissociate a little bit. So, the concentration of free Ca²+ ions will be what we're looking for, right?

The reaction for the complex formation is probably something like:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
And the formation constant Kf is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, before any dissociation, the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. But in reality, some of this complex will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. 

However, since Kf is very large (5x10^10), the dissociation should be minimal. That implies that the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very low. So, the solution is mostly the complex with a little bit of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

I need to find [Ca²+] in this solution. Let's denote the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Since each mole of CaEDTA^2- that dissociates produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. 

So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. After dissociation, the concentration becomes (0.02 - x). But because Kf is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That should simplify the calculations.

The expression for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Substituting the approximated concentrations:
(0.02) / (x * x) ) = 5e10.

So, 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange this equation.

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Compute the right side: 0.02 is 2e-2. So (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root of 4e-13 gives x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, sqrt(4) is 2. And sqrt(1e-12) is 1e-6. So 2e-6.5? Wait, no, wait. 4e-13 = 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5, which is 3.16e-7 approximately. Wait, let me calculate that properly.

Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Because (1e-6.5)^2 = (3.16e-
