Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas given are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one of these formulas.

First, I'll break down each of the spectroscopic data points.

Starting with the FTIR: The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad around that region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad peak too, but maybe not as broad as a carboxylic acid. Also, the presence of two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, those are in the higher range. 1700 is often a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation.

Wait, 1700 is typical for a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching), or perhaps another carbonyl group, but at a lower wavenumber. Wait, if the compound has two carbonyl groups? That's possible. Or maybe 1650 is something else, like an amide or maybe conjugated double bonds.

Looking at the NMR next. The 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so that suggests the compound has some sort of double bond, probably an alkene. So maybe the compound is something like an ester with a double bond, or maybe a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Mass spectrometry: The fragment peak is at m/z=45. I need to think about what fragments could give that. 45 is a common mass for a fragment like (CH3)2CO (acetone, which is
