Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one fits all the given data.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The problem says there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the other two strong peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, 1650 is a bit lower. Could it be an aromatic ring, maybe a conjugated carbonyl or something else?

Wait, maybe I should think about possible functional groups. A broad peak at 3000 could be an alcohol's O-H stretch. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, that would be a broad peak too, but that might also show a peak at around 2500-3300 for the O-H. But the problem says the broad peak is at 3000, so maybe it's an alcohol or a phenolic O-H. Or maybe an amine? No, amine N-H stretches are usually around 3300-3500, right? So probably O-H.

Then the 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong C=O. So maybe the compound has both an alcohol group and a carbonyl group. Wait, but another peak at 1650. Could that be an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl? Like maybe an aromatic ketone? Or perhaps an ester or another carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, another thought: 1700 is a typical ester or ketone or aldehyde. But 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl like in an aromatic ester or maybe a conjugated ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a double bond (C=C) since that's around 1650. But then, the NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So the compound has a double bond, perhaps in a conjugated system with a carbonyl.

So combining
