Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, right, so Lithium typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, I think. So, the atomic number is 3, and the mass number is 6.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. So, energy in particle physics usually refers to the kinetic energy. But sometimes it could be the total energy, including rest mass. I need to be careful here. The problem says the energy of the RHIC. I remember that in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy per particle, but sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, but wait, the options are in GeV, which is a unit of energy. So maybe it's the total energy, including rest mass energy.

The formula I think I need here involves the relativistic energy of a particle. The total energy E is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy (m c squared), right?

So E = gamma * m c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma.

Let me compute gamma first. So v = 0.96c. Then v²/c² = (0.96)^2. Let me calculate 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So yes, gamma is about 3.5714.

But I should be precise here. Let me compute 1/(sqrt(0.0784)) accurately. sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the mass of the nucleus X, which is Li-6. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But wait, for heavy ions in colliders, they often use the rest mass energy in GeV. So, the rest mass of a Li-
