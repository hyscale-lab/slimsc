Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, in this case, the elements are carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). 

The problem gives me some bond energies. Let's jot those down. The enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. That probably means the energy required to break a carbon into atoms, right? So each C atom would require 1000 kJ/mol to form from solid carbon, maybe like graphite or something.

Then the bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Wait, I think bond energies are the energy required to break a bond. So when bonds form, it releases energy, and when they break, it absorbs.

The formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants) ] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]

But wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Because when bonds break in reactants, you're putting energy in, and when bonds form in products, you're getting energy out. So the enthalpy change is products minus reactants. Or, more accurately, the enthalpy of the products minus the enthalpy of the reactants.

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is calculated by taking the sum of the energies of the bonds broken in the reactants and subtracting the sum of the energies of the bonds formed in the products. Or is it the bonds formed minus bonds broken? Hmm, maybe I should recall the formula correctly.

Oh right, the standard formula is:

ΔH°f = [Σ (Bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (Bond energies of products)]

Wait, no. No, wait. Actually, I think I got it backwards. When bonds are broken, you're putting energy in—so you add the bond energies of the
