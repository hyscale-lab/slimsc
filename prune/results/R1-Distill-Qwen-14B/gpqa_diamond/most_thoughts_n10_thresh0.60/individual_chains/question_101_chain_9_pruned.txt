Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me see what the question is about. 

The question says a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out which reagent (A) and catalyst (B) were used.

First, I'll try to visualize the reactants and the product. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring with a methyl group at position 3. The product, 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine, looks like it's a bicyclic structure. Wait, no, maybe it's a ring expansion? Because cyclohexylidenemethyl suggests a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group. 

So the reaction is between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A in the presence of a catalyst, probably an acid. The options give possible A's as cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane, and the catalysts are TsOH or acetic acid.

I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions often involve things like aldehyde groups or alkenes. Since 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine, perhaps the reaction is an alkylation or some kind of addition.

Wait, another thought: Maybe this is a type of ring expansion. I've heard of reactions where a secondary amine reacts with an aldehyde to form a larger ring. Oh, right! The Paal-Knorr synthesis of pyrroles uses a similar concept, but that's for forming five-membered rings. Alternatively, there's the possibility of a Mannich reaction, but that usually involves amines, ketones, and aldehydes.

Wait, wait. Another reaction is the formation of a bicyclic compound through a conjugate addition or some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but pyrrolidines aren't aromatic, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction involves the formation of an imine or a Schiff base. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the product structure again. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the cyclohexylidene group is attached via a methylene to the pyrrolidine. 

Hmm, that seems like a cyclohexene ring attached to the pyrrolidine via a CH2 group. So perhaps a ring-forming reaction occurred. 

Wait, thinking about the possible reagents. Let's look at the options. The reagents A are either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. So cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is (cyclohexyl)formaldehyde, right? So it's an aldehyde group attached to a cyclohexane. Vinylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually it's CH2CH2 as part of
