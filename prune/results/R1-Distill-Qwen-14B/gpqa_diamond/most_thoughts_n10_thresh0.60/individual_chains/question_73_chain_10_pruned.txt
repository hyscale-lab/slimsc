Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light, I need to use special relativity principles. Let me try to break this down.

The problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, there's the velocity addition formula. The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/cÂ²). Let me make sure I get that right.

So astronaut A has mass 2m and speed u = 0.6c. Astronaut B has mass 3m and speed v = 0.5c. Wait, wait, no, actually, I should clarify: the question is about the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So if I want the speed of B as seen from A's frame, or vice versa? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem says "relative speed". Oh, it's the speed of one relative to the other. But in relativity, the order matters because the formula isn't symmetric. Let's think: if A is moving at 0.6c and B is moving at
