Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, with some very small numbers in meters. I remember that decay lengths are usually measured in units like femtometers (1e-15 m), so these options are in that ballpark.

First, I think about what determines the mean decay distance. I recall that particles that decay quickly have a short mean lifetime, which relates to their width. But wait, the decay distance would depend on the lifetime (mean lifetime) and the particle's velocity. The formula, I think, is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (c being the speed of light) and then multiplied by the velocity of the particle. Or wait, maybe it's the velocity multiplied by c times the lifetime? Let me think.

The mean decay length L is given by L = v * c * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime. The velocity v is related to the particle's energy and mass. Since mesons are bosons, but the specifics probably don't matter here. The decay width Γ is connected to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have that backward. The uncertainty principle says ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a particle, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, so Γ ≈ ΔE. And the lifetime τ is the uncertainty in time, so Γ τ ≈ ħ, making τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). So yes, τ is ħ divided by Γ.

Now, putting it all together. The decay distance L is v * c * (ħ / Γ). But wait, what's v? The velocity of the particle. Since E is given as 8 GeV, which is the production energy, I think that's the total energy of the meson X. So the total energy E is γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But m is given in GeV/c², so perhaps it's better to work in natural units where c=1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the velocity of the meson. The energy E is 8 GeV, and the mass m is 1.2 GeV/c². So the kinetic energy is E - m c², but since we're using E as the total energy, E = γ m c². So, γ = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8/1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then the velocity v is given by v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let's compute that. Wait, gamma is 6.6667. So 1/γ is about 0.15. 1/(gamma squared) is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is approximately sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887, which is a significant fraction of c. Alternatively, maybe I should express it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2) ) / c. Then
