Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance. The given data includes production energy, mass, and width. Hmm, I remember that the decay length has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let's try to recall.

Wait, the mean decay distance (or decay length) is calculated using the formula L = gamma * beta * c * tau. Tau is the particle's lifetime, right? But wait, I think tau is related to the width Gamma through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh right, the uncertainty principle says that the lifetime tau is approximately hbar divided by Gamma. So tau ≈ ħ / Gamma.

But wait, wait. Gamma is given in MeV, and I need to convert units properly. Also, I remember that the width is related to the lifetime by Gamma = ħ / tau, but because Gamma is an energy, it's a bit tricky. Let's think in terms of natural units for a moment. In natural units, ħ = c = 1, so the lifetime is Gamma^{-1}. But since we're working in SI units, I'll have to calculate it with proper unit conversions.

So the steps I need to take are: 

1. Find the lifetime tau using Gamma.
2. Find the velocity beta of the particle.
3. Calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor.
4. Multiply gamma, beta, the speed of light, and tau to get the decay length.

First, let's compute tau. Gamma is given as 320 MeV. But I need to convert that into energy units compatible with ħ. I know that ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, the width is in MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma is 0.32 GeV. 

Tau = ħ / Gamma. So tau = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So tau ≈ 2.05687
