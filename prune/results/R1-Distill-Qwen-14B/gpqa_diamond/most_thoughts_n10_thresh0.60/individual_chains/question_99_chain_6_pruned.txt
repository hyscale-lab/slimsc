Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify an unknown compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the FTIR data shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in IR around that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since it's broad, I'm leaning towards a carboxylic acid because they have strong, broad O-H stretches. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits.

Now looking at the NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or if it does, the protons aren't showing up. But looking at the options, I don't see any with double bonds, so I can ignore that point.

The NMR has various splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complicated. I think I need to figure out the structure that would give such splitting.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
That's 4-methylpentanoic acid or something similar. Wait, the structure is (CH2CH2CH3) groups attached to a central carbon, then a CH2, then COOH. So the central carbon is connected to two C2H5 groups, a CH3, and a CH2COOH. So, the central H would be connected to four different groups, which would be a CH with two ethyl, one methyl, and one CH2COOH. Hmm, but wait, let me think about the structure.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
This structure has two ethyl groups, one methyl, and the COOH is directly attached. So the central carbons might be a geminal arrangement, but wait, maybe it's a di-substituted structure. Wait, no, the formula is CH2CH2-C-(C2H5) - C-(C2H5)-COOH. So the central part is two CH groups, each attached to an ethyl group and a COOH perhaps? Or maybe it's a structure with two substituents on adjacent carbons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
This looks like a gem-dimethyl structure on the central carbons. Wait, the structure would be CH3-C(CH3)(CH3)-CH2COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So each of the central carbons
