Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question is about finding the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

The problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that's the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. So we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50. Wait no, actually, the next 150 minutes from when? Oh, the question says 50 minutes have already passed, so the next 150 would make the total time 200 minutes? Or is it the next 150 minutes after the 50, so starting from 50 to 200? Or is the 150 minutes the remaining time? I think it's the next 150 minutes, meaning the next 150 after the 50 have passed, so the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

But wait, the initial 100 minutes is given for the decay probability of 32%. So perhaps the decay follows an exponential law. Let me think about that. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but here we're given a probability over 100 minutes.

The decay probability P(t) within time t is 1 - e^(-λ t). So for t = 100 minutes, P(100) = 0.32. So 1 - e^(-λ *100) = 0.32. That simplifies to e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Let me calculate this. ln(0.68) is approximately... Wait, ln(1)=0, ln(e^-0.4) is about -0.4, but wait, e^-0.4 is around 0.67, which is close to 0.68. So ln(0.68) is about -0.4. Let me get precise. Hmm, ln(0.68) is ln(1 - 0.32) which is approximately -0.4005. So λ ≈ 0.004005 per minute.

So λ is approximately 0.004005 per minute.

Now, the question is, given that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes? So the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

But wait, conditional probability. Since each moment has a certain chance, the fact that it didn't decay in the first 50 minutes affects the probability. Because radioactive decay has no memory; the
