Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

There's a spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor.

Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and the distance from P to the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each gives a different expression for E. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields and charges. 

Wait, I think when a conductor is uncharged, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the charges redistribute in a specific way. Oh right! In a conductor, the charges will arrange themselves such that the interior's electric field is zero. But wait, this is for a cavity that's completely enclosed. But in this case, the conductor is uncharged, so initially, there were no free charges. But then we add +q inside the cavity. 

I remember that when a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface will have +q, since the conductor was initially neutral. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If you have a conductor and you place a charge inside a cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of opposite sign to the placed charge. So here, since the cavity is inside the conductor, the inner surface of the conductor (which is the outer surface of the cavity) will have -q. But the conductor was uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor must be zero. So the outer surface must have a charge of +q because the inner is -q, so they cancel each other out? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. So the total charge on the conductor is zero. So when you place +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. Then, since the
