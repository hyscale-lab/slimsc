Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit a nervous because electromagnetism can be tricky. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a spherical conductor with a cavity. The setup is that there's a big sphere with radius R, and inside it, there's a smaller cavity with radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the big sphere, and s must be less than R because r < R. So the cavity isn't exactly at the center.

Now, someone places a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. We need to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the big sphere. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l is greater than R. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, the options are all expressions involving these variables, so I need to figure out which one correctly represents the electric field at point P.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. Okay, so the big sphere is a conductor. Conductors have charges on the surface, right? But wait, in this case, the conductor itself is uncharged. So initially, it has no charge. But there's a charge inside the cavity. How does that affect things?

I think when you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Oh right! The charge +q in the cavity induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor because the conductor is neutral. Then, the outer surface of the conductor must also have some charge. Wait, no, because the conductor is neutral overall. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q to balance it, making the total charge of the conductor zero. But wait, no, the conductor itself is neutral. So any induced charges must balance out. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me think again. The conductor is uncharged, so the total induced charge on the inner and outer surfaces must sum to zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. Because the charge +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced charge of -
