Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for three different reactions and match them with the options provided.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael addition is a 1,4-addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually enolate, and it attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. The product is a new carbon-carbon bond, and the alpha position becomes the site of a ketone or similar group.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each a Michael addition reaction. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate are the reactants, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It's a dienolate, actually. Because malonate has two acidic alpha hydrogens. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it deprotonates to form an enolate. But since it's dimethyl, maybe the enolate is more stabilized. 

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. So, the acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. The enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate.

So when the enolate attacks, the alpha position of the acrylate (the carbonyl) becomes a ketone or, in this case, perhaps another ester. Wait, the acrylate is an ester, so after the addition, the structure would have the malonate part attached to the acrylate.

Let me visualize this. The acrylate is E-configured, so the p-tolyl group is on one end, the ester on the other. The enolate from malonate (which is a strong nucleophile) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the attack would happen at the carbon next to the carbonyl. 

The product would then have the malonate's part connected to the acrylate's beta carbon. So the structure would have a new carbon-carbon bond between the two. 

So, the product A would be a tricarboxylate. Because dimethyl malonate has two methyl groups and two carboxylate groups. When it adds to the acrylate, the structure would be something like O=C-OCH3 attached to the new carbon from the attack.

Wait, the initial structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-p-tolyl-CO-OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Oh, wait, the formula given is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)ac
