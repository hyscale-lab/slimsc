Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about the decay of a boson X. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Hmm, wait, I think I should parse that correctly. Oh right, I remember that the general form for a Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ ψ X, where X is the boson. So in this case, the term must be something like λ times the fermion fields and the boson X. But the given expression is a bit confusing with the notation. Let me think. The term looks like -λ f times ψ_f bar times (v + X) times ψ_f. Oh, wait, maybe v is the vacuum expectation value? Or perhaps it's a typo and the fermion field is written as ψ_f. Maybe the term is actually -λ f ψ_f bar X ψ_f, and v is some constant, like the VEV. But in any case, the interaction is between X and fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, the possible decay products of X must be pairs of fermions. For a decay to be allowed, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair because of energy and momentum conservation. So I need to find which fermion pairs can be produced with the X boson's mass of 6 GeV.

Let me list out possible fermion pairs. Fermions include quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos).

But wait, the interaction term in the Lagrangian will determine which fermions X can couple to. Because the interaction is given as L = -λ f ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f, I think this implies that X couples directly to fermions. So any fermion that can interact via this term can be a decay product.

Wait, but the term is written as ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm. Maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me think again. The term is probably something like ψ_f X ψ_f, meaning X interacts with the fermion ψ_f. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that it couples to. But which fermions are these?

Wait, looking at the interaction Lagrangian again, it's written as -λ f ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the f is a charge here? Or is it a typo? Oh wait, the term is written as -λ f ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. Maybe f is the fermion type, like up, down, etc. So, the interaction is with all the fermions
