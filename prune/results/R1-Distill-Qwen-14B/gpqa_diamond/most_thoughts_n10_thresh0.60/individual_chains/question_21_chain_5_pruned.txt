Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Let me tackle them one by one.

Part A: We need to determine which compound does not show tautomerism among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and another atom (like oxygen or nitrogen) between two adjacent atoms, resulting in a different structure but the same molecular formula. This usually happens in compounds with conjugated double bonds, especially those with keto and enol forms. So, like in ketones or aldehydes, or maybe in some cyclic structures.

Benzoquinone—I think that's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone refers to a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms each double-bonded to a carbon. So, it's something like O=C6H4=O, but wait, actually, benzoquinone can have different structures. Wait, benzoquinone could be 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. But regardless, it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, it's a tricyclic ketone, right?

Now, tautomerism—so can these compounds undergo tautomerism?

Benzoquinone: I'm trying to remember. Benzoquinone is a conjugated system because the two ketone groups are in conjugation. So, perhaps it can undergo some tautomerism. Wait, but wait—if a compound has two carbonyl groups, maybe they can tautomerize. For example, 1,4-benzoquinone can tautomerize to something else, like a cyclohexadienedione or something. Or maybe it's about keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: three ketones in the ring. Since all the carbonyl groups
