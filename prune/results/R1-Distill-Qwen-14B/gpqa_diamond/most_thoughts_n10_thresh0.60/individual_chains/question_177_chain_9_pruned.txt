Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, so I think mass might not directly affect it, but maybe luminosity is linked to something else like temperature?

The problem says that the astronomers found the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest to be the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body is determined by its temperature. Wien's Law, I think. Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait, so if both stars have the same temperature, then their luminosity would depend on their radius. Because the luminosity of a star (as a black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh right, so luminosity depends on the square of the radius and the fourth power of the temperature.

So if L1 is the luminosity of Star_1 and L2 that of Star_2:

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

But since T1 = T2, T1⁴ cancels out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is ~2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I miss anything else in the problem? The problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm. Radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But if the star is moving, that affects observed quantities like Doppler shift, right?

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So when they did spectroscopy, they found the same peak wavelength. But if the stars are moving, their spectral lines would be Doppler shifted. Oh wait, but the peak wavelength is determined by the star's temperature, because Wien's law is about the star's emission. So if a star is moving towards us, its emitted light would be blueshifted, making it appear hotter (smaller wavelength), and if moving away, redshifted, appearing cooler (larger wavelength). But according to the problem, the peak wavelengths are the same. So that implies that any
