Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The question is about their luminosities. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. The key factors affecting luminosity are the star's radius and temperature. Oh wait, the formula for luminosity as a black body is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? So L depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

Looking at the problem: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, mass probably relates to temperature somehow, but wait, how? I'm not sure. Maybe through some other property or perhaps using the mass-luminosity relation?

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest are the same. So their peak emission wavelengths are the same, so their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. Got it.

So, going back to the luminosity formula. L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities will be (R1 / R2)². Because T is same, T⁴ cancels out. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squared, that's 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. So the factor is ~2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but hold on. The problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of zero, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does that come into play? Hmm. Oh wait, maybe it's a Doppler shift thing. Because the observed wavelength might shift due to the star's velocity. So if the star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength changes.

Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the maximum emission wavelengths are the same as observed. But if Star_2 is moving, its emitted wavelength would be Doppler shifted. So the actual emitted wavelength is different, but after shifting, they appear the same.

So, let me think. The peak wavelength emitted by Star_2 is λ2, and after redshift or blueshift, it's λ_obs2. Similarly, Star_1's
