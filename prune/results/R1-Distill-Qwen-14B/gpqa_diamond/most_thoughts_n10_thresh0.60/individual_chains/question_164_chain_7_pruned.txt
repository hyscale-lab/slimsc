Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star stuff, but let's try to think it through.

The question says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing binaries, meaning the stars pass in front of each other from our point of view. The periods between primary eclipses are 2 years and 1 year respectively. Wait, the period of an eclipsing binary is the orbital period, right? So the time it takes for the stars to orbit each other once.

Then, the radial velocity (RV) observations show sinusoidal variations. The amplitudes are given for each system. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. For system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. The question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of both stars in the system.

I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method helps determine the masses. The mass function relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses. Oh right, the mass function for each star in the binary is (M^3 sin^3 i)/( (M + M')^2 ), but I think for this problem, we can make some simplifications, maybe assuming edge-on orbits (so sin i is 1) because eclipsing binaries are usually edge-on.

Wait, but maybe I should recall the formula for the mass function and how it relates to the velocities. The mass function f(M) = (v1^3 P) / (2Ï€ G), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the velocity semi-amplitude and how it relates to the masses.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star moves slower, and the less massive moves faster. So the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of their masses. So v1 / v2 = M2 / M1.

Wait, yeah, because M1 v1 = M2 v2. So M1 = (v2 / v1) * M2. So the mass ratio q = M2 / M1 = v1 / v2.

Wait, let's think again. The center of mass is at a point where M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a
