Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so the nucleus in question must be moving at a speed close to the speed of light. 

Wait, the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. That makes sense. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

I think I need to find the total energy of this ion when it's moving at 0.96c. Oh right, in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, we use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, I think. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), right?

So first, I should calculate gamma for v = 0.96c. Let me compute that. Let's see, v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Wait, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 divided by that is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216, so 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root is 0.28, yes. 1/0.28 is 3.57142857... So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for a Li-6 nucleus with 6 nucleons, the rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that: 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m_rest_c². Substituting the numbers: E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3.5714 times 5.628. Hmm, let's break it down. 3.5 * 5.6 is about 19.6, but I need to be more precise.

3.5714 * 5.628:

First, 3 *5.628 is 16.884.

0.5714 *5.628. Let's compute 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814. 0.0714 *5.628 is approximately 0.4033. So adding those together: 2.814 +0.4033=3.2173.

So 16.884 +3.2173=20.1013 GeV.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator method. Let me do it step by step.

3.5714 * 5.628:

Let me write it as (3 + 0.5 + 0.0714) *5.628.

So 3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.5 *5.628 =2.814.

0.0714 *5.628 ≈ 0.4033.

Adding those: 16.884 +2.814 is 19.698. 19.698 +0.4033 is 20.1013.

So approximately 20.1013 GeV. Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have missed some precision in the gamma calculation. Let me redo gamma more accurately.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 ). Let me compute 0.96^2 exactly. 0.96 *0.96 = (1 - 0.04)^2 = 1 - 0.08 + 0.0016 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28 *0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is exactly 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857...

So more accurately, gamma is 3.57142857...

Then, 3.57142857 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

Let me break it down:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.142857142

3.57142857 *0.028 = let's see: 3.57142857 *0.02 = 0.0714285714; 3.57142857 *0.008 = 0.02857142856. Adding those: 0.0714285714 +0.02857142856 = 0.10000000 (approx 0.1 exactly, since 0.0714285714 is 1/14, and 0.0285714286 is 2/70, which is 1/35; 1/14 +1/35 = (5 + 2)/70 = 7/70=1/10=0.1). So 3.57142857 *0.028 =0.1.

Adding them all up: 17.85714285 (from 5) + 2.142857142 (from 0.6) is 20. So 17.85714285 +2.142857142 = 20. Then adding 0.1 from the 0.028 part, total is 20.1.

Hmm, so 20.1 GeV. But wait, looking back at the options, the closest is option C: 20.132 GeV. So why is the calculation giving 20.1? Did I make a mistake in the gamma calculation? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more precisely. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.628:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.628 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.628 as: 5.628 *3.57142857.

Wait, 5.628 *3 =16.884, 5.628*0.5=2.814, 5.628 *0.07142857.

Wait, maybe approach it differently. Let me compute 5.628 *3.57142857.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact fractions. I know that 3.57142857 is exactly 25/7. Because 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857. Let me check: 25 divided by 7 is 3.57142857... yes.

So 25/7 *5.628 GeV.

5.628 is 5628/1000 = 1407/250. Because 5628 ÷4=1407, 1000 ÷4=250. So 1407/250.

So 25/7 *1407/250 = (25*1407)/(7*250)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

25 and 250: 25/250 =1/10.

So numerator: 25*1407= 35175.

Denominator: 7 *250=1750.

So 35175 /1750 = let's compute that.

35175 ÷1750.

Well, 1750 *20 =35000. So 35175 -35000=175.

So 20 +175/1750 = 20 + 0.1 = 20.1.

Ah, so 25/7 *5.628 =20.1.

So the energy is 20.1 GeV. But wait, the options don't have exactly 20.1. Option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check. Li-6 has 6 nucleons: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each nucleon's rest energy is about 938 MeV. So 6*938 =5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait a second. The rest mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6 times the rest mass of a proton (or neutron). Because when you combine nucleons, there's a mass deficit due to binding energy. But in high-energy physics, when calculating the energy for collisions, they often use the sum of the individual rest masses, assuming that the binding energy is negligible compared to the kinetic energy at such high speeds. So perhaps for this problem, we are supposed to use 5.628 GeV as the rest mass energy.

So according to that, the total energy is 20.1 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So why the discrepancy? Did I make a mistake in the calculation of gamma?

Wait, let me recalculate gamma precisely. Gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Compute (0.96)^2 exactly: 0.96 *0.96 =0.9216. So 1 -0.9216 =0.0784. Now, sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 =3.57142857..., which is correct.

So 3.57142857 *5.628 is indeed 20.1. So the answer should be 20.1 GeV. But option C is 20.132, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the rest mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6*(mass of a proton), but maybe a little less due to binding energy. But in high-energy physics, when you're dealing with relativistic speeds, the binding energy is often considered negligible compared to the rest mass. But perhaps in this problem, the precise calculation is required.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the rest mass of the Li nucleus is given as a certain value. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact mass of Li-6. Let me recall the exact value. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.015 *931.5 MeV is the rest mass energy.

Wait, that's a more accurate approach. Because using 6 *938 MeV ignores the binding energy. So perhaps the correct rest mass is a bit less than 6 *938 MeV.

Let me compute that. Li-6 has a mass of about 6.015 u. So mass energy is 6.015 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.015 *931.5 =13.9725 MeV.

So total is 5589 +13.9725=5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

Wait, that's a bit less than 5.628 GeV I used earlier. Oh, so that's a difference. So perhaps I should use 5.603 GeV as the rest mass.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=gamma * m_rest =3.57142857 *5.6029725 GeV.

Let me compute that.

First, 3 *5.603 ≈16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603 ≈?

0.5 *5.603 =2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603 ≈ 0.403 (since 0.07 *5.603 is ~0.3922, plus 0.00142857 *5.603≈0.007999, so total ~0.3922 +0.007999=0.4002.

So 2.8015 +0.4002=3.2017.

Adding that to 16.809:

16.809 +3.2017=20.0107 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 20.01 GeV, which is even lower than before. So now we're getting 20.01 GeV, which is closer to 20 GeV, but none of the options exactly match. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Wait, but none of these are exactly 20.1 or 20.01. Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the mass of a single proton and neutron, but maybe the nucleus is treated as a single particle with mass A times the mass of a proton. Alternatively, maybe the mass is being approximated as 6 times the proton mass, but without considering binding energy, leading to 5.628 GeV, which when multiplied by gamma gives 20.1 GeV. But the options don't have exactly that.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done with more precise numbers. Let me recompute gamma more accurately.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So, E = gamma * m_rest =3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Let me compute this exactly:

5.628 *3.57142857.

5.628 *3 =16.884.

5.628 *0.5 =2.814.

5.628 *0.07142857 ≈ let's compute 5.628 *0.07 =0.394, 5.628 *0.00142857≈0.008032. So total approximately 0.394+0.008032=0.402032.

Adding them: 16.884 +2.814=19.698, +0.402032=20.100032 GeV.

So that's approximately 20.1000 GeV, which rounds to 20.100 GeV. But the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong rest mass. Let me look up the exact rest mass of Li-6. Hmm, I think the exact value is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). So converting that to GeV.

1 u = 931.5 MeV =0.9315 GeV.

So 6.015 u *0.9315 GeV/u = ?

6 *0.9315 =5.589 GeV.

0.015 *0.9315 =0.0139725 GeV.

So total is 5.589 +0.0139725=5.6029725 GeV.

So the rest mass is approximately 5.603 GeV.

So E=gamma * m_rest=3.57142857 *5.603 ≈ let's compute:

3 *5.603 =16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603.

0.5 *5.603 =2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603 ≈0.4017.

So 2.8015+0.4017=3.2032.

Total E=16.809 +3.2032=20.0122 GeV.

So approximately 20.012 GeV. Which is about 20.01 GeV.

But the options don't have this exact number. The closest is option C)20.132, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise calculations for the rest mass. Let me try using 5.6029725 GeV as the rest mass.

So 3.57142857 *5.6029725.

Breaking it down:

5.6029725 *3 =16.8089175.

5.6029725 *0.5 =2.80148625.

5.6029725 *0.07142857.

Hmm, 0.07142857 is 1/14, approximately.

So 5.6029725 /14 = approx 0.40021232 GeV.

Adding the parts: 16.8089175 +2.80148625 =19.61040375. Then +0.40021232 =20.010616 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.0106 GeV.

So approximately 20.0106 GeV. Which is about 20.01 GeV.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, but that's 0.12 higher. So why the difference? Did I make a mistake in the rest mass calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each nucleon as 938 MeV, including the binding energy. So 6 *938 =5628 MeV =5.628 GeV. So using that, the energy is 3.57142857 *5.628 =20.1000 GeV.

So that's 20.100 GeV, which is 20.100 GeV. But the options C is 20.132, which is about 0.032 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is needed to more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial speed is given as 0.96c, which is 0.96 exactly. Maybe the calculation of gamma is done more accurately.

Let me compute gamma again precisely.

v =0.96c.

v² = (0.96)^2 c² =0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² =0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

gamma =1/0.28 =3.5714285714.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should take the exact value of 5.628 GeV and multiply by 3.5714285714.

5.628 *3.5714285714.

Breaking it down: 5 *3.5714285714 =17.857142857.

0.628 *3.5714285714.

0.6 *3.5714285714 =2.1428571428.

0.028 *3.5714285714 =0.100.

So 2.1428571428 +0.100 =2.2428571428.

Adding to 17.857142857:

17.857142857 +2.242857143 =20.100 GeV.

So exactly 20.100 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.032 GeV higher. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be. Or perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the original question. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6, so mass is 6 nucleons. So the rest mass energy is 6 *938 MeV =5.628 GeV. So with that, gamma is 3.5714, so E=20.100 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.1, but option C is 20.132, which is 0.032 GeV higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the speed was taken as 0.96c, but perhaps the gamma calculation is done with more precise decimal places.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately. Wait, 0.0784 is (0.28)^2. So sqrt is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857...

So 3.57142857 *5.628 =20.100 GeV.

So perhaps the problem expects rounding to three decimal places, making it 20.100 GeV, which would be option C if it were 20.100. But option C is 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise gamma and rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the exact value of gamma without approximating the square root.

Wait, perhaps the sqrt(0.0784) is not exactly 0.28. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. So sqrt is exactly 0.28. So no error there.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Based on the calculations, the energy should be approximately 20.10 GeV, which isn't exactly any of the given options. The closest is option C)20.132. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me double-check the rest mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.01507 atomic mass units (u). So let me compute 6.01507 u into GeV.

6.01507 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6.01507 *931.5 = let's compute.

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.01507 *931.5 ≈0.01507 *900=13.563, 0.01507 *31.5=0.474855. So total ≈13.563 +0.474855=14.037855 MeV.

So total is 5589 +14.037855=5603.037855 MeV=5.603037855 GeV.

So m_rest=5.603037855 GeV.

E = gamma * m_rest =3.57142857 *5.603037855.

Let me compute that:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603037855.

Hmm, perhaps compute 3.57142857 *0.603037855.

0.6 *3.57142857=2.142857142.

0.003037855 *3.57142857≈0.010857.

So 2.142857142 +0.010857≈2.153714.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153714≈20.010856 GeV.

So approximately 20.010856 GeV, which is 20.011 GeV when rounded to four decimal places.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem uses the sum of individual protons and neutrons without considering binding energy, leading to 5.628 GeV, which gives E=20.100 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132, which is 0.032 higher. Maybe there's a calculation mistake in the options, or perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is considered as 6.015 u, which is 5.603 GeV, and then E=gamma*m_rest=3.5714 *5.603=20.012 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise gamma. Let me compute gamma using more precise v.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.5714285714.

But perhaps the problem uses a more precise calculation, like using v=0.96c which is 288/300 c? No, that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma is computed as 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)) = 1/(sqrt(0.0784))= 3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps I should compute E as 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV.

3.57142857 *5.603.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603 =16.809.

0.57142857 *5.603.

Compute 0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.07142857 *5.603 ≈0.4002.

So 2.8015 +0.4002=3.2017.

Adding to 16.809: 16.809 +3.2017=20.0107 GeV.

So about 20.0107 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the nucleon masses, leading to 5.628 GeV, which when multiplied by gamma gives 20.1 GeV. But the closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation was done with more precise values, leading to a slight increase.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.603 with more precision.

Let me compute 5.603 *3.57142857.

3.57142857 can be written as 25/7.

So 5.603 *25/7 = (5.603 *25)/7.

5.603 *25 =140.075.

140.075 /7 =20.0107142857 GeV.

So 20.01071 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0107 GeV.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't in the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using a different rest mass, perhaps using the exact value including binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider relativistic energy with the exact mass.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the nucleus is moving at 0.96c, and the energy is (gamma -1) multiplied by the rest mass energy plus the kinetic energy, but no, the question asks for the total energy, which is gamma * m c².

Hmm.

Well, given the options, the closest to my calculation is C)20.132 GeV, but my calculation with the exact rest mass gives about 20.01 GeV. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to 20.1 GeV, which is 20.100, but the option C is 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this more precisely.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise decimal places, but 0.28 is exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the rest mass to be considered as 6 *938 MeV, giving 5.628 GeV, leading to E=20.100 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma again.

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857 exactly.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV=20.100 GeV.

So the answer should be 20.100 GeV. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is 20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is calculated as the sum of protons and neutrons without considering binding energy. So 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. Each is 938 MeV, so 5.628 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.628=20.100 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the gamma is calculated using more precise decimal places, but I think I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, but in terms of beta, beta=0.96, and gamma is calculated as 1/sqrt(1-beta^2). Let me compute that again.

beta=0.96.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) =1/sqrt(1-0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=3.57142857.

So same as before.

Hmm. I think the closest answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not entirely sure why. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.603 GeV precisely.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.603.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.603.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.142857142.

3.57142857 *0.003=0.01071428571.

Adding those: 2.142857142 +0.01071428571=2.153571428.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.153571428=20.010714278 GeV.

So 20.0107 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.01 GeV.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the intended option is C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the rest mass of the entire nucleus as 6 * (mass of proton + neutron)/2, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the relativistic energy formula E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², but since we're dealing with non-relativistic speeds, perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, no, at 0.96c, it's definitely relativistic.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the energy per nucleon, but no, it's the whole nucleus.

Hmm. I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the calculations, the correct energy is approximately 20.1 GeV when using the sum of individual nucleon masses, and approximately 20.01 GeV when using the exact mass of Li-6. Since the options don't have 20.01, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Let me check the exact value. The exact mass of Li-6 is about 6.01507 u. So 6.01507 u *931.5 MeV/u = 5603.03785 MeV =5.60303785 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60303785 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.60303785.

3 *5.60303785 =16.80911355.

0.57142857 *5.60303785.

0.5 *5.60303785 =2.801518925.

0.07142857 *5.60303785 ≈0.40021232.

So 2.801518925 +0.40021232 =3.201731245.

Adding to 16.80911355: 16.80911355 +3.201731245 =20.0108448 GeV.

So about 20.0108 GeV.

None of the options match this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using 6 *938 MeV, leading to 20.100 GeV, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the rest mass as 6 *938.272 MeV (exact proton mass). Let me check: the proton mass is approximately 938.272 MeV/c².

So 6 *938.272 =5629.632 MeV=5.629632 GeV.

So E=gamma * m_rest =3.57142857 *5.629632.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.629632.

3 *5.629632=16.888896.

0.57142857 *5.629632.

0.5 *5.629632=2.814816.

0.07142857 *5.629632 ≈0.4032.

So 2.814816 +0.4032=3.218016.

Adding to 16.888896: 16.888896 +3.218016=20.106912 GeV.

So approximately 20.1069 GeV.

Hmm, so that's about 20.107 GeV. Which would round to 20.107 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is higher by 0.025 GeV. So perhaps the rest mass is taken as 6 *938.3 MeV, leading to a slightly higher energy.

But I'm not sure. Based on the calculations, the correct energy should be around 20.1 GeV when using the sum of individual nucleon masses, or about 20.01 GeV when using the exact mass. Since the options don't have these, perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation was done with more precise gamma and rest mass, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. But I can't see where.

In conclusion, the correct energy is approximately 20.10 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but another possible correct answer is not listed. However, given the options, I'll select option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus X (Li-6) is moving at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_{\text{rest}} c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( m_{\text{rest}} \) is the rest mass of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857
\]

### Step 2: Determine the rest mass energy of Li-6
Li-6 has a mass of approximately \( 6.015 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Converting to GeV:
\[
m_{\text{rest}} = 6.015 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5.603 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total energy
Using \( E = \gamma m_{\text{rest}} \):
\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.603 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this into parts:
\[
3.57142857 \times 5 = 17.85714285, \quad 3.57142857 \times 0.603 \approx 2.153571428
\]
\[
E = 17.85714285 + 2.153571428 \approx 20.01071428 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.01 \, \text{GeV} \). However, none of the options exactly match this value. The closest option is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which is slightly higher. It is possible that the problem assumes a slightly different rest mass or approximates \( \gamma \) differently.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculations, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: C**
