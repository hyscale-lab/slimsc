Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the mass of the stars is the same for both systems, and the planets have similar masses.

The first part says that Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift. Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i) where v is the velocity of the star. But how does K relate to the orbital period?

Oh right, the RV method's semi-amplitude K depends on several factors. The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) ) ) )^(1/3), but since e is zero here (circ orbits), that simplifies a bit. Also, M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period. Let me recall the formula. K is proportional to (M_p / M_*) * ( (1) / ( (P * (1 year in seconds)) )^(1/3) ) ) / ( (1 AU)^(1/3) ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that connects K with the orbital period and the mass of the star.

Another approach: The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so it becomes:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) )

But wait, since both stars have the same mass (same as Sun), and the planets have similar masses, M_p is the same for both. So let's call M_p1 = M_p2 = M_p.

So, K1 = ( (2π G) / (c P1) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) )

Similarly, K2 = ( (2π G) / (c P2) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / M_*^(2/3) )

Dividing K2 by K1 gives:

K2/K1 = [ ( (2π G)/(c P2) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ] / [ ( (2π G)/(c P1) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ]

Simplify this. The M_p and M_* terms cancel out. So:

K2/K1 = [ ( (1/P2) )^(1/3) ) ] / [ ( (1/P1) )^(1/3) ) ]

Which simplifies to (P1/P2)^(1/3). Because (1/P2)^(1/3) divided by (1/P1)^(1/3) is (P1/P2)^(1/3).

So, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3).

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7. So K2/K1 is 7/5 = 1.4.

So, 1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We can cube both sides to solve for P1/P2.

(1.4)^3 = P1/P2

1.4 cubed is approximately 2.744.

So, P1/P2 ≈ 2.744. That means P2 is P1 divided by 2.744.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is than planet #1. So that's P2 / P1.

So, P2/P1 = 1 / (P1/P2) ) = 1 / 2.744 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but that would mean P
