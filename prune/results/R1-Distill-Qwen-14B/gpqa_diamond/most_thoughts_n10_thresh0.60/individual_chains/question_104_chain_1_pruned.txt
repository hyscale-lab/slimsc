Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull, making the star move. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, or maybe the closer it is?

Wait, the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune, so their masses are about the same. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun. So, the only differences are the Doppler shifts observed, which are 5 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #1 and #2, respectively.

I'm a bit confused. So, the RV method measures the star's velocity toward or away from us. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) ), but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I think the formula relates the velocity semi-amplitude to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the star's mass.

Wait, another approach. The RV signal (the semi-amplitude K) depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but it's circular, so maybe i=90 degrees, which makes sin i =1), the star's mass, and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) * (P/(1 yr))^(âˆ’1/3) ) / (M_star^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Doppler shift being related to the star's velocity. The semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure about the exact relationship.

Wait, another thought. The RV method gives a velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. So K is given by ( (M
