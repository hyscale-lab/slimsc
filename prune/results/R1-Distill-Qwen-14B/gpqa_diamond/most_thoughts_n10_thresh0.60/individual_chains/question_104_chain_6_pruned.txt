Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like in mass. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected these planets by measuring shifts in the spectral lines of the stars.

So, the key here is understanding how the RV method works. From what I remember, the RV method detects the Doppler shift caused by the star moving due to the planet's gravity. The star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The planet's gravity makes the star move a little, and that movement changes the wavelength of the spectral lines we observe—this is the Doppler effect.

The size of the shift depends on a few factors. The formula I think is something like the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ) ... Wait, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis) of the planet's orbit.

Wait, another approach: the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital parameters. The formula for K is K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) ... Or something like that. But maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, another thought: the RV signal is inversely related to the orbital period. Because if a planet has a longer orbital period, the star's velocity change is smaller. Or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, no. The RV semi-amplitude K depends on (M_p / M_star) * (1/(P))^(1/3) ) or something like that. Because
