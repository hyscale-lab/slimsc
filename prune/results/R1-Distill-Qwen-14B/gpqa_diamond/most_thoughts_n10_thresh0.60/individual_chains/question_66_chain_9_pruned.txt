Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what's SMEFT again? From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model's gauge symmetry. So it's a way to parameterize physics beyond the SM, like when you don't know the exact new physics but want to write down all possible interactions.

Now, the symmetries. Let me go through each one.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I think SMEFT operators are built respecting Lorentz symmetry. Because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant, and SMEFT just adds higher-dimension terms that still fit within the SM's symmetries. So yes, they must respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, SMEFT is a effective theory valid at a certain scale, maybe not considering all scales. Wait, no, effective field theories usually still respect Poincare symmetry because they're Lorentz invariant and translation invariant. Because in SMEFT, the operators are local, so yes, Poincare must be respected. So both Lorentz and Poincare would be required.

Wait, but wait. Poincare includes the full
