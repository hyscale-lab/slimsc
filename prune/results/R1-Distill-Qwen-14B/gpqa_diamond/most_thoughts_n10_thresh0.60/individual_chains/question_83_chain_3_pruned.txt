Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm. So first, they dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, what's the setup here? So, when you mix two solutions, the volume changes. The initial solution is 20 cm³, then you add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. But what about the concentration?

Let me think. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when you dilute it, the concentration decreases. So first, I should calculate the concentration after dilution.

Originally, the amount of acetic acid is Molarity * Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles / volume, which is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh wait, that's 25 mM. Right, because 0.025 is 2.5e-2, so 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Because when you dilute a weak acid, does the dissociation change? Oh, right, but when calculating the initial concentration after dilution, we just consider the dilution, not the dissociation yet. So yes, the concentration becomes 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with acetic acid in a 1:1 mole ratio. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, how much acetic acid do we have after dilution? Oh, we already calculated that it's 0.001 moles. So, the moles of NaOH needed to reach equivalence is 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume needed is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So when we reach 10 cm³ of NaOH added, that's 100% titration. But the question asks for 25% titration and equivalence point.

Wait, 25% of what? Oh, I think it refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume
