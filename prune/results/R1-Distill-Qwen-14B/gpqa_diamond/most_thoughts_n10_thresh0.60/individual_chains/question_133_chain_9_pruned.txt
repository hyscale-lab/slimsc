Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of phosphate buffer problems. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in a solution. The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³ and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with buffer solutions, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful. But wait, what's the buffer here? Let me think. The substances involved are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I think these are phosphate buffer components. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which should be H2PO4^- (since K+ is the cation). Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium phosphate dihydrate, which is HPO4^2- (since Na+ is the cation). 

So, the solution is a buffer containing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The Ka that's relevant here would be Ka2 because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (so it's the second dissociation step). 

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So, the equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Wait, but I don't know the pH of the solution. Oh, wait, maybe I can calculate it using the concentrations of the two components. But wait, I don't have the pH given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH of the solution using the given masses and then apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the ratio, which will help me find the concentration of orthophosphate.

Wait, no. Wait, but the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are HPO4^2-. So, maybe I don't need the pH but just the ratio of the base to the acid to find their concentrations and then find the molarity.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.
2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to relate their concentrations, considering Ka2.
4. But wait, if the solution is a buffer, the pH should relate to the ratio of [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO
