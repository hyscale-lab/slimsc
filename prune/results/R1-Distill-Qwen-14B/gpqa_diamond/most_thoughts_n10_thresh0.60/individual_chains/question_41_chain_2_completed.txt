Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about light propagating through a moving glass. Let me think through it step by step.

So the question says: A light beam is moving through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with velocities in different reference frames, we might need to use the velocity addition formulas from special relativity. But wait, this is about light, and I thought in a medium, the speed of light isn't c anymore. Oh right, in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c/n. Because the standard formula is v = c/n. So when the glass is stationary, the light's speed is c/n.

But now the glass is moving. So how does that affect the measured speed of the light in the lab frame? Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. Or wait, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Let me clarify the setup: the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going, say, to the right, and the glass is also moving to the right with velocity v. So from the lab frame, what do you see?

Wait, no. Wait the beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's movement. So the glass is moving toward the observer? Or is the beam moving towards the observer?

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. Wait, no: the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me re-read that part.

Ah, "the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." Hmm, so the beam is moving in one direction, and the glass is moving in that same direction as well, but toward the observer. Wait, that seems contradictory unless the observer is in front of the beam's direction. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. So the beam is leaving the glass towards the observer, and the glass itself is moving in the same direction as the beam as it's being emitted. Because if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is moving in the same direction (so towards the observer as well), then their velocities add up in that direction.

Wait, no. Let me think. The observer is in the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the observer is in front of the beam's direction. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam inside the glass is moving towards the observer, but through a moving medium.

So from the lab frame, the light's speed is not simply c/n plus v because that's the Galilean addition, which isn't correct at high speeds. But since light is involved, maybe we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, we need to transform the velocities.

Relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). Wait, but in this case, the light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n. So u' is the speed in the lab frame.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So when we observe an object moving at u in the glass's frame, its speed in the lab is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c^2)).

But in this case, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So u is the speed of light in the glass, which is c/n towards the observer. So u = c/n. Then, applying the formula, the lab frame speed would be u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/n) * v / c² )

Wait, let's compute that. The denominator becomes 1 + (v)/(n c), because (c/n)*v /c² = v/(n c).

So u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + v/(n c)).

Hmm. Let me factor this. The numerator is (c + n v)/n, denominator is (n c + v)/(n c).

So when I divide them, u' = [(c + n v)/n ] * [n c / (n c + v)] )

The n's cancel out, so u' = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, numerator is (c/n + v) = (c + n v)/n.

Denominator is (1 + (v c)/(n c^2)) ) = 1 + v/(n c).

Wait, that's incorrect. Let me recheck the denominator calculation. The denominator is 1 + (u v)/c². u is c/n, so (c/n)*v /c² = v/(n c). So denominator is 1 + (v/(n c)).

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Because denominator: 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So u' = [ (c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

Wait, let's compute that:

Numerators: (c + n v) * n c

Denominator: n (n c + v)

Wait, wait, the first numerator is (c + n v) /n and the denominator is (n c + v)/(n c). So when you divide, it's (c + n v)/(n) ) * (n c)/(n c + v) )

Which is (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, because n cancels in numerator and denominator. Let's see:

The denominator (n c + v) is same as (v + n c). So numerator is (c + n v) * c.

Wait, let's factor numerator and denominator. Let's see:

Numerator: c (1 + n v/c )

Denominator: n c + v = v + n c = v (1 + (n c)/v ) = but that might not help.

Alternatively, factor numerator: c + n v = n v + c.

Denominator: n c + v.

Wait, perhaps it can be written as (n v + c) * c / (n c + v) ) = c (n v + c) / (n c + v )

Hmm. Let me see if I can factor this differently. Let me factor numerator and denominator by n or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out terms to see if it's one of the options.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)

Option B: 1

Option C: (1 + n v)/(n - v)

Option D: (1 - n v)/(n + v)

Hmm, none of them directly match. But perhaps I made an error in applying the formula.

Wait another approach: perhaps in the lab frame, the speed of the light in the glass is c/n. Because the medium is moving, but light speed in the medium is c/n regardless of the medium's motion. Wait, but that might not be correct because from the lab's perspective, the medium is moving, so the light's speed might change.

Wait, no. Because in classical physics, you could just add velocities. But in reality, because of relativity, you can't. But in a medium, the light's speed is determined by the medium's properties. Wait, but if the medium is moving, does that affect the speed? Or is the speed of light in the medium always c/n, regardless of the medium's movement?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the medium's frame. In the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n towards the observer. Since the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v, from the lab's frame, the light's speed is u' = (c/n + v)/(1 + (c/(n c^2)) v )

Which simplifies to (c + n v)/n / (1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, that's the same as before.

Wait, but in the options, I don't see that. Wait, let's compute the expression I got.

u' = [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

Wait, but let me factor this differently. Let me write it as:

u' = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Divide numerator and denominator by c:

u' = (c + n v ) / (n + v / c )

But v is much smaller than c, so v/c is negligible. Then u' approximates to (c + n v)/n ≈ c/n (1 + (n v)/c ) ≈ c/n + v. Which would be the Galilean addition. But relativity says it's not exactly that.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are like this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with the Galilean addition, assuming v is much smaller than c. Then u = c/n, so u' = u + v = c/n + v. But that doesn't match any options either.

Wait, the options given are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v)

B) 1

C) (1 +n v)/(n-v)

D) (1 -n v)/(n +v)

Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the speed of light in the glass as (c/n) in its rest frame, and then using the relativistic formula to find the speed in the lab frame.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the glass's frame. In that frame, the light is moving at u = c/n.

Now, the lab is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving at v in the lab frame). So to find the speed of the light in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass, we apply the velocity addition formula.

u' = (u + v')/(1 + (u v')/c² )

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity in the original frame (glass), and v is the velocity of the original frame (glass) relative to the new frame (lab).

So in this case, u = c/n (light's speed in glass frame), and the glass is moving at v in the lab frame, so to get the light's speed in lab, u' = (c/n + v) / (1 + (c/(n c² )) v )

Which is the same as (c + n v)/n / (1 + v/(n c) )

Wait, same as before.

But the options don't have this. Let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the expression. Let me factor the numerator and denominator:

u' = [ (c + n v) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c) ) ]

= [ (c + n v) * c ] / (n c + v )

= c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Hmm. Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, in the numerator: c (c + n v) = c^2 + n v c.

Denominator: n c + v = v + n c.

Wait, so u' = (c^2 + n v c) / (n c + v )

Hmm. Let me factor c out of the denominator: c (n + v/(c) )

So u' = [ c (c + n v) ] / [ c (n + v/c ) ].

The c's cancel, so u' = (c + n v) / (n + v/c )

Hmm. Let's write it as [ (c + n v) ] / [ (n c + v ) / c ]

Wait, perhaps I can write the denominator as (n c + v ) / c = n + v/c.

So u' = [ (c + n v) ] / (n + v/c )

Hmm. Let me multiply numerator and denominator by c to eliminate the fraction in the denominator.

So:

u' = [ (c + n v ) * c ] / [ (n c + v ) ]

Which brings me back to where I was before.

Wait, perhaps I should factor n v from the numerator and denominator.

Wait, not sure. Let me think again. The options don't match this expression.

Wait, I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v)

If I set c=1, which the problem says to do, then my expression becomes:

u' = (1 +n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, with c=1, it's (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is option A. Ah! So when c=1, the expression becomes (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which is option A.

Ah, so that's the answer. So when c=1, u' = (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Wait, but why does the speed of light in the lab frame become (1 +n v)/(n +v ) when c=1? Because in this case, the light's speed is measured using relativistic addition, and when c=1, it's (1 +n v)/(n +v ). But wait, when v is much smaller than 1, what happens?

Let's do a sanity check. If v is 0, then u' is (1 +0)/(n +0) = 1/n, which makes sense because in the glass's rest frame, the speed is 1/n. So that's correct.

If v is non-zero but small, u' ≈ (1 +n v) / (n ) ≈ (1/n) (1 + v/(n c) ) Wait, but with c=1, it's (1/n) (1 + v/n ). Hmm, but that doesn't align with Galilean addition. Wait, if v is small, then u' ≈ (1 + n v )/(n ) = 1/n + v. Which is the same as Galilean addition: c_medium + v = (1/n) + v.

But according to relativity, the correct addition would be u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v) ), but when u and v are small, it approximates to u + v. So here, our result when v is small gives 1/n + v, which is correct.

Wait, but in our case, the speed is (1 + n v)/(n + v ) when c=1. Let's see what it is for small v.

(1 + n v)/(n + v) ≈ (1 +n v )/(n) [since v is much smaller than n] → 1/n + v/(n^2 )

Wait, that's different from the Galilean approximation, which would be 1/n + v.

Hmm, so our result doesn't match the Galilean approximation. That's a problem because, for small v, the velocities should add linearly.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Let me re-calculate the velocity addition.

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v) )

Wait, no. The correct formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Ah, right, I forgot the c squared. So in terms of c=1, it's (u + v)/(1 + u v )

Because when c=1, 1 + (u v)/c² = 1 + u v.

So with u = c/n = 1/n, and v is the velocity of the glass (same direction as u).

So u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

= (1 + n v) / (n + v )

So when c=1, u' = (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

But wait, when v is small, this becomes (1 +n v )/(n + v ) ≈ [1 + n v ]/(n) (since v is small compared to n) → 1/n + v.

Which matches the Galilean addition, since for small v, (u + v)/(1 + u v ) ≈ u + v (because u v is small and denominator is ~1).

So the approximation works out, which gives me more confidence that option A is correct.

But wait, the question is about what the speed of light is in the glass relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the speed is c/n, but when the glass is moving, the lab sees it as (1 +n v)/(n +v ). But wait, that can't be larger than 1, can it? Because the speed of light must be less than or equal to 1 (since c=1), but if (1 +n v) is larger than (n +v ), then the fraction would be more than 1, which is impossible.

Wait, so for instance, suppose n=1, v=0.5.

Then (1 +1 *0.5)/(1 +0.5) = 1.5/1.5 =1. Which is okay.

If n=1, v=0.8, then (1 + 0.8)/(1+0.8 ) =1.8/1.8 =1.

Hmm, so in that case, it's exactly 1. So no problem.

Another case: n=2, v=0.5.

u' = (1 + 2*0.5)/(2 +0.5 )= (2)/(2.5 )= 0.8 <1.

Yes, that's correct.

Another case: n=0.5, v=0.5.

u' = (1 +0.5 *0.5 )/(0.5 +0.5 )= (1.25)/1 =1.25>1. Which can't be right. But n can't be less than 1 for glass, because glass has higher refractive index than air. So n=0.5 is not a realistic case. So the formula works as long as n ≥1.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in glass is always c/n, which is less than c. But according to this formula, when the glass is moving, the observed speed could approach 1, which is c, but never exceed it.

Wait, but if n=1 and v=0.9, then u' = (1 +1 *0.9)/(1 +0.9 )=1.9/1.9=1. So exactly c.

Which makes sense because if the medium is moving at velocity v, and in its frame the light is moving at c, then the lab frame would see the light moving at c as well. Hmm, but wait, that's because when the medium is moving at v, and the light is also moving at v in the same direction, their speeds add relativistically to c.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the glass is moving at v, and the light in the glass is moving at c/n. So when n=1, it's moving at c, same as the glass's velocity. So the light's speed in the lab would be c, as per the formula.

Wait, but another way to think: if the glass is moving at speed v, and the light is moving at speed v in the same direction (so from the lab frame, the light would be moving at v + v = 2v, which would be wrong because it can't exceed c). But according to the relativistic formula, when the light's speed in the medium is v (c/n= v), then u' = (v + v)/(1 + v^2 ) = 2v/(1 +v^2 ), which is less than c if v is less than c. But in the formula I derived earlier, for n=1, u' is (1 +v )/(1 +v ), which is 1. So when n=1, the formula gives u'=1.

Which is c, which makes sense because if the light is moving at the same speed as the glass, then in the lab frame, it's moving at c, but that's only when the glass is moving at v = (c^2 - u_medium^2 )/(2 c^2 ) or something, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

In any case, the formula works as per the options given, and the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The light beam propagates through the glass with a refractive index \( n \), and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Speed of Light in the Glass (Rest Frame of the Glass):**  
   In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( c/n \), where \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem). Thus, the speed of light in the glass is \( u = 1/n \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition:**  
   To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + uv}
   \]  
   Here, \( u = 1/n \) (speed of light in the glass's frame), and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory.

3. **Substitute \( u = 1/n \) into the Formula:**  
   Substituting \( u = 1/n \) into the formula gives:  
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n}v}
   \]  
   Simplify the numerator and denominator by multiplying through by \( n \):  
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Final Expression for \( u' \):**  
   The speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory is:  
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]

5. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The derived expression matches **Option A**, which is \( \frac{1 + nv}{n + v} \).

### Sanity Checks:
- If \( v = 0 \) (glass is stationary), \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), which is correct for light in a medium.
- If \( v \) is small compared to \( n \), the expression approximates to \( \frac{1}{n} + v \), consistent with Galilean addition for low velocities.
- For \( n = 1 \), the expression simplifies to \( \frac{1 + v}{1 + v} = 1 \), which is consistent with the speed of light being \( c \) in a vacuum.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
