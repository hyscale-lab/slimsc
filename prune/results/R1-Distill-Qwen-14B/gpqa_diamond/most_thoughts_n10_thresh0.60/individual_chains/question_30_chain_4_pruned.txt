Okay, so I've got this question here about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I need to figure out what color it absorbs. Wait, I remember something about complementary colors and how absorption relates to emission.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Oh right, when a substance emits light, it's because the electrons drop from a higher energy state to a lower one, releasing energy as photons. But wait, the color emitted isn't the same as the color absorbed. Oh right, the color absorbed is the complementary color of what's emitted. Because if a material emits green light, it probably absorbed red or something.

So first, I need to find out what color corresponds to 2.3393 eV. Let me think about the energy of visible light. I remember that higher energy photons are towards the blue/violet end, and lower energy towards red. The energy E is related to wavelength by E=hc/Î». But wait, maybe I can recall some approximate values for colors.

I think each color has a typical photon energy. Red is lower energy, around 1.8-2.1 eV perhaps. Orange might be around 2.1 eV. Yellow maybe a bit higher, maybe 2.2 eV? Green is around 2.3-2.4 eV perhaps. Wait, so if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, that's in the green range. Let me check the exact color order.

Wait, let's see. Visible light wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm. The energy E in eV
