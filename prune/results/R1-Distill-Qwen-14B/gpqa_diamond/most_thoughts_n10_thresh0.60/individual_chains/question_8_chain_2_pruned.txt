Okay, so I have this genetics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about gene interactions related to disease resistance in white lupine. They've done some experiments with knock-out mutants and double mutants, and I have to figure out the gene relationships based on the results.

Alright, let's start by understanding what each of these terms means. So, a knock-out mutant is when a gene is disabled, right? So, if a plant is g1, it means the G1 gene isn't working. Similarly for g2 and g3.

The experiment tests the resistance to anthracnose. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. Each mutant's resistance is a percentage compared to this. So lower percentages mean more susceptibility, which means the gene product is important for resistance.

The data given:
- g1: 75% → so it's less resistant than wild type. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% → no resistance at all. So G2 is super important. When G2 is knocked out, plants can't resist the fungus.
- g3: 50% → so G3 is also important, but less so than G2. Half the resistance.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → very low resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's worse than either alone.
  - g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone. So adding g3 on top of g2 doesn't make it worse; it's the same as g2 alone.
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone. So when g1 and g2 are both knocked out, the resistance is zero.

Wait, but when you knock out both g1 and g2, the resistance is same as g2 alone (0%). That's interesting. Maybe one is upstream of the other?

Also, the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. Transcription factors usually regulate other genes, so their role is more upstream in a signaling pathway.

Let me try to model this. Let's think about the possible pathways.

First, G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. That suggests that G2 is essential for any resistance. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes needed for resistance. If G2 isn't working, none of the downstream genes are expressed.

Looking at G1: when G1 is knocked out, resistance is 75%. That's a 25% reduction. So G1's product contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor. So G1 might be part of a pathway that's partially independent of G2? Or maybe it's downstream of G2.

Wait, but when both G1 and G2 are knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. That suggests that G1's function is additive on top of G2. Or perhaps G1 is downstream of G2. Because when G2 is knocked out, even if G1 is also knocked out, the resistance remains the same. So maybe G2's product is upstream, and G1 is downstream. So G2 activates G1, perhaps?

Wait, but then what about the double mutant g1g3? That gives 10% resistance, which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. But when both are knocked out, the effect is additive (or worse than either alone). 

So considering that, let me try to sketch a possible pathway:

G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. So G2 → G1 and G2 → G3. In this case, knocking out G2 would disable both downstream genes, leading to 0% resistance. That aligns with g2's result.

But wait, G1's knockout alone gives 75% resistance. So if G1 is downstream of G2, then knocking out G1 would lose some but not all resistance. That makes sense because G3 is still active. So when G1 is out, only G3's product is present, which gives 75% (maybe G3 contributes 50% on its own, and G1 adds 25%? Or something like that.)

Wait, G3 knockout is 50% resistance. So when G3 is not working, the resistance is halved. So in the wild type, maybe the total resistance is a combination of G1 and G3 pathways.

So if G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then in the g2 mutant, both are inactive, hence 0% resistance. In the g3 mutant,
