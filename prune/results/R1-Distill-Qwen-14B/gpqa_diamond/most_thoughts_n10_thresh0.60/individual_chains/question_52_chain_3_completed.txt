Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Hmm, dark spots on a star, like sunspots, are cooler regions. So when a significant portion of the star's surface is covered by these spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. Got it. But the key part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, and we need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, I remember that the ratio of populations in different energy levels depends on the temperature. This is based on the Boltzmann equation, which relates the number of particles in two energy states. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) ), where g is the degeneracy, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the overall temperature is lower, so what does that mean for the ratio? 

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I'm not sure if the wavelength is important here, but maybe it's related to the energy difference between the levels. Let's think. Wavelength λ is related to energy E by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is speed of light. So the energy difference between the two levels (E2 - E1) would be hc/(λ). 

Let me calculate that. Hmm, but maybe I don't need the exact value because it will cancel out in the ratio. Let's see. 

The ratio when no spots (T1=6000 K) is R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ), and when spots (T2=5500 K) is R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). The factor by which the ratio changes is R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ) * (g1/g2 ratio?), wait no, because g2/g1 is same in both. So R1/R2 would be exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ).

Wait, no. Because the ratio R is n2/n1. When the temperature changes from T1 to T2, the ratio changes from R1 to R2. The factor is R1 / R2. So:

R1/R2 = [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ] 

The (g2/g1) terms cancel out, so R1/R2 = exp( [ ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) + (ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) 

Wait, no. Let me write it correctly. 

R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ] ) 

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Ah, right. Because [ (-Δ)/(k T1) ) + (Δ)/(k T2) ) ] = Δ/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Wait, let's compute that exponent. Let me compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) first. 

T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K.

1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667 K^-1

1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182 K^-1

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515 K^-1

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * 0.00001515.

But wait, what's ΔE? It's the energy difference between the two levels, which is hc/λ. Let's compute that.

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, about 3 x 10^8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Ångströms. Since 1 Å is 1e-10 meters, so 1448 Å = 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Let me compute this. 

First, multiply 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, but wait. Let me do that calculation more accurately.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact, since it's defined now)

c=299792458 m/s. But maybe for approximation, 3e8 is okay.

λ = 1448e-10 m.

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

ΔE = 1.9878e-25 / (1.448e-7) = let's compute 1.9878 /1.448 ≈ 1.373, and the exponents: 1e-25 /1e-7 = 1e-18. So ΔE≈1.373e-18 J per photon.

But wait, we can also express this in terms of eV because sometimes it's easier. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.373e-18 J = (1.373e-18)/(1.602e-19) ≈ 8.57 eV. 

Wait, that seems high. Hmm, because 10 eV is about 124 nm, so 8.57 eV would be about 145 nm, which is close to 1448 Å (which is 144.8 nm), so that makes sense. Yeah, so the energy difference is about 8.57 eV. 

So going back, the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1). 

Wait, but wait, the exponent is [ΔE/(k)] * (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)).

Wait, but T2 is 5500 K, so 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So (1/T2 - 1/T1) is positive. So the exponent is positive times (ΔE/k). 

But ΔE is positive, so the exponent is positive. So exp(positive) => R1/R2 is greater than 1. So the ratio R1 is higher than R2. But the problem states that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio R (n2/n1) decreases. So R1 is when no spots, R2 when spots. So R1 > R2, which matches the statement in the problem that the ratio decreases when spots are present. 

So R1/R2 is exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 -1/T1) ). Let's compute this value.

We have ΔE in J: 1.373e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.380649e-23 ≈ let's compute that.

1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 ≈ approx 0.995 * 1e5 ≈ 99500.

Wait, 1e-18 divided by 1e-23 is 1e5. So 1.373 /1.38 is approx 0.995, so 99500. So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute that more accurately.

1.373e-18 / 1.380649e-23 = (1.373 / 1.380649) * 1e5.

1.373 /1.380649 ≈ 0.9943.

So 0.9943e5 = 99430, approximately 99430 K.

So the exponent is 99430 K * (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Let me compute (1/5500 -1/6000) as I did earlier.

Which is 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000≈0.000166667.

Subtracting, 0.000015152.

So 99430 * 0.000015152 ≈ let's calculate.

99430 * 0.000015152 = 99430 * 1.5152e-5.

Let me compute 99430 * 1.5152e-5.

1e5 is 100,000. So 99430 is about 9.943e4.

So 9.943e4 * 1.5152e-5 = 9.943 * 1.5152 * 1e-1.

Compute 9.943 * 1.5152 ≈ let's see:

10 * 1.5152 is 15.152, but since it's 9.943, that's about 0.057 less. So 15.152 - (0.057 *1.5152) ≈ 15.152 - 0.086 ≈ 15.066.

Multiply by 0.1 (1e-1): 1.5066.

So the exponent is approximately 1.5066.

So the ratio R1/R2 is exp(1.5066) ≈ e^1.5066.

I know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let's compute e^1.5066.

We can use a calculator approximation. Let's think about:

ln(4.5)= approximately 1.504. Because ln(4)=1.386, ln(4.5)=?

Wait, let me compute e^1.5066:

We can think, 1.5066 is close to 1.504, which is ln(4.5)=1.5040774.

So e^1.5066 ≈ 4.5 * e^(0.00253).

e^0.00253 ≈ 1 + 0.00253 + (0.00253)^2/2 ≈ about 1.002533.

So 4.5 * 1.002533 ≈ 4.5114.

So approximately 4.51.

Wait, but wait, the exponent is 1.5066, which is a bit more than 1.504. So e^1.5066 ≈ 4.5 * 1.0025 ≈ 4.51.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but let me cross-verify the calculations. Because sometimes I make mistakes in the exponents.

Let me go through the steps again.

Compute (1/T2 -1/T1) = (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500 *6000) ) = 500/(3.3e7) ) = 5e2 /3.3e7 = 5/(3.3e5) ) ≈ 1.515e-6 (Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 0.00001515, which is 1.515e-5. So which is correct?

Wait, 1/5500 = ~1.818e-4, 1/6000= ~1.6667e-4. The difference is 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = 1.513e-5, which is 0.00001513 K^-1.

So 1.513e-5 K^-1.

Then, (ΔE/k) is approximately 99430 K, as before.

So the product is 99430 * 1.513e-5 = 99430 * 1.513e-5.

Multiply 99430 by 1.513e-5:

= (9.943e4) * (1.513e-5) = 9.943 * 1.513 * 1e-1.

Compute 9.943 * 1.513:

Let me compute 10 *1.513 =15.13. So 9.943 is 10 - 0.057, so 15.13 - (0.057 *1.513) ≈ 15.13 - 0.086 ≈15.044.

Multiply by 0.1: 1.5044.

So exponent is 1.5044.

e^1.5044 is e^(ln(4.5)) =4.5, exactly. Because ln(4.5)=1.504077.

So e^1.5044 is approximately 4.5.

So R1/R2=4.5.

Which is option C.

So the answer should be C) ~4.5.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no dark spots (Teff = 6000 K) to having 40% of its surface covered by spots (Teff = 5500 K). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_1\) and \(g_2\) are the degeneracies of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is given by:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
\]

where \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are the ratios at temperatures \(T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K}\), respectively. The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is calculated using the wavelength of the transition (\(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\)):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting \(\Delta E\) to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Next, the ratio \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) is calculated:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667 \, \text{K}^{-1},
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The term \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\) is computed using \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99430 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting into the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = 99430 \times 0.0000151 \approx 1.504.
\]

Finally, the factor is:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.504) \approx 4.5.
\]

Thus, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star has spots compared to when it does not.
