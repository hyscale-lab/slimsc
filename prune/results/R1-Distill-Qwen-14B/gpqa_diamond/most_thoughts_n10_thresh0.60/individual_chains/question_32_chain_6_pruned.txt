Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is about finding the energy of the collider when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy isn't just kinetic; it's relativistic. Right, so this must involve the concept of relativistic energy.

Wait, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons added to the 3 protons (since Li has atomic number 3). So the mass number A is 6. So the mass of the nucleus is important here. I think I'll need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus to compute its relativistic energy.

So the problem is to find the total energy of the nucleus when moving at 0.96c. The energy in relativity is given by the equation E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

Let me jot that down. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). If v is 0.96c, then v² is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

But wait, I should be precise here because the options are given to four decimal places. Let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute (v/c)^2 first. 0.96 squared is exactly 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So now the energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The rest mass energy is m * c². But what's the mass of Li-6?

Hmm, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus. I think I should look up the atomic mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it based on the number of protons and neutrons. Let me recall that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for a neutron. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total mass would be (3*938) + (3*939.5656) MeV/c², because wait, neutron is slightly heavier than proton. Oh wait, the exact
