Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is about finding the energy of the collider when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. RHIC collides heavy ions, right? So in this case, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, so I should figure out its atomic number and mass number. Let me think: Lithium typically has an atomic number (protons) of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So it's Li-6. That makes sense because Li-6 is a common isotope used in such experiments.

The problem states that the speed of the nucleus X (which is Li-6) is 0.96c. And we need to find the energy of RHIC. I think in particle colliders, the energy is the kinetic energy, but wait—the question says "energy of the collider," which might refer to the total energy. Or maybe it's the kinetic energy. I'll have to be careful here.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy comes into play here. The total energy (E) of a particle is given by gamma * m0 c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy (K) is E - m0 c², which is (gamma - 1) m0 c².

So the question is, do we need to find the total energy (gamma m0c²) or the kinetic energy (gamma-1 m0c²)? The question says "energy of the RHIC," which I think is the kinetic energy imparted to the ion, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm. I'll check the options later, but maybe I should calculate both and see which makes sense.

First, let's find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6, so the mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton or neutron. Wait, neutron is slightly heavier than a proton. The proton mass is about 938 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But for approximate calculations, maybe I can use the average or just take the mass of the nucleus as A times the proton mass, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the exact mass number times the mass of a nucleon. Let me think: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so 6 nucleons. The mass of one nucleon is roughly around 938 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus would be 6 * 938 ≈ 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But let me make sure. Hmm, more accurately, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is 939.565 MeV/c². So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.51 MeV, which is 5.63351 GeV. So about 5.634 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Is that the rest mass of the nucleus? Well, in reality, the binding energy is considered, but for heavy ions like Li-6, the mass is close to the sum of the nucleons. But perhaps for this problem, we can approximate the rest mass as 6 * (average of proton and neutron mass). Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the mass of the nucleus as 6 times the proton mass. Well, since the problem doesn't provide the exact mass, I think I'll proceed with 6 * 938.3 MeV
