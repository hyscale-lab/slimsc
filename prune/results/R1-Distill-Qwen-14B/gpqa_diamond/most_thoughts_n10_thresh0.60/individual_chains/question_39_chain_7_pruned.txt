Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let's see... Hmm, okay, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, and when they measured the positions, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So I think this has to do with normalization of the wave function because the probabilities must add up to 1.

Wait, right! The wave function must be normalized, meaning the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. Oh, but wait, the wave function here is given as a complex function. Let me think—the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the complex part is the imaginary unit i multiplied by 0.5.

Oh wait, no, wait a minute. Let me write it down. So ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, no, no, wait! The way the function is written, it's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i. So it's a complex function with a real part and an imaginary part.

Wait, but when we calculate the probability density, it's the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So |ψ(x)|² = [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]². So here, Re(ψ) is a/(sqrt(1+x)), and Im(ψ) is -0.5. So the square would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Oh, because when you square, the negative goes away. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, the wave function must be normalized. So the integral of |ψ|² from x=1 to x=3 equals 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3 = 1.

Let me compute this integral.
