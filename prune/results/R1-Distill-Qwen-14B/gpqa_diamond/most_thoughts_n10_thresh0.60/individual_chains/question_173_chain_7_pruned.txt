Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that an electron is moving at a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy, ΔE, of the electron. The options are given from A to D, with different exponents of 10.

Hmm, I remember that this has to do with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes people use the inequality without the 1/2 factor because it's an estimate, so maybe I can ignore the half for this calculation.

So, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Momentum p is mass times velocity, so I can relate Δp to the uncertainty in velocity Δv, but wait, in this case, we have the speed v given. But I'm a bit confused—do I have Δv or is the speed given as the actual speed? Oh, the question says the electron is traveling with speed v, so I think that Δv might not be given, so perhaps I'll have to proceed using v and the uncertainty in position.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should approach this by considering that the uncertainty in momentum Δp is related to the uncertainty in position Δx. So using Δx * Δp ≈ ħ. Let me see. So Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx), but perhaps for this problem, taking it as ħ/Δx is sufficient.

So, first, I need to compute Δp, then relate it to the uncertainty in energy ΔE. But I'm a bit unsure about the relation between Δp and ΔE. Hmm. Energy is related to momentum through the relativistic energy-momentum relation, but since the speed is 2e8 m/s, which is about 20% of the speed of light (since c is 3e8 m/s), maybe relativistic effects are not negligible. Wait, but wait, 2e8 m/s is about 0.6667 times the speed of light. Wait, no, 2e8 is 200 million meters per second. The speed of light is about 3e8, so 2e8 is two-thirds of the speed of light. Wait, 3e8 is 300 million m/s, so 200 million is two-thirds. That's a significant fraction. So maybe I should use the relativistic formula for energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the non-relativistic approximation. Because if the speed is given as 2e8 m/s and the mass of the electron is known, perhaps using the non-relativistic momentum and kinetic energy is acceptable. But wait, let's think. The non-relativistic kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but when v is a significant fraction of c, using that might lead to a less accurate result. But maybe the problem expects us to proceed non-relativistically. Or perhaps it's a trick question where relativistic effects are important.

Hmm. Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the uncertainty in momentum Δp. Using Heisenberg's principle, Δx * Δp ≈ ħ. So, Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

What's ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But for rough calculations, we can
