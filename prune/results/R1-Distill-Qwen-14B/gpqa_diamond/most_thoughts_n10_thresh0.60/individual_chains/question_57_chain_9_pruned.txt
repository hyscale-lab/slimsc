Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that when particles scatter, especially in nuclear physics, phase shifts come into play. Oh right, this has something to do with scattering theory and partial waves. I think the scattering amplitude is involved here.

The problem gives me phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. And they're asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, I think the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, and the imaginary part relates to something like the differential cross-section.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves, each involving the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts. But since they're asking specifically along the incident beam direction, θ would be 0 degrees. So I should evaluate f(0).

The formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is the sum from l=0 to some maximum of [ (2l + 1) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ) ] divided by (2k i), where k is the wave number. But wait, since we're considering the imaginary part, maybe I can find a simpler expression.

Wait, wait. The imaginary part of f(θ=0) would be the imaginary component of that sum. Let me think about each
