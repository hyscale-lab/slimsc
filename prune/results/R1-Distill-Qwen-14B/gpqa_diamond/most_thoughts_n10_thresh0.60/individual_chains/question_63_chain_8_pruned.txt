Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember from my studies that diatomic molecules have rotational and vibrational energy levels. The question says it's using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, or is that different from the rigid rotor? Right, the rigid rotor model assumes the bond length is fixed, but the non-rigid model allows for some stretching, so it's more accurate for vibrational modes. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So that's probably the ground state. The question is asking what momentum a photon must have to make the molecule transition to the next lowest energy state. So the molecule absorbs a photon and moves to a higher energy state.

I need to figure out the energy difference between the current state and the next state, then find the photon's momentum that corresponds to that energy. Because the energy of a photon is related to its momentum via E = pc/c, but wait, the formula is E = hν, and since p = E/c, that becomes p = hν/(c). Oh wait, no, I think the correct relation is E = pc for photons because their speed is c. So E = pc, so p = E/c. Wait, no, wait. The energy of a photon is E = hν, and since it's massless, its momentum p is E/c. So p
