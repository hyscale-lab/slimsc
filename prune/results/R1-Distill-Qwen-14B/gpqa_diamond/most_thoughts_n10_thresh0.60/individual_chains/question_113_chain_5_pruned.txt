Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll take it step by step.

The question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical O-H stretches. O-H in alcohols is usually broader and around 3300-3500. Oh, but wait, maybe if the compound is something like a carboxylic acid, the O-H is very broad and maybe around 2500-3300. Wait, no, carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 2500-3000. Or maybe it's an alcohol. Alternatively, could it be an ether? No, ethers don't have O-H. So, maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the peak is very broad, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid or perhaps an alcohol. But I'm a bit confused here. Also, another peak at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is indicative
