Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when a certain nucleus, X, is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, let me understand what nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3. So if it has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because protons + neutrons is 3 + 3 =6. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

Now, the energy in a particle accelerator like RHIC is usually the kinetic energy, but wait, in high-energy physics, when they talk about energy, they often mean the total energy, which includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. But sometimes it's the kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to check that.

Wait, the question says, "energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, I think they're referring to the total energy because the speed is given, and we can calculate the gamma factor from that.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute gamma when v=0.96c.

Calculating gamma:
v = 0.96c
So v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216

Then 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784

So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 1/0.28 is about 3.57142857... Yes.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m_rest * c².

But wait, what's the rest mass of Li-6? The rest mass
