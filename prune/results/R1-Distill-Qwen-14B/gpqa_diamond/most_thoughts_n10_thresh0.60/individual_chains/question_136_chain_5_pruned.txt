Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. 

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. That probably means the vector field is directed radially outward or inward, and its magnitude decreases with the square of the distance from the origin.

Wait, so I need to find the divergence of this field and then integrate it over the volume of a sphere. Oh right, the divergence theorem comes into play here, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral, which is the same as the flux through the surface according to the divergence theorem. But wait, the divergence theorem says that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the surface integral of the vector field dotted with the normal vector over the surface. So ∫∇·f dV = ∫f · dA over the surface.

But wait, alternatively, maybe I should calculate the divergence of f first and then integrate it in the volume.

Let me write down what I know. The vector field f(r) has only a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, f = f_r e_r, where e_r is the radial unit vector.

The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r². Wait, but in spherical coordinates, the components can be written in terms of the basis vectors. So the vector field
