Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's used when we consider physics beyond the Standard Model, especially at high energy scales. The idea is that you can write down all possible interactions that respect certain symmetries.

The question lists four symmetries and asks which are mandatory for all operators. The options are combinations of these. Let me think about each symmetry one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think that's a big one. The Standard Model definitely respects Lorentz symmetry, so any effective theory derived from it should also respect that. Because operators in SMEFT are built from the Standard Model fields and their higher-dimensional terms, they should all transform properly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry must be there. That means options without 1 are probably out. Looking at the options, options B and D include other things, but only option C includes 1,2,4. Hmm, but wait, let me check each point.

Second, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shift in space and time). Since the SM respects Poincare, all SMEFT operators should too. But wait, is there a reason why SMEFT operators might not respect Poincare? I don't think so. All operators would have to be constructed in a way that's invariant under Poincare, which includes Lorentz and momentum conservation. So I think both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Third, CP symmetry. I remember that the Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry. For example, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP. But wait, do all operators have to respect CP? No, because the effective theory can include terms that break CP. So I don't think CP symmetry is a must. So option 3 is not necessarily required.

Fourth, CPT symmetry. The Standard Model respects CPT symmetry. I think CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Since the SM includes CPT, SMEFT operators must also respect CPT. Otherwise, the theory would lead to violations in a way that's not compatible with the SM. So option 4 is correct.

So putting it all together. The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the required symmetries are 1,2,4. Now looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option C is A) 1,2; B)3,4; C) 1,2,4; D)1,3,4. So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. SMEFT operators are constructed from the SM fields, and the SM respects CPT. So any operator in SMEFT must respect CPT. So yes, option 4 is correct. Also, Poincare is more than just Lorentz; it includes translations. But all operators in the SM are local, so they respect Poincare. So in SMEFT, operators are local, so yes, Poincare symmetry is required. So the answer should include 1,2,4, which is option C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT is derived from the SM. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry and SMEFT is built from SM fields, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Poincaré symmetry.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation in the CKM matrix). Consequently, operators in SMEFT are not required to respect CP symmetry, as CP violation can be included in the theory.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and SMEFT, being an effective theory derived from the SM, must also respect CPT symmetry. Violations of CPT symmetry would lead to inconsistencies with the SM.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C**.

Answer: C
