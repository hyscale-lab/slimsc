Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde, and we need to figure out the number of carbon atoms in the final product, product 3.

First, let's break down each step. I remember that each reaction step adds or modifies parts of the molecule, so I need to track the structure after each step.

Step 1: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. Wait, trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring and an alpha, beta-unsaturated structure. The structure is probably something like CH₂=CH–C₆H₄–CHO? No, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. So the structure is benzaldehyde with a propenal group. So it's Ph–CH₂–CHO? No, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually an aromatic aldehyde where the aldehyde is at the end of a propenyl chain. So it's Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, wait, more accurately, it's Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, no, wait. Wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure of cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group attached. So the formula is C₆H₅-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is C₆H₅–CH₂–CHO? No, wait, wait, no. I think I got it wrong. Cinnamaldehyde is C₆H₅–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, that can't be right. Let me get this straight. The correct structure is an aromatic ring (benzene) with a propenal group attached, right? So, the aldehyde is directly attached to the double bond. So it's Ph–CH₂–CH₂–CHO? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's Ph–CH₂–CHO. Wait no, no. Oh! Wait, cinnamaldehyde has the structure C
