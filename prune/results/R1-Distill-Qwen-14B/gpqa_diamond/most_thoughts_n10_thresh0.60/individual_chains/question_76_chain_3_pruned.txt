Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this mouse embryonic chimera question. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my developmental biology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question involves induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from various somatic tissues. These iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry, which is a fluorescent marker. The key here is that mRaspberry is fused under a lineage-specific promoter for each cell type. So, each cell type has a different promoter controlling the expression of the red fluorescent protein, mRaspberry. That probably means that only certain cell lineages will express the red signal, depending on their specific promoter.

The procedure is to inject these dedifferentiated (which I think means pluripotent) cells into a blastocyst at the 32-cell stage. Then, they track the cells over 48 hours. Every 12 hours, they prepare embryos with TUNEL-FITC staining and observe under a confocal microscope.

The question is about what the first thing you'd notice is. The options are A to D. Let's consider each option.

First, I need to recall what TUNEL staining does. TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) is a technique used to detect DNA fragmentation, which is a sign of apoptosis. So, the green signal is from FITC, which is used in TUNEL to mark the DNA breaksâ€”apoptotic cells. So, whenever a cell is undergoing apoptosis, the TUNEL-FITC would bind and show green.

Now, the iPSCs are labeled with mRaspberry under lineage-specific promoters. So, each type of iPSC (like from skin, liver, etc.) would express the red signal only when their specific gene is active. When these iPSCs are injected into the blastocyst, they can potentially integrate into the embryo and differentiate into various cell types, depending on where they migrate and the signals they receive.

When you look at the embryo after 12 hours, or perhaps as early as the first observation, what would happen? Since the cells are injected at the 32-cell stage, the blastocyst is starting to form the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm. The injected iPSCs would be part of the inner cell mass, I think, which will form the embryo proper.

The first thing I might expect is whether the iPSCs are dividing and differentiating. But the question is about the first observation concerning their fate and co-localization with apoptosis.

Wait, when you inject iPSCs into a blastocyst, they can contribute to various tissues. But in the initial stages, cells are probably migrating and perhaps starting to differentiate. However, apoptosis is a normal part of embryonic development. Cells undergo apoptosis during development as part of the sculpting of tissues.

But the question is about the co-localization of the red and green signals. So, when they look under the microscope, they might see whether the red-labeled cells (iPSCs) are also showing green (TUNEL positive, undergoing apoptosis).

So, what's the first thing they notice? Let me think about what happens when iPSCs are injected into a blastocyst. The blastocyst is a structure that has the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm. The ICM includes pluripotent cells that will form the embryo, and the trophectoderm becomes the extraembryonic structures.

Upon injection, the iPSCs should integrate into the ICM and start differentiating into various cell types as the embryo develops. However, during this process, some cells may undergo apoptosis. But would the iPSC-derived cells start apoptosing immediately?

Alternatively, perhaps the early stages involve the iPSCs being in the blastocyst, not yet differentiating. But wait, at the 32-cell stage, the blastocyst is just beginning. So, the first 12 hours might not show much differentiation yet. So maybe the red signals from the iPSCs are present, but where?

Wait, the mRaspberry is under a lineage-specific promoter. So, for each cell type, the red signal would only appear as they start to differentiate into that lineage. So, if the cells are still pluripotent, they might not express the red yet. But wait, the cells are already dedifferentiated into iPSCs, so maybe the promoters are off until they start differentiating again.

So, in the initial stages, perhaps the red signals are not present because the cells are still pluripotent and have not started expressing lineage-specific genes. But this is a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the red signal is visible because the promoters are active in certain tissues. Wait, no, the question says each cell type has its own promoter. So, if the iPSCs are from various tissues, each has a different promoter. But once injected, they can differentiate into various lineages, so only some of them would express red at any
