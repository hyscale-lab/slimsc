Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The parallax in astronomy is usually measured in parsecs, and the formula connecting parallax (π) and distance (d) is d = 1/π. Wait, yeah, so parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

So if d is the distance, then π = 1/d. So parallax is 1/d, which means that as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The given relationship is N ∝ 1/(π)^5. Since π is 1/d, substituting that in, 1/π would be d. So 1/(π)^5 becomes d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but that's for the number of stars at a certain distance d. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. So maybe we're looking at the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dr.

Wait, that makes sense. In other words, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell
