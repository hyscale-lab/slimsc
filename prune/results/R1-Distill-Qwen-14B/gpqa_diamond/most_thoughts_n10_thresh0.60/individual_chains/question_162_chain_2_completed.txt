Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, and I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2, given a specific metric. The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? And in two dimensions, the metric describes the geometry of the space.

Wait, the metric looks a bit like the one for the Poincaré disk model. I think that's a model of hyperbolic space where the metric is given by ds² = [4/(1 - (x² + y²))] (dx² + dy²). Oh wait, but in our case, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). Let me check: 4 is 2 squared, so perhaps this is scaled somehow. So maybe the radius is related to 2 here.

In the Poincaré disk model, the radius of the disk is R, and the curvature is -1/R². Our denominator here is 4 - x² - y², which can be written as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/(4)). So that's (x² + y²) scaled by 4. So the denominator is 4*(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So comparing to the standard Poincaré model denominator (1 - (x² + y²)), it seems that our model is scaled by a factor of 2. Because 4 is 2², so perhaps R is 2 in this case. Because in the standard model, R is the radius of the disk, and the pseudosphere has radius R. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The standard Poincaré metric is ds² = [4/(1 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate. Or in coordinates (x,y), it's the same as the expression given, but with x² + y² = r². So our metric here is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me factor out 4 from denominator: 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So 32 / [4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)] = 8 / (1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 8 * [1/(1 - (x² + y²)/(4))].

Wait, the standard Poincaré metric is 4/(1 - (x² + y²)) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So comparing that to our metric, which is 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/(4)) times (dx² + dy²). So perhaps our metric is just a scaled version.

Let me consider a substitution. Let me set u = x/2 and v = y/2. Then x = 2u and y = 2v. Then dx = 2 du, dy = 2 dv.

Plugging into the metric: ds² = [32/(4 - (4u² +4v²))] (4 du² + 4 dv²)
= [32/(4(1 - u² -v²)))] *4 (du² + dv²)
= [32 *4/(4(1 - u² -v²)))] (du² + dv²)
Wait, wait, let me compute step by step.

Denominator: 4 - x² - y² =4 - (4u² +4v²) =4(1 - u² -v²).

So 32 / denominator is 32/(4(1 - u² -v²)) )= 8/(1 - u² -v²).

Then, dx² + dy² = (2 du)^2 + (2 dv)^2 = 4 du² +4 dv² =4 (du² + dv²).

So putting it all together: ds² = [8/(1 - u² -v²)] * [4 (du² + dv²)] = [32/(1 - u² -v²)] (du² + dv²).

Wait, that brings us back to the same form, but for u and v. Hmm, maybe I'm not seeing it right. Alternatively, perhaps the metric can be rewritten to match the standard Poincaré form.

Wait, the standard Poincaré metric is (4/(1 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). So our metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx^2 + dy^2). Let's factor 4 in denominator: 4 - (x² + y²) =4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So 32/(4 (1 - (x² + y^2)/4 )) )= 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4).

So the metric can be rewritten as 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²) = 8/(1 - (x² + y^2)/4) (dx² + dy^2).

Compare to the standard Poincaré metric, which is 4/(1 - r^2) (dr^2 + ... ). So if our denominator is (1 - r^2/4), then perhaps r is scaled by a factor of 2. Let me set r' = r/2, where r is the radial coordinate in the standard model. Then, the denominator becomes (1 - (r')²). Because r = 2 r', so r² =4 r'^2. So 1 - (r'^2) =1 - (r²/4). Exactly.

So if I let u = x/2, v = y/2, then the metric becomes [8/(1 - u² -v²)] (du^2 + dv^2). Because x = 2u, y=2v, so x² + y² =4u² +4v²=4 (u² +v^2). So denominator is 4 - 4(u² +v^2)=4(1 - (u^2 +v^2)). So 32/(4(1 - (u^2 +v^2)) )= 8/(1 - u² -v²). So the ds^2 is 8/(1 - u² -v²) (du² + dv²). Wait, but the standard Poincaré metric is 4/(1 - u² -v^2) (du² + dv²). So in our case, it's 8 times that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the scaling is different. Because in the standard model, the curvature is -1, but in our case, perhaps the curvature is different.

Wait, the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, the area of a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, like a pseudosphere, is infinite. Because as you go to larger radii, the area keeps increasing. But wait, the Poincaré disk model has finite area within the disk, but the actual hyperbolic plane is of infinite extent and thus infinite area.

Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, wait, a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, so it's like a sphere but with negative curvature. The area would be 4π r², but wait, for a sphere in Euclidean space. But for a pseudosphere, which is a model of hyperbolic space, the area is different. Oh wait, maybe the area is computed using the metric given.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a hyperbolic space, and the question is about the area of the entire space, which is infinite.

Wait, but the options are A) 0, B) 4π(x² + y²), C) 4π(x² - y²), D) +infty. So our options are either zero, some multiple of (x² + y²), which would be position-dependent, or infinity.

Wait, but the area of the entire pseudosphere (which is the hyperbolic plane) would be infinite, so option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of a specific surface at a certain radius. Let me think. The pseudosphere in the Poincaré model is represented within a disk of radius R=2, since in our case, the denominator is 4 -x² - y², which implies that x² + y² <4; so the model is defined within a disk of radius 2. But the actual hyperbolic plane extends infinitely, so the area is infinite.

So the area of the pseudosphere would be infinite. So the answer is D.

Wait, but what about the area of a finite surface? No, the question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, perhaps the pseudosphere being referred to is a two-dimensional surface, like a sphere with radius 2. But in Euclidean space, a sphere's area is 4π r², which would be 16π here. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of the entire space, which is the hyperbolic plane with curvature, which is indeed infinite.

So the answer should be D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This metric resembles the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic geometry, where the standard metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{4}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

By factoring out 4 from the denominator in the given metric, it can be rewritten as:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{8}{1 - (x^2 + y^2)/4} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

This shows that the metric is a scaled version of the Poincaré disk model, with the disk radius effectively being \( R = 2 \). In the Poincaré disk model, the hyperbolic plane is represented within a disk of radius \( R \), but the actual hyperbolic plane extends infinitely. The area of the entire hyperbolic plane is therefore infinite.

The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface with constant negative curvature, corresponding to the hyperbolic plane. Since the hyperbolic plane is infinite in extent, its total area is infinite.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area of a pseudosphere is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area is not position-dependent in this context.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as the area is not position-dependent in this context.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the hyperbolic plane has infinite area.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

Answer: D
