Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, meaning it's not necessarily a unit vector yet.

The second part of the question is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does this matrix look like? Let's think about a 2x2 matrix since we're dealing with spin-up and spin-down states.

Wait, if the operator A has elements A_ij such that it's hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise, then the matrix would look like this:

[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2   0]

So, it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. That sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices usually have 1s off the diagonal, so scaling that would give this structure.

But wait, the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of the Pauli X are the |+> and |-> states, which are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction. So, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the question is, when we express |alpha> in terms of these x-eigenstates, the probabilities of measuring each will be the square of the coefficients of those states.

But first, let me get |alpha> normalized. The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is (1+i)(1 - i) + (2 - i)(2 + i). Wait, no, more accurately, it's |a|^2 + |b|^2 where a=(1+i), b=(2-i). So |a|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1=2.

Similarly, |b|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized state is |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, I need to express this state in terms of the x-eigenstates. Let me write the x-eigenstates as:

|x+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|x-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, any state can be expressed as a linear combination of |x+> and |x->. Let's write |alpha> as a combination of these.

Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |x+> + c_- |x->.

To find c_+ and c_-, I can take the inner product of |alpha> with |x+> and |x->.

Alternatively, solve the system. Let's substitute |x+> and |x-> into the expression.

So,

c_+ = <x+ | alpha> 
= [(1/sqrt(2)) <up| + (1/sqrt(2)) <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Factor out 1/(sqrt(7)*sqrt(2)):

= [ (1+i + 2 -i) ] / (sqrt(14)) 

Simplify numerator: 1 +2 =3, i -i=0. So 3/sqrt(14) = 3 / (sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- is <x- | alpha>:

= [ (1/sqrt(2)) <up| - (1/sqrt(2)) <down| ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (1+i -2 +i) ] / (sqrt(14))

Simplify numerator: (1-2) = -1; i + i = 2i. So (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Thus, c_+ = 3/(sqrt(14)), and c_- = (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3^2)/(14) =9/14 ≈ 0.642857...
Wait, but looking at the options, the first probabilities are 0.64, 0.54, 0.28, etc. So 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is approximately 0.64, so that would match option A or D.

But let's compute |c_-|^2. 

c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14)
So |c_-|^2 = [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.35714. Hmm, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the first two numbers in the options are 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A (0.64, 0.36, ...) and perhaps other options have different third parts.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes, when you have a state expressed in eigenstates, the probabilities sum to 1. So 9/14 +5/14 =14/14=1, so that's correct.

Now, the next part is finding the average value of the operator A. The operator A is represented by the matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal. So, the average value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, and since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but perhaps for the average, I can compute it directly.

But perhaps it's easier to compute it the standard way. Let's compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

The state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

So, let me write |alpha> as a column vector in the basis |up> and |down>.

In matrix form, |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is a 2x2 matrix:

[0   hbar/2
hbar/2   0 ]

So, compute A|alpha>:

A|alpha> = [ (hbar/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (hbar/2)*(1 + i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> is the conjugate transpose of |alpha> multiplied by A|alpha>.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha| A |alpha> as the sum of the components.

Another approach: since A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, the average value is sum_{i,j} A_ij * <e_i| alpha> * <alpha |e_j>, where e_i are the basis states.

Wait, let me think. <A> is sum_{i,j} A_ij [ <e_i | alpha> ] [ < alpha | e_j> ]

But since A_ij is zero when i =j, we only have terms where i≠j. So,

<A> = A_12 <e_1| alpha> <alpha |e_2> + A_21 <e_2| alpha> <alpha |e_1>

But A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2.

So,

<A> = (hbar/2) [ <e_1| alpha> <alpha|e_2> + <e_2| alpha> <alpha|e_1> ]

But <e_1 | alpha> is the component of |alpha> in the e_1 direction, which is (1+i)/sqrt(7), and <e_2| alpha> is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, substituting:

= (hbar/2) [ ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )*( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )^* + ( (2 -i)/sqrt(7) )*( (1+i)/sqrt(7) )^* )

Wait, let me compute each part. First, (1+i)/sqrt(7) is a, and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) is b.

So, a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b= (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Compute a * b^* + b * a^*.

Wait, a * b^* is (1+i)(2 +i)/7, since b^* is (2 -i)^* = (2 +i).

Similarly, b * a^* is (2 -i)(1 -i)/7.

Compute each term:

(1+i)(2+i) = 1*2 +1*i +i*2 +i*i = 2 +i +2i +i² = 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

(2 -i)(1 -i) = 2*1 +2*(-i) -i*1 +i*i = 2 -2i -i +i² = 2 -3i -1 =1 -3i.

So,

a*b^* + b*a^* = (1+3i +1 -3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So,

<A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A has average value hbar/7, and the probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. So the first part of the answer would be probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7. Which is option A.

Wait, but wait a second. When I calculated |c_+|^2, I thought it was 9/14 which is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. And |c_-|^2 is 5/14 ≈0.3571. But the options give 0.64 and 0.36, which seems to match.

So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571, which would round to 0.64 and 0.36. So option A is 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the operator's eigenstates are not the x-direction ones because A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Let me think again.

Yes, A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. The expectation value of sigma_x is <sigma_x> = [ (a b^* + a^* b) ] / ( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ), but wait, no. Let me think.

Alternatively, the expectation value of A is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x in the state |alpha>.

The expectation value of sigma_x is (a * b^* + a^* * b) because sigma_x = [[0 1],[1 0]]. So when you compute <sigma_x>, it's (a * conj(b) + conj(a)*b) all over |a|^2 + |b|^2? Wait, no, because |alpha> is already normalized, so |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

Wait, earlier I found that a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, <sigma_x> = (a * b^* ) + (a^* * b) 

We computed a*b^* + a^*b as 2/7.

So, <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7. Which matches the earlier calculation.

So, putting it all together, the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is: 0.64, 0.36, hbar/7. So that's the correct option.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to normalize the state, calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \) (with matrix representation \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise), and find the average value of \( A \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state is \( |\alpha\rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the squared norm:
\[
\| |\alpha\rangle \|^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, and its eigenstates are:
\[
|x_+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad
|x_-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |x_+\rangle \) and \( |x_-\rangle \)
To find the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) in \( |\alpha\rangle = c_+ |x_+\rangle + c_- |x_-\rangle \), compute the inner products:
\[
c_+ = \langle x_+ | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
c_- = \langle x_- | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities
The probabilities of measuring the particle in \( |x_+\rangle \) and \( |x_-\rangle \) are \( |c_+|^2 \) and \( |c_-|^2 \), respectively:
\[
|c_+|^2 = \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad
|c_-|^2 = \left( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( A \), compute:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \cdot \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} + \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \cdot \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right).
\]
Simplify:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.
