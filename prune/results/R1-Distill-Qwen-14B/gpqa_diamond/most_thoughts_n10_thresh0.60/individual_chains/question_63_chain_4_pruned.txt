Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states after absorbing a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, or the non-rigid rotor model. So, I remember that for diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational states are quantized. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means the lowest vibrational state, right? The ground state for vibration.

Wait, wait. The fundamental state is usually the lowest energy state for vibration, which is the first vibrational level, n=0. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy. That probably means it transitions to the next vibrational level, n=1, because that's the lowest energy jump. Or maybe it's about the next higher rotational stateâ€”no, wait, the question says "next state with the lowest possible energy," so probably the first available higher state, which would be vibration. Or does it involve both rotational and vibrational changes?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The question is about the momentum of the photon. Photons carry energy, and their energy is related to their frequency. The energy of a photon is E = hf = pc, where h is Planck's constant, f is frequency, and p is momentum.

So, the molecule must absorb a photon with just enough energy to move to the next state. But what's the energy difference between the states? Since the model being used is the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels account for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the fundamental state could mean the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). Or is the fundamental state the same as the ground state, which includes both the lowest vibrational and rotational levels? Hmm.

Wait, the question says "to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next possible state would probably be the next vibrational state, n=1, while keeping the rotational state at J=0. Or maybe it's the next higher state overall, which could involve increasing J or n. But in the case of the molecule being in the ground state, the next state would likely be the next vibrational state, since vibrational energy levels have higher spacing than rotational ones. But wait, not necessarily. It depends on the energy differences between levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition where the molecule increases its
