Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's break it down.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the fundamental state... Oh right, that's the state with the lowest possible energy. So if it absorbs a photon, it'll move to the next higher energy state. But wait, the next state with the lowest possible energyâ€”does that mean it's the next state in the energy spectrum? Or maybe it's a transition within the same rotational level but a higher vibrational state? Or perhaps a change in both rotation and vibration?

Wait, no. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think refers to the ground state. So the ground state would be the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state. So the next state would probably be the first excited state, but which part of the spectrum changes? Probably, the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state.

Wait, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's the smallest possible energy increase. So perhaps a transition within the same rotational level but to the next vibrational level, or a change in the rotational state without changing vibration. Or maybe a
