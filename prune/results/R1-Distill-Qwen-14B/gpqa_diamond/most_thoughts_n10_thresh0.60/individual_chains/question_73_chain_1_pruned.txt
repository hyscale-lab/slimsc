Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me see. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, first, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical velocity addition. Oh right, we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, what's that formula again? I think it's something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), but wait, wait. Wait, no, that's for when the velocities are in the same direction. Let me think again. If both objects are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u and v are their speeds relative to the same frame. Oh right, so the relative speed is how fast one is moving with respect to the other.

So in this problem, both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut A has mass 2m and speed 0.6c, and astronaut B has mass 3m and speed 0.5c. Wait, but wait, the problem says they're moving at these speeds, so their velocities are u = 0.6c and v = 0.5c. So the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].
