Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, the problem says the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, the first thing I need to do is find the relative speed between them. Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds because you can't just add or subtract velocities like you would in Newtonian mechanics when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light.

I remember that the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, wait, wait. Let me get this right. If object A is moving at speed u relative to an inertial frame, and object B is moving at speed v relative to the same frame, then the speed of A relative to B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Right, that sounds familiar.

So in this case, both are moving in the same direction. Let's say the first astronaut (A) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (B) at 0.5c. So from B's frame, what is A's speed? Or wait, no, the relative speed is the speed of one as seen from the other. So if A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, then in B's frame, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, let's compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²), which is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c
