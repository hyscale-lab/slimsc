Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to work through it step by step.

So the reaction scheme starts with compound A, which reacts with HCN to form compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. C reacts with HNO2 to make D, and then D loses an inert gas to form E. The options are all cyclic ketones, so E must be a ketone.

Looking at the hints: hint a says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So A must have a carbonyl group since the Wittig reaction forms alkenes from aldehydes or ketones.

The structure given in hint a is a cyclopentane ring. The substituents are 1,2-dimethyl and 4-(propan-2-ylidene). Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a CH2C(CH3)2 group, right? Because the ylide would have a double bond. So the Wittig reaction would add a CH2CH(CH3)2 group or something similar. Wait, maybe I should draw this out.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. And at position 4, there's a propylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)2? Or is it a CH2-CH(CH3)2? Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Propan-2-ylidene would be the structure where the substituent is on the second carbon. So the ylide would be something like P=CH-CH(CH3)2? Or maybe it's more like CH2-C(CH3)2= where the double bond is between the central carbon and the adjacent one.

Wait, maybe the ylide is like CH2=C(CH3)2-PPh3+ or something. So the Wittig reaction would take a carbonyl group (from compound A) and replace it
