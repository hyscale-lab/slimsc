Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about how the number of stars changes with distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted as 'p' sometimes. So the formula is Number of stars ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Got it.

I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, parallax p is equal to 1 over distance d, but I'm not 100% sure about the exact formula. Oh wait, no, more precisely, the distance in parsecs is 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d (in parsecs) = 1/p. So p = 1/d. That's right.

So the number of stars varies as 1/p^5, which is the same as d^5 because p is 1/d. Let me write that out. Number of stars N ∝ 1/p^5. Substitute p = 1/d: N ∝ d^5. Oh wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, but the question is about the change in the number of stars with distance. I think I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and the distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then the number increases as distance increases. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, so maybe it's about
