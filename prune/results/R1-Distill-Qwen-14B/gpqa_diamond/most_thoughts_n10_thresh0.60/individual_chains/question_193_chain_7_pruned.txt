Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax plx is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if d increases, plx decreases.

Let me write down the given relationship. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ (d)^5. Wait, wait, because plx = 1/d → 1/plx = d. So 1/(plx)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so they're looking for the differential change, like dN/dr. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) would be 5*d^4. But wait, the options don't have d^4. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. Because N is proportional to d^5. Let me model this more accurately. Let's say N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. Then, if we consider the change in N with distance, per unit distance, it's dN
