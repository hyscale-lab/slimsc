Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Hmm, I remember that wave functions need to satisfy certain conditions, like normalization, because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a minute—particles' wave functions usually are complex, but the part that contributes to the probability is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Oh wait, but in this case, the wave function has a real part and an imaginary part. So when calculating the probability density, I have to find the modulus squared of the wave function.

Wait, but the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So let me write that as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - (0.5)i. So the complex conjugate would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + (0.5)i. Then the modulus squared is ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because when you multiply the terms, the cross terms (like a/sqrt(1+x) * 0.5i and its conjugate) would add up as imaginary parts which cancel out. Wait, no, let me actually compute it properly.

Wait,
