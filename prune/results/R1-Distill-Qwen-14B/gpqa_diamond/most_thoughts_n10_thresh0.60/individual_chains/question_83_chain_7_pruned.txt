Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We're diluting 20.00 cm³ (which is 20.00 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The choices are A, B, C, D with different pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you get a buffer solution before the equivalence point, and then a solution of the conjugate base after that.

Wait, but first, let's think about the dilution. The initial solution is 20 mL of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 mL of water, so the total volume becomes 40 mL. So the concentration will change because of dilution.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL, V2 is 40 mL. So M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = (1)/40 = 0.0125 M. Oh wait, no, wait: 0.05 * 20 is 1 mmol, and divided by 40 mL gives 0.025 M? Wait, let me recalculate. Oh yeah, 20 mL times 0.05 M is 1 mmol. Then adding another 20 mL makes 40 mL, so concentration is 1 mmol / 40 mL = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let me think about the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid present.

Moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 mL is 0.04 L) = 0.001 moles. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL.

So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added. The question is about 25% titration, which would be 25% of 10 mL, which is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the 25% titration refers to the percentage of the acetic acid that
