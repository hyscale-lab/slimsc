Okay, I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. So, the question is about an atomic nucleus that undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy and the classical approximation.

Wait, the problem gives me some numbers. The initial nucleus has a rest mass energy of 300 GeV. Oh wait, that's because E=mc², right? So the rest energy is given as 300 GeV. 

When it fissions, the two fragments have a combined rest mass of 99% of M. That's 0.99*M. So the initial mass was M, and after fission, the rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99*M. That means energy was released, right? Because mass turned into energy. So the total energy after fission is more than the rest energy before if we include kinetic energy.

The problem says the fragments are such that one is twice as massive as the other. So let me denote the rest masses. Let me call the smaller mass m. Then the larger is 2m. So, m + 2m = 0.99*M. So 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait. The initial nucleus was at rest, so total momentum before was zero. So after fission, the two fragments must move
