Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and going through several steps, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. The options are A to D, with numbers 6, 8, 10, or 7.

First, I need to break down each step and see what reactions are happening. Let's take each reaction one by one.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. So, the first step is treating it with bromine to form product 1. Oh wait, bromine can add to carbonyl groups. But wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group, so bromine might undergo some kind of addition or maybe substitution. Alternatively, I think of the possibility of a cyclohexanone brominating under certain conditions. Wait, no, more likely, since it's a ketone, it's about the addition of bromine. Oh, right, the bromine might add to the carbonyl group, but wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so the reaction could be a cycloaddition? Or maybe it's an enolate formation. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's an example of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for carboxylic acids. Or maybe it's a bromination via some enol intermediate. Oh wait! Another possibility: the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. So, cyclohexanone (which is (CH2)5CO) reacting with Br2. I think that when a ketone reacts with bromine, it can undergo an addition reaction. So for ketones, bromine adds to the carbonyl group, leading to the formation of a dibromide.

Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Adding bromine would add across the carbonyl, so the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Wait, no, not exactly. Let me think: when a ketone reacts with bromine, it's a 1,2-addition, so the carbonyl becomes a Br-C-OBr structure? Or perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation? No, that's when you have water. Wait, maybe it's a di
