Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like it's in two dimensions, right? Because there are dx and dy terms. So the line element is in terms of x and y, but this is probably in some curved space since the coefficient is a function of x and y.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, in general relativity, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. I remember that the metric for a pseudosphere in 2D is usually written in terms of Poincaré coordinates or something like that, and it's something like ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - k r²), where k is the curvature. But wait, this question's metric doesn't look exactly like that. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the given metric is conformally flat, which means it's written as a product of a function and the flat metric (dx² + dy²). So the conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Wait, but I'm not sure how that relates to the pseudosphere.

Wait, the metric for a pseudosphere (which is a surface of negative curvature) in Poincaré coordinates would have a
