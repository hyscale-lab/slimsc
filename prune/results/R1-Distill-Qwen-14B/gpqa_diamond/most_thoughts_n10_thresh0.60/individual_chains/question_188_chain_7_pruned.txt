Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Oh wait, a rhombohedral crystal is a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, and all the face angles are the same. So that's a bit like a cube but with rhombic faces, right?

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, so in a crystal, that's the lattice parameter. Oh right, in a cubic system, the lattice parameter 'a' is the edge length. But in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, but the angles between them are all the same, given as alpha, beta, gamma. In this case, all angles are 30 degrees.

The problem asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. For that, I remember there's a formula involving the Miller indices and the lattice parameters.

Wait, the formula for interplanar distance 'd' is given by 1/d^2 = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) multiplied by some factor depending on the structure. But wait, I think for a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but rhombohedral is a bit more complicated because of
