Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question says that the compound is synthesized because of a gene with five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations, usually by adding a methyl group to DNA, leading to base changes. 

The intact gene has a certain sequence, and the mutants have changes in the first exon area. Since exons are the coding regions, any mutation here could potentially change the protein product.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing the first few bases. Let's see:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT...
So, the third codon in the intact is TTT (which is Phe), and in mutant1, it's TTC (still Phe, since TTC is also Phe). But the next codon in intact is CTC, which is Leu. In mutant1, it's TAC, which is Tyr. So, that would change the amino acid from Leu to Tyr. Wait, but maybe I'm looking at this wrong. Maybe the change is in the first exon's beginning.

Wait, the problem says the changes are at the beginning of the sequence, so perhaps in the first few codons.

Looking at the first few codons:

Intact:
ATG (start) TTT (Phe) CTC (Leu) GCT (Ala) GGT (Gly) ACT (Thr) ...

Mutant1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT... Wait, no. Let me look again.

Wait, the intact sequence is: ATG TTT CT CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGG...

Wait, perhaps it's easier to line them up.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant1:
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

So, in the first codon, ATG remains the same (start).

Second codon: TTT (Phe) in intact, TTC (Phe) in mutant1. So no change.

Third codon: CTC (Leu) in intact, TAC (Tyr) in mutant1.

So, the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr at position 3.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, let's compare.

Intact third codon is CTC (Leu), mutant2 has TAA (Stop). Wait, because the third codon in the mutant is TAA.

Wait, the second codon in intact is TTT, in mutant2 it's TTC (so same as before, Phe). Third codon: CTC becomes GCT? Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, the intact sequence is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. Wait, that can't be right. Because in the middle of the gene, a stop codon would terminate translation early. So the protein would be shorter. If the anti-nutritional compound is being made, perhaps a premature stop codon would make a non-functional enzyme, so the compound might not be produced. But wait, if the enzyme is non-functional, maybe the compound
