Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and the length of its orbital period.

Alright, the problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both orbits are circular. So the main differences here must be in the Doppler shifts observed.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance between them. Oh, right, the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) )? No, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, the formula I think is K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )? Wait, no, perhaps I should look for a better approach.

Wait, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Let me think: the formula relates K, the velocity, to the star's motion. The formula is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 AU)^1 ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e^2)) )) ), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that term goes away. And since the planet masses are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass (Sun-like stars), M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ ( G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something). Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law says that P^2 = (4π²/G(M)) a^3, where a is the semi-major axis. So a^3 = G(M) P^2 / (4π²). But in radial velocity, the velocity K is related to the star's movement, which is 2π a (star's orbit) / P. Since a (star) = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * a_planet. And since M_p << M_star, a ≈ (M_p / M_star) * a_planet.

Wait, but wait, the star's velocity K is given
