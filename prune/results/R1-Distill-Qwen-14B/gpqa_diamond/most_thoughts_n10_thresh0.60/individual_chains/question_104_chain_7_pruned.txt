Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull making the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune, so their masses are roughly the same. Both planets are in circular orbits, so eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation between these shifts and the orbital period. Let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the shift. K is given by (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/ something?), or maybe another formula. Alternatively, the formula I remember is K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * (1 day)^-1 )) ) )^(1/ something? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ). Because when M_p is much smaller than M_star, which it is for planets around stars, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so the denominator doesn't have that 1-sqrt term.

So, K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) ) ) * something else... Wait, maybe the
