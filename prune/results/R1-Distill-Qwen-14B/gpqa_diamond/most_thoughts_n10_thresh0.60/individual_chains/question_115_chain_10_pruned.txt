Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's start by breaking down the question and figuring out what's going on.

So, the setup: there's an electron and a positron moving towards each other along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron is moving from the right. Their Lorentz factors are given as 4 and 2, respectively. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured such that one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right direction. The question is asking for the angle between these two photons.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, typically in the form of photons. Since both particles are moving along the same line, their collision is head-on, and the resulting photons must carry off the energy and momentum in a way that conserves both.

Wait a second, in annihilation, the total energy and momentum before the collision must equal those after. Since photons are massless and carry momentum, their directions and energies must balance this.

But wait, the electron and positron have equal masses but opposite charges. Their rest mass is the same, so when they annihilate, the energy should be significant. So, the center-of-momentum frame might be important here.

Wait, the problem states that both photons have the same energy. Hmm, that's interesting because if they have the same energy, their momenta should be equal in
