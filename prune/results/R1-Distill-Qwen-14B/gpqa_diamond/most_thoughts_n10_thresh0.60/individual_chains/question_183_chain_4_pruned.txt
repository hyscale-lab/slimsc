Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product. Hmm, I need to think this through. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh boy, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, right?). Also, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3. So, the ring has substituents at 2 and 5, and the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 maybe?

Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would mean the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring is like:

1   2
 \ /
  3=C-4
  /   \
5      6

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to draw it mentally. So, the ring is cyclohexene, with substituents on carbon 2 (formyl) and carbon 5 (vinyl). So, the structure is:

Carbon 1 connected to Carbon 2, which has the formyl group. Carbon 2 is adjacent to Carbon 3, which is double-bonded to Carbon 4. Carbon 5 has the vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So, carbon 5 is attached to a CH2-CH2 group? Or CH2=CH-?

Wait, the substituent is 5-vinyl, which is CH2=CH- attached to carbon 5. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a formyl group at C2 and a vinyl group at C5, and a double bond from C3 to C4.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, when alkenes are treated with red phosphorus and HI, it's a way to break alkenes. Alternatively
