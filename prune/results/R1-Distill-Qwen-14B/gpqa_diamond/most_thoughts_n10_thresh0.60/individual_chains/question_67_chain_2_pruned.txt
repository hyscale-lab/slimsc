Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, so I don't have to worry about that part. The state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. Each is 1, which makes sense for a p orbital since p has l=1.

The total angular momentum quantum number is l=2, and m is -1. So the combined state is a two-electron system with these quantum numbers.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. We need to find the probability that both measurements give -ħ.

Wait, orbital angular momentum for each electron is given by L² |ψ> = ħ² l(l+1) |ψ>, and L_z |ψ> = ħ m l |ψ>, right? So for each electron, L_z can have eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or ħ since l=1.

But the state is a coupled angular momentum state. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total orbital angular momentum is l=2 and m=-1. How does this relate to the individual electrons' states?

I remember that when combining angular momenta, the states can be expressed as a combination of states where each individual angular momentum is in a particular state. For two electrons, each with l=1, the total l can be 2, 1, or 0. But in this case, the total l is 2.

Wait, but the combined state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So the total orbital angular momentum is l=2, and m=-1.

But to find the probabilities, I think I need to express this state in terms of the product states of individual electron states. Each electron has their own l₁z and l₂z. So for each electron, their m could be -1, 0, or +1. But since the combined state is |1,1,2,-1>, the total m is the sum of m₁ and m₂. Here, m is -1, so m₁ + m₂ = -1.

But the problem is asking for the probability that both L₁z and L₂z are -ħ. That would mean m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1, right? Because L_z |m> = ħ m |m>, so each m corresponds to a multiple of ħ.

Wait, but wait a second. Each electron's orbital angular momentum is l=1, so the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So for each electron, L_z can be -ħ, 0, or ħ, but we're looking for both being -ħ, so m₁=-1 and m₂=-1.

So the question is: what's the probability that when we measure L₁z and L₂z, both are -ħ. That is, the probability that m₁ = -1 and m₂ = -1.

How do I find that? Well, I think we need to expand the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m₁, m₂>. The state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total m is -1, which is m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So possible combinations of m₁ and m₂ that add up to -1 are:

m₁ = -1, m₂ = 0.

m₁ = 0, m₂ = -1.

m₁ = 1, m₂ =-2 → but wait, m cannot be -2 because each particle has l=1, so m cannot be less than -1.

Wait, so the possible (m₁, m₂) pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1), and perhaps (1,-2) is invalid. So only
