Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than pure.

Wait, what's the structure of a qubit's density matrix? A single qubit is a 2x2 matrix. For a pure state, say |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, the density matrix is just that outer product. But when it's a mixed state, you have a convex combination of projectors. Oh right, this ρ looks like it's a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with equal probability.

Let me write it out. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ correspond to the vectors [1; 0] and [0; 1], respectively. The projectors |0><0| and |1><1| are the diagonal matrices diag(1,0) and diag(0,1). So adding them gives diag(1,1), and multiplying by 1/2 gives diag(1/2, 1/2).

Oh wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in (1,1), 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (2,2). So adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element is 1/2. So the density matrix is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]].

I remember that for a qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a vector in a 3-dimensional space using the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and the density matrix is expressed in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. 

If I expand that, ρ = (I/2) + (x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. Since I is the identity matrix, I/2 is diag(1/2, 1/2). So when I have ρ as diag(1/2, 1/2), that means all the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are the same.

Looking at the general form, the diagonal elements of ρ are (1 + z)/2 and (1 - z)/2. Wait, no, let me think again. The diagonal elements of I/2 are 1/2 and 1/2. The σ_z matrix is diag(1, -1), so (σ_z)/2 is diag(1/2, -1/2). So when you add I/2 and (x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2, the diagonal becomes 1/2 + z/2
