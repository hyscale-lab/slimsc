Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy and redshifts. Hmm, let me think. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. It's in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. So when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs it at this wavelength.

Redshift (z) comes into play here because the observed wavelength is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength. Oh right, so the emitted wavelength here is 1216 Angstroms, the Lyman alpha.

But wait, the cloud is at some redshift z. The quasar's light, when it reaches us, has its Lyman alpha absorption at a longer wavelength than 1216. So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit * (1 + z). So lambda_obs = 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

But optical telescopes can only see certain wavelengths. Wait, optical range is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So the observed Lyman alpha must be within this range for ground-based optical telescopes to detect it.

So
