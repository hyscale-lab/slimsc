Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stumped, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem starts with Compound A, which has an NMR spectrum with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, it undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce Compound D. We have to identify D from the options given.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what Compound A is based on its NMR.

Compound A's NMR: A triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm. That's usually indicative of a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests another set of CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to a CH group. Wait, so maybe it's something like two CH2CH3 groups? Let's think.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H – that's two sets of three H each. Because in a triplet, each H is split into two by neighboring Hs. Wait, no, the integration is 6, which suggests maybe two equivalent methyl groups. So maybe it's a di-substituted structure, like (CH2CH3)2CH2? Or perhaps a cyclopropane derivative? Hmm, maybe I should consider more possibilities.

Wait, another possibility: the triplet could be two sets of adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, no, the triplet is for 6H, which is two methyl groups (each CH3 has 3 H, so two would give 6). So the triplet suggests that each CH3 is next to a CH2. So perhaps a structure where two CH2 groups are attached to a central CH, like CH2CH2CH3—no, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's something like (CH2CH3)2CH2. Wait, no, that would have more Hs. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane with two methyl groups attached. But cyclopropane's Hs usually appear around 1.0-1.5 ppm, but maybe the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, another thought: the triplet for 6H (each H in the triplet) would come from each CH3 group being adjacent to a CH2. So maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2. Wait, no, that would have (CH2CH3)2CH2, but that would be a butane derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to something. Like, for example, maybe ethyl groups on adjacent carbons. Wait, but that might complicate the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopropane ring with two methyl substituents. So, cyclopropane has three carbons. If two of them are each attached to a methyl group, the structure would be something like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but
