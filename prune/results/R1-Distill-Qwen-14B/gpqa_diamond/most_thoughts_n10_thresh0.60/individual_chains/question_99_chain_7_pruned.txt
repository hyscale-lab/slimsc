Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data provided. Let me go through this step by step.

First, let me look at the given information. The compound was analyzed using FTIR and 1H NMR. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. The NMR has several signals, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no double bonds or something like that. Also, in the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated.

Starting with the IR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is more likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So, what compounds have both O-H and C=O? Maybe a carboxylic acid because they have both groups. So the compound is probably a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, all the structures end with a COOH group. So that's consistent. So we can focus on the rest of the structure.

The NMR part: no vinyl hydrogens means no double bonds, so the structure is entirely single bonds, which makes sense because all the options are substituted carboxylic acids without double bonds. 

Now, the splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That seems complex. Let me think about how NMR splitting works. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons splits the signal into a number of peaks equal to n+1, where n is the number of neighboring Hs.

Wait, a doublet of triplets of quartets would mean the proton is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. Each coupling would split the signal further. Let me break it down. Let's say a proton has neighbors with m, n, and p protons. The splitting would be (m+1)(n+1)(p+1) peaks? Or each coupling adds a level of splitting.

Wait, no, each coupling is a separate splitting. So if a proton is next to two different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants (but for simplicity, assuming same J), it would first split into a triplet (from one neighbor), and then each of those splits into a triplet again (from the second neighbor), resulting in a triplet of triplets, which is 3x3=9 peaks. But wait, in the question, it's a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, maybe that's more than two couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from being adjacent to multiple non-equivalent protons. Let me think about the structures of the options.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Structure-wise, that
