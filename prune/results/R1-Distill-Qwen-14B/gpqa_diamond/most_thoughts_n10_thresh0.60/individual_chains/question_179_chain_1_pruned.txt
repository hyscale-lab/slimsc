Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices are really important, especially for things like operators and states. Let me try to break down each part step by step.

The question gives four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And there are four options, A to D, each making a statement about these matrices. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

Let me first recall some concepts. In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices. The evolution operator, which is the time evolution operator, is unitary. Also, the exponential of a matrix is involved in things like time evolution, especially when dealing with the Schrödinger equation.

So, looking at the options:

Option A says there exists a vector where multiplying by e^X changes the norm. Wait, the norm is the length of the vector. For the norm to stay the same after multiplying by a matrix, that matrix must be unitary. Because if U is unitary, then U†U = I, so ||Uv|| = ||v|| for any vector v. So if e^X is not unitary, then there exists a vector where the norm changes. Alternatively, if e^X is not unitary, then there is such a vector. So I need to check if e^X is unitary.

But wait, what's X? X is given as a 3x3 matrix with complex entries. To compute if e^X is unitary, I might need to look at X's properties. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary. So if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X is unitary. But is X skew-Hermitian?

Skew-Hermitian means X† = -X. Let me compute X†. X is:

i   -1   2i
1    0    1
2i  -1   -i

Transposing this (switching rows and columns) gives:

i   1    2i
-1   0   -1
2i   1   -i

Then taking the complex conjugate of each element:

-i   -1   -2i
1    0    1
-2i  -1    i

So X† is:

Row 1: [-i, -1, -2i]
Row 2: [1, 0, 1]
Row 3: [-2i, -1, i]

Now, let's see if this equals -X. Let's compute -X:

-X is:

- i   1   -2i
-1    0   -1
-2i   1    i

Comparing X† and -X:

X† row 1: [-i, -1, -2i]
-X row 1: [-i, 1, -2i]. Wait, wait, no. Wait, -X's row 1 is -i, 1, -2i? Let me recheck. X is
