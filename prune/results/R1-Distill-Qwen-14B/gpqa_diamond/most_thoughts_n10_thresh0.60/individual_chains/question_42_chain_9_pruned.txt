Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just context.

The question gives me two ratios of equilibrium temperatures. The first is between Planet1 and Planet2, which is approximately 1.4. The second is between Planet2 and Planet3, and that's about 2.3. So, Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by 1.4 times, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by 2.3 times.

Then, the mass ratios are given. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So, Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2, and Planet2 is a bit more massive than Planet3. 

The question is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Specifically, by what factor is Planet3's period larger than Planet1's. And all three have the same albedo of 0.3, which is Earth-like. 

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula, I think, is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) / (1 + e) )^(1/2), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. So the formula simplifies. Wait, actually, the equilibrium temperature formula might be T = T_eff * ( (L / (16πσ a² (1 - A) )) )^(1/4), but maybe it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law for flux and then apply the fourth root for temperature.

Wait, another approach: the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (1 - A) / (D^2) )^(1/4), where D is the distance from the star. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, and equilibrium temperature depends on the fourth root of flux (since flux is sigma T^4 times some constants). So if two planets have the same star, their temperatures ratio would be ( (1 - A2)/(1 - A1) )^(1/4) * (D1/D2) )^(1/2).

Wait, but the problem states that all three have the same albedo, A=0.3. So (1 - A) is the same for all. So the temperature ratio between two planets should be sqrt( (D_planet2 / D_planet1) )^(-1/2). No, wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - A) / (4 (1 + e)) )^(1/4) * ( L / (4πσ) )^(1/4) * (1/(2a))^(1/2) ) Wait, maybe I'm
