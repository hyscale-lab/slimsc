Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these mechanisms.

The question has two parts: Reaction 1 and Reaction 2, each with their own reagents and conditions. I need to determine the major products A and B for each and match them to the options provided.

Starting with Reaction 1:
The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reagents are THF, KH, and H+. Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, often used in Grignard reactions. KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base, maybe used to deprotonate something. Then H+ is added, probably as a proton source.

Wait, spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, right? So 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would have a spiro structure where the two rings are a 5-membered and a 3-membered? Or wait, wait, no. Spiro[3.5]non- means that the main chain is nine carbons, with two rings. The first ring is three carbons (like a cyclopropane), and the second is five (like cyclopentane?), connected at the 1-position. But wait, the formula is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group attached at position 1. So structure-wise, it's like a cyclopropane fused to a cyclopentane via a single carbon, and that carbon has a vinyl group.

The reaction conditions: THF, KH, then H+. So under basic conditions, maybe the alcohol (OH) is deprotonated. Then, when H+ is added, what happens? Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could this be an elimination reaction? Or perhaps a ring-opening?

Alternatively, when alcohols are treated with a strong base like KH (which is a source of H-), it can deprotonate to form an alkoxide. But wait, the starting material is an alcoholâ€”maybe an enol ether or something else forms?

Wait, the starting alcohol has a double bond and an OH group. So 1-vinylspiro...non-5-en-1-ol. The OH
