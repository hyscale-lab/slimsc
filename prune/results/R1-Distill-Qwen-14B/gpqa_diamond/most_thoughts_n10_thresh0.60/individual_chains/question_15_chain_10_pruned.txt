Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected using the radial velocity method. They have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. 

The host stars have different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that for a planet to transit, the star's size relative to the planet's orbital distance matters. The probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on, but the probability itself depends on the star's size and the distance of the planet.

Wait, the transit probability formula... I think it's something like (R_star / a)^2 times something else. Maybe the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), or maybe it's (R_star / a)^2? Let me think. The transit depth is (R_planet / R_star)^2, but the probability that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight is a different factor. Oh right, the probability of a transit is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since planetary radius is much smaller than star, it's approximately (R_star) / a. But wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the transit probability formula is actually (R_star / a) multiplied by something else. Oh, right! The probability P is roughly (R_star / a) * (1 / (e)), but since the orbits are circular, e is 0. So that part isn't a factor. Wait no, no, for circular orbits, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else). Let me get this straight.

The probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R*/a) times (1/(1 + (M_p/M*)))^(1/3) or something like that? Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with other factors. Let me think again.

The main factors affecting the transit probability are the size of the star, the orbital distance, and the inclination of the orbit. But since the RV method has already detected the planet, it's already in an orbit with a certain inclination, but I think for the RV method, the minimum mass is determined because the inclination is not known. So for the purpose of transit probability, the prior is based on the statistical likelihood of the inclination being such that a transit occurs.

Wait, the transit probability (for a randomly oriented orbit, given the star's size and the planet's orbital distance) is given by (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (R_star/a)) )? Or maybe it's just (R_star / a). No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, I found online that the probability is approximately (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2)) )) where b is the impact parameter. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a).

Wait, I recall that
