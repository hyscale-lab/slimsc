Okay, so I've got this question about which planet is more likely to transit its star, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Their orbits are both circular. The host stars have the same radius, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the inclination of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability formula. I think the probability is roughly proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something with the orbital distance, maybe the planet's distance from the star). Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

I recall that the transit probability is given by the formula (R_planet / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / m_planet))^(1/3))) or something like that. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some parts. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is higher if the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. But the probability that a randomly oriented orbit is edge-on enough for a transit is higher when the planet's orbit is closer in, because the star's size as seen from Earth is larger in the sky, making it more likely the planet's path crosses our line of sight.

Wait, let me get this straight. The probability of transit is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's roughly R_star / a_planet. But I think the exact formula is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / m_planet))^(1/3))) but no, wait, what's the exact formula?

Alternatively, I remember that the probability that a planet transits is approximately (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / sin i), but since the orientation is random, the average probability is (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else. Wait, maybe it's just (R_star / a_planet), but I might be confusing it with another factor.

Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability
