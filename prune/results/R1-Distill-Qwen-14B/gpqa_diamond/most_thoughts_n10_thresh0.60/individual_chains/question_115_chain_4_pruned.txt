Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate, producing 2 photons. The energies of both photons are the same, and their directions are measured. One is moving in the upper-right direction, the other in the lower-right. What's the angle between them?

Hmm, okay. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and in this case, two photons. Since the particles are an electron and a positron, their collision should be head-on because the electron is moving left and the positron right. Wait, no, wait: the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so it's going to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so it's going to the left. So their paths are along the same line but opposite directions.

Wait, but how about their speeds? Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time, length, etc., are dilated. So the electron has gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2.

Wait, but the rest mass of positron and electron is the same, right? Because they're matter and antimatter. So the rest mass energy is same for both, m_e c². So in their rest frames, each has energy m_e c². But when considering their motion, their relativistic energies are higher.

But when they annihilate, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So the total energy before annihilation is the sum of their relativistic energies, and the total momentum is the sum of their relativistic momenta.

Wait, but since they are moving in opposite directions along the same axis, let's consider that the horizontal axis is, say, the x-axis. So their momenta will be in opposite directions.

So let's model this.

Let me denote the electron as moving to the right (positive x) with gamma_e=4, and the positron moving to the left (negative x) with gamma_p=2.

So the electron's velocity is v_e, and the positron's velocity is v_p. But I don't think I need the actual velocities, just the gamma factors and their momenta.

The relativistic energy of each is gamma * m_e c².

So Energy_e = gamma_e * m_e c² = 4 m_e c².

Energy_p = gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 m_e c².

So the total energy before annihilation is 4 + 2 = 6 m_e c².

Momentum is a vector, so for the electron, its momentum is in the positive x direction, and the positron's is in the negative x.

The relativistic momentum p is gamma * m_e v. Alternatively, since p = gamma m_e v, and v = c² (p/(gamma m_e c)) ), but perhaps there's a better way to compute this.

Wait, another approach: the magnitude of momentum for each particle is p = gamma * m_e * v.

But v can be expressed in terms of gamma. Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).
