Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

The problem has three reactions (A, B, C) and I need to find the correct products from the given options (A to D). Each option gives possible products for all three reactions, so I must figure out each one.

First, looking at Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. The question mentions that sigmatropic rearrangements are involved, and these are pericyclic reactions where a pi bond migrates into a sigma bond. The Cope and Claisen are examples, but this seems a bit different.

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw that structure. It's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon (the 1st carbon). So, the structure is (HOCH2CH3)2NCH2-. Then, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, but the structure is CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH2(OH)CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH? No, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think. The formula for but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, but but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH2OH. Because but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CH-CH2-OH? No, wait, the "en" is between carbons 3 and 4, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH2? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be: the four carbons are 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4, and the OH is on C2. So it's CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2? Wait no, but wait, that's but-2-en-2-ol. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3. No, wait, but that would be 3-penten-2-ol. Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

But-3-en-2-ol: the butenol, with four carbons. The double bond starts at carbon 3, so the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-OH? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2=CHCH2-OH. Wait, but that would be but-2-en-3-ol, right? Wait, no. Maybe it's CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond? No, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, perhaps I should move on and come back to this.

So Reaction 1's reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The conditions are H+ and heat. Hmm, heat and acid. Maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement? Or perhaps it's an acid-catalyzed rearrangement leading to a ring formation.

Alternatively, looking at the products, option A for product A is 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine. That structure suggests a six-membered ring with two oxygen substituents and an amine. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. So 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran would have two double bonds or something? Wait, no, 3,4-dihydro implies that the ring has two adjacent single bonds. Hmm, more accurately, 2H-pyran would have a certain ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction 1 is a Cope rearrangement,
