Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the question carefully. It's a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. My goal is to determine the symmetry group of E.

Let me list out the given reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce the extremely hazardous product E.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak one.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

So, let's think about each step and see if we can identify the possible compounds.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. The product is bright red. Hmm, bright red makes me think of things like rubies or maybe certain metal compounds. Wait, in chemistry, a bright red color is often indicative of certain transition metal compounds. For example, I know that copper(II) compounds are often blue or green, but maybe something else. Oh! What about sulfur? If B is O2, but that might not make sense. Wait, another thought: maybe B is Cl2? But let me think about the stoichiometry.

Wait, 8 equivalents of gas B. Let me think of a reaction that uses 8 equivalents of a diatomic gas. For example, if B is O2, 8 equivalents would be 4 moles (since each mole is 2 molecules). But let me think about the product C. Could C be something like SO3? Wait, sulfur trioxide is a gas, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur, and B is oxygen. So A is S (solid), B is O2. Then, S + O2 → SO3? But wait, the stoichiometry for burning sulfur is S + O2 → SO2, but perhaps in excess O2, it could form SO3. But I thought that for every S atom, you need 3 O atoms. So for each S, 3 O2 molecules would be involved. So perhaps 3 moles of O2 per mole of S. So 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of S would suggest something else.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is strong, G is weak. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids. If F is strong and G weak, maybe F is HCl and G is H2SO4 or something like that. Or wait, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong acid) and G is H3PO4 (weak? No, phosphoric acid is moderately strong). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let's go back. If C is something that upon hydrolysis gives two acids. One strong, one weak. Maybe C is an acid anhydride. For example, if C is something like (SO3), which is a good example of an anhydride. When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Wait, SO3 plus water gives H2SO4, which is a single acid. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait another thought: perhaps C is a sulfite or sulfate. Let me think. If C is Na2SO3 (sodium sulfite), but that's a solid, not a gas. Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfate. Alternatively, if C is an oxide that can form two acids upon hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is a metal, and B is O2, then C would be a metal oxide. But when metal oxides react with water, they typically form metal hydroxides. Hmm, but then the products would be A (the metal) plus hydroxide, which doesn't fit the two acids. So maybe that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that can form two acids when it reacts with water. Let me think of something like (NH4)2SO4. Wait, no, that's ammonium sulfate. On hydrolysis, it might produce NH4OH and H2SO4. But I'm not sure if that fits.

Wait, let's consider the fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include water, ethanol, maybe something like H2O, CH3OH, etc. So, D + B → H.

Let me think about possible D and B. If H is water, then maybe D is H2O, but the reaction would require B to be something else. Alternatively, if D is H2O and B is something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is ethanol. So D and B could be something like C2H5OH, but that might not fit.

Wait, another thought: If D is Cl2 and B is H2O, then their reaction might form HCl and HOCl, but that's a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is something else.

Wait, let's get back to reaction 1. A solid reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form C. Let me think about a reaction where a solid reacts with a diatomic gas in a high stoichiometric ratio. Another possibility is sulfur reacting with oxygen. The formula for SO3 is sulfur trioxide, which is a gas under certain conditions. The reaction is S8 (solid) + 9 O2 → 8 SO3. So in that case, 9 moles of O2 per mole of S8. But wait, the problem states 8 equivalents of B. So if A is S8, each mole of A requires 9 moles of O2, but the question says 8. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe A is FeS (iron(II) sulfide), but that's more of a solid. Reacting with O2 to form Fe2O3 and SO3? Wait, the stoichiometry might not match.

Wait, another angle: the product E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's probably not made from the given reactants. Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like chlorine trifluoride, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So if C is SO3, and D is Cl2, then SO3 + Cl2 → something. Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), which is a toxic gas. Hmm, but let me think about whether that fits.

Wait, another approach: let's think about H. D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Let me think of reactions between two gases. If H is H2O, then maybe D is H2O and B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is Cl2, but that doesn't fit a 1:1 ratio. Wait, when Cl2 reacts with water, it's a 1:1 ratio, producing HCl and HOCl. So if D is Cl2 and B is H2O, then their reaction would produce HCl and HOCl, but that's a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but the product in that case would be a solution, but H is a solvent, so maybe D is Cl2 and B is H2O, and H is HCl and HOCl? Wait, no, because that's a mixture, not a single solvent. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is something else. Like, maybe B is NH3 and D is H2O, but their reaction forms NH4OH (which is a weak acid, but not a solvent). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe D is H2O and B is another gas, but I'm stuck here.

Wait, let's think about products F and G. When C is treated with water, it produces A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, for example, if C is SO3, then SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid). But where does the weak acid come from? That doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride or something like that. Or maybe C is a metal carbonate which upon hydrolysis gives a strong and weak acid. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: if C is (NH4)2SO4 (ammonium sulfate), when it reacts with water, perhaps it doesn't form two acids. Or maybe it's a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, let me think about reaction 3 again. When C reacts with water, it gives back A, F, and G. F is strong, G is weak. So perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acids. For example, perhaps C is something like NaHSO4·2H2SO4, but that's not a real compound. Alternatively, maybe C is a mixed anhydride.

Wait, maybe C is something like (ClO)2. No, that's chlorine dioxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let me think of the possible structures of E to figure out its symmetry. The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E, which is produced in reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

These are all symmetry groups from crystallography. So, the structure of E must belong to one of these point groups.

Looking at the options:

- C2: has a 2-fold rotation axis.
- D4h: has a four-fold rotation axis with horizontal mirror planes.
- D∞h: has an infinite-fold rotation axis (so linear molecules like CO2, H2O).
- C2v: has a 2-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes.

Wait, but D∞h is for linear molecules. So, if E is a linear molecule, then D∞h or C2 would be possible. But wait, D∞h includes a four-fold rotation, which might not fit.

Wait, another approach: let's figure out what E could be, based on the reactions.

If reaction 2 is C + 2 D → E. Let's think of C as SO3, D as Cl2. Then, SO3 + 2 Cl2 → SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride). Thionyl chloride is a toxic gas, which fits the description of E being extremely hazardous.

So if E is SO2Cl2, what's its molecular structure? Thionyl chloride has a structure where S is in the center, with two Cl atoms and two O atoms attached. The structure is similar to SO2, but with two Cl substituting for two of the O atoms. So, the molecule is tetrahedral, with a trigonal pyramidal geometry, similar to water or ammonia.

Wait, the structure of SO2Cl2 is tetrahedral. The molecule has a tetrahedral symmetry, which belongs to theTd point group. But wait, the options don't include Td. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a C2v symmetry. Let me think: in a tetrahedral molecule, the symmetry depends on the arrangement of substituents. If the molecule has two Cl atoms and two O atoms, it might have a certain symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure of E. Maybe E is something else. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Its structure is similar to SO2, with two Cl atoms attached. The molecule is planar, with a central carbon atom, two Cl, and two O atoms. So, the structure is trigonal planar. The point group for COCl2 is D2h or maybe D3h? Wait, no, for a trigonal planar molecule with two identical substituents and two others, the point group is D2h. But wait, COCl2 has a structure where all three substituents (two Cl and one O?) No, wait, COCl2 has two Cl and two O? No, wait, the formula is COCl2: the central C is connected to two Cl and one O (double bond?), so the actual structure is more like O=C(Cl)2. Wait, that's not correct. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, so the central carbon is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So, the molecule is planar, with a trigonal planar geometry. The point group is D2h. But the options don't have D2h. Wait, the options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. If E is SO2Cl2, which is tetrahedral, its point group is Td, but that's not an option. So perhaps my initial assumption about E's structure is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe E is another molecule. What else could E be?

Let me think of another approach. Let's figure out what A, B, C, etc., could be.

In reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red).

Bright red product C suggests perhaps CuO? No, that's black. Alternatively, maybe it's a chromium compound, but chromium(III) oxide is green. Alternatively, perhaps it's sulfur trioxide (SO3), which is a colorless gas. Wait, but the question says bright red. Oh! Wait, maybe C is a different compound. What about ruby? That's a solid, but C is a product of a reaction with gas B, so perhaps solid C isn't the case. Alternatively, maybe C is a polymer, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2, and A is P (phosphorus). Then, P + O2 → P4O10. Wait, but the reaction would require more O2. Let me think about the stoichiometry. The formula for P4O10 is P:O = 4:10 = 2:5. So for each P4 molecule (which is solid), you need 5 O2 molecules. So for 1 mole of P4, 5 moles of O2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (O2) for 1 mole of A. So if A is P4, then 8 O2 would be more than needed for P4O10. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe A is S8 (sulfur), which when burned in O2 forms SO2 (but SO2 is a gas, colorless). Alternatively, if it's SO3, which is also a gas but colorless. Wait, but the product C is bright red. So maybe I'm wrong about C's identity.

Another thought: perhaps C is a manganese compound. Manganese(II) oxide is black, but maybe another compound is red. Alternatively, maybe C is a cobalt compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that's red. I'm drawing a blank here. Let me think of another approach.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G.

If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, maybe F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is H3PO4 (moderately strong but less so than H2SO4). But how would C produce two different acids? For example, if C is Ca3(PO4)2·H2O (but that's not likely), but when it reacts with water, perhaps it forms Ca(OH)2 and H3PO4. Wait, but that's more of a hydrolysis reaction.

Alternatively, if C is a mixed salt, like a sulfite and another. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps C is calcium sulfate hemihydrate, but that's more of a solid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3·H2O (but I'm not sure).

Alternatively, if C is a sulfate like Na2SO4, which upon hydrolysis would form NaOH and H2SO4, but that doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate. For example, nitric acid anhydride, which is not a real compound. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like (NH4)2SO4 (ammonium sulfate), which upon hydrolysis would produce NH4OH (a weak acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). That fits! Because when ammonium sulfate reacts with water, it can hydrolyze into NH4OH and H2SO4. So F would be H2SO4 (strong acid) and G would be NH4OH (a weak acid, but perhaps it's a stronger acid than others).

So, if C is (NH4)2SO4, let's see reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So (NH4)2SO4 is the product.

What is A in this case? (NH4)2SO4 is formed from NH4+ and SO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps A is NH4HSO4 (but that's a solid), which when heated might lose a water molecule to form (NH4)2SO4. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, maybe A is something else. Let me think about the reaction: A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form (NH4)2SO4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is H2S, a gas, but that doesn't fit the solid description.

Hmm, this approach might not be working. Let me try to think about what E could be.

Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If C is (NH4)2SO4, and D is Cl2, then perhaps E is NH2Cl (chloramine) and HCl. But that doesn't fit the 2 equivalents of D.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2Cl2 as I thought earlier. So, if C is SO3 and D is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be SO3 + 2 Cl2 → SO2Cl2 + Cl2O? No, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is thionyl chloride (SOCl2), which is a toxic gas. Let me think about the reaction: SO3 + Cl2 → SO2Cl2 + OCl2? Wait, not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is SO3 + 2 Cl2 → SO2Cl2 + Cl2O, but I'm not confident.

Assuming E is SO2Cl2, what's its structure? Its structure is similar to SO2 but with two Cl atoms replacing two O atoms. So the central S is connected to two Cl, one O, and another O (but wait, that can't be right because SO2 has two O's). Wait, SO2Cl2 molecule has a central S with two Cl and two O in a tetrahedral arrangement. So the structure is tetrahedral, and the point group would be Td. But the options don't include Td, so perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe E is a different molecule. Let me think of another possibility. If E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a highly toxic gas. Its structure is planar, trigonal, with a central C connected to two Cl and one O. The point group for COCl2 is D2h, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps that's not it either.

Wait, perhaps E is something else. Let's think of E as a molecule with a C2v symmetry. Which of the options fit that? Option D is C2v. So what's a molecule with a C2v symmetry?

C2v has a two-fold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. A common example is H2O (water), which has a C2v symmetry. Wait, but E is produced in a reaction with C and D. If E is something like H2O, that's possible, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the earlier reactions.

Alternatively, maybe E is a linear molecule, which would have D∞h symmetry. For example, a diatomic molecule like O2 or CO2. But O2 is diatomic and has D∞h symmetry. But would E be O2? No, because reaction 2 produces E from C and D. Alternatively, maybe E is something like ClO2, which is a planar molecule with C2v symmetry. Wait, ClO2 has a structure where Cl is in the center with four O atoms arranged in a tetrahedron, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, but that's trigonal planar with D3h symmetry.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of another angle.

Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If H is H2O, then D and B could be H2O and another gas. But that doesn't fit well. Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is NH3, and their reaction forms NH4OH (which is a weak acid), but that's not a common solvent. Alternatively, H could be ethanol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about D. Since D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. If H is a common solvent like ethanol, then D and B could be something that reacts to form ethanol. For example, D could be CO2 and B could be something else, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps H is ethylene glycol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is something like NaOH, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe H is a solution of NaOH, but that's a liquid.

Alternatively, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is H2O, making HCl and HOCl, but that's a solution, not a pure solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is another gas. Maybe B is O2 and D is H2O, but their reaction forms H2O2, which is a solvent. So H would be H2O2. So D is H2O, B is O2, and H is H2O2. Then, the reaction would be 2 H2O + O2 → 2 H2O2. But that would be a 2:1 ratio of H2O to O2, which doesn't fit the 1:1 ratio given in reaction 4.

Hmm, I'm stuck here. Let me try to think again about reaction 1.

If reaction 1 produces a bright red product C. One possibility is that C is an oxide of a transition metal that gives a red color. For example, Mn2O7 is a dark purple solid, but not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound. Wait, maybe C is a form of vanadium oxide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a compound of iron that's red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish, but it's a solid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a gas. If C is a gas, then what could it be that's bright red? I'm not recalling any common bright red gases. Maybe a polymer isn't likely.

Alternatively, perhaps C isn't a solid but another state, but the initial reaction says A is a solid, so C could be a gas.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is Cl2, which is a green gas. If A is a metal, perhaps their reaction forms a chloride. But how about 8 equivalents?

Wait, if A is Fe, and B is Cl2, then Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The reaction requires one mole of Fe and three moles of Cl2, but the question states 8 equivalents of B (Cl2) per mole of A. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is Al and B is Cl2. The reaction would be 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. So for 1 mole of Al, 3 moles of Cl2 are needed. But the problem says 8 equivalents, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track with B being Cl2. Maybe B is O2.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, A is the original solid, and F and G are acids. So, C is likely an acid anhydride or a salt that can hydrolyze to form acids.

If C is an acid anhydride, like SO3, which upon hydrolysis gives H2SO4, but that's a single strong acid. So maybe C is a mixed anhydride, like HSO4·H2SO4, which upon hydrolysis could give two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3, which upon hydrolysis gives NaOH and CO2, but that would produce a base and a gas, not two acids.

Wait, another possibility: C could be a sulfite, like Na2SO3. When it hydrolyzes, it might produce H2SO3 (which is a weak acid, but unstable) and NaOH, but that's not two acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a phosphate, like Na3PO4, which upon hydrolysis would produce NaOH and H3PO4. So F could be H3PO4 (weak acid) and G could be NaOH (strong base), but the question states that F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a polymeric compound. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, but that's more likely to form bases upon hydrolysis.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to summarize what I know so far:

- Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B → C (bright red, likely a gas)
- Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
- Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
- Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent)

Assuming reaction 4 produces a solvent, perhaps H is H2O (but how?), or ethanol, or something else.

Wait, maybe reaction 4 is D + B → H (solvent), and H is NaOH solution. But that's not a pure solvent; perhaps H is something like NH3, which is a solvent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is H2O and B is NH3. Their reaction would produce NH4OH, which is a weak acid, acting as a solvent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps H is something like HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps H is methanol (CH3OH), which is a common solvent. Then, reaction 4 would be D + B → CH3OH. So D and B must be something that when reacted form methanol. For example, D could be CO and B could be H2, but that's the reaction for methanol synthesis, which is 2 H2 + CO → CH3OH. So that's a 1:1 ratio for H2 and CO, which would fit the 1:1 ratio in reaction 4. So D is CO and B is H2.

Wait, that's an interesting possibility. So:

- Reaction 4: CO (D) + H2 (B) → CH3OH (H, a solvent)

That fits the 1:1 ratio. So D is CO, B is H2.

Now, looking back at reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 H2 → C (bright red)

A solid reacting with H2 in a high stoichiometric ratio. What solid reacts with H2 in such a way? Perhaps a metal, but most metals react with H2 under certain conditions. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide that reacts with H2 to form water and the metal. But let's think of the product C being bright red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A is a metal, and B is H2. So, the reaction could be something like Fe3O4 + H2 → Fe + H2O. But that's a reduction reaction. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Alternatively, if A is a metal oxide, like CuO, and B is H2, the reaction would be CuO + H2 → Cu + H2O. But again, I'm not sure about the 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps A is a sulfur compound. Sulfur (S8) can react with H2 under certain conditions. Let me think: S8 + H2 → SH4? No, that's not a real reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A is a polymer that reacts with H2.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal such as magnesium, and the reaction is Mg + H2 → MgH2. But MgH2 is a solid, but I'm not sure if that's bright red.

Alternatively, another possibility: if A is a solid like Na2O, and B is H2, the reaction would be Na2O + H2 → 2 Na + H2O. But the product C would be H2O, which is colorless, not bright red.

Hmm, maybe I'm off track again. Let me think about reaction 3 again.

If C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid), and considering that F and G are acids, perhaps C is an acid anhydride that upon hydrolysis produces two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: if C is a mixed anhydride, like HSO4·H2SO4. Upon hydrolysis, this would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and some other acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrated ester that upon hydrolysis forms two acids. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfonic acid anhydride, but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on reaction 2 again. If C is SO3 and D is Cl2, then reaction 2 would produce SO2Cl2. Let me think about the structure of SO2Cl2 again. It's a tetrahedral molecule with S in the center, bonded to two Cl atoms and two O atoms. The molecular symmetry group for a tetrahedral molecule with two different substituents (Cl and O) would be C2v. Because in a tetrahedral arrangement, if two substituents are the same (like two Cl), and the other two are the same (like two O), the molecule would have a two-fold rotation axis (C2) and two mirror planes (v). So the point group would be C2v, which is option D.

But earlier I thought that SO2Cl2 has a Td symmetry, but maybe that's incorrect. Let me think: if a molecule has a central atom with four substituents, two of one kind and two of another, the symmetry would be D2h if all four substituents are in a plane (like in SO2Cl2, which I think has a bent structure, more like a trigonal planar arrangement), but no, SO2Cl2 is actually a tetrahedral molecule, but wait, maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, no, SO2Cl2 is a trigonal planar molecule. Let me look it up mentally. Wait, SO2Cl2 exists as a gas and has a structure where the central sulfur is double-bonded to two oxygen atoms and single-bonded to two chlorine atoms. So the arrangement is trigonal planar, similar to SO2. So the point group would be D2h, but that's not one of the options.

Hmm, but the options don't include D2h. So perhaps my assumption about E is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a different molecule. Let me think: if E is phosgene (COCl2), which is a planar molecule with a central carbon, two Cl, and one O (double bond). Its point group is D2h, which again doesn't match the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) C2

B) D4h

C) D∞h

D) C2v

If E is a molecule with a C2v symmetry, which option D is, then what could E be?

One example of a C2v symmetry is a molecule like H2O (water), which has a bent structure with a two-fold rotation axis and two mirror planes. But if E is H2O, that doesn't fit the earlier reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has a trigonal planar structure with D3h symmetry, but that's not an option.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps E is a molecule like CH2Cl2 (dichloromethane), which is tetrahedral and has a C2v symmetry. But CH2Cl2 is a solvent, not a product formed from C and D in reaction 2.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like O=C=O (CO2), which has D∞h symmetry. So option C is D∞h, which would fit CO2. But would E be CO2?

Let me think about reaction 2: C + 2 D → E.

If E is CO2, then D must be something that when reacted with C (maybe CH4) produces CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is CO and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to find another angle.

If reaction 3 produces two acids, F and G, with F being strong and G weak, perhaps F is H2SO4 and G is H2CO3 (carbonic acid, which is weak). So C could be a carbonate anhydride, like CO3^2-.

Wait, but carbonate anhydrides are not common. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite anhydride, like SO3.

Wait, another thought: if C is SO3, then reaction 3 would be SO3 + H2O → H2SO4 (strong acid) and possibly another product. But that doesn't fit two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mixed anhydride like HSO4·H2SO4, which upon hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 and another acid.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peracid, but that may not fit.

Wait, maybe C is a carbonate, like Na2CO3. Then, hydrolysis would produce NaOH and CO2, but CO2 is a gas and not an acid. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to make some assumptions.

Assuming E is SO2Cl2, which is a tetrahedral molecule with C2v symmetry. So the correct answer would be option D) C2v.

Alternatively, if E is a linear molecule like CO2, which has D∞h symmetry (option C), but I don't think that fits.

So, based on the reactions, I think E is SO2Cl2, which has a C2v symmetry.


The question involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests a transition metal compound, but the exact identity of C is unclear. A plausible assumption is that C could be a gas like SO3 (sulfur trioxide), which is colorless, but this contradicts the "bright red" description. Despite this, SO3 is used for further analysis due to its reactivity.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. If C is SO3 and D is Cl2, the reaction could form SO2Cl2 (thionyl chloride), a toxic gas. SO2Cl2 has a tetrahedral structure with sulfur at the center, bonded to two chlorine atoms and two oxygen atoms.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If C is SO3, hydrolysis would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and possibly another acid, but this does not perfectly align with the description. However, this assumption is consistent with the reactivity of SO3.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If D is Cl2 and B is H2O, their reaction could produce HCl and HOCl, but this does not fit the description of H as a single solvent. Despite this, the focus remains on Reaction 2 for determining E's symmetry.

5. **Symmetry Analysis of E**: If E is SO2Cl2, its tetrahedral structure has a two-fold rotation axis (C2) and two vertical mirror planes (v), giving it a molecular symmetry group of C2v. This matches the description of E as a tetrahedral molecule with the given symmetry.

Given the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **C2v**.
