Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The state of the system is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, right? So maybe I should think of this as a vector in a 3-dimensional space. Oh, but wait, maybe I should normalize it because in quantum states, the vector should have unit length. Let me check that first.

The vector is (-1, 2, 1). So the norm is the square root of (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2. That's 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Oh, right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are normalized, so I need to account for that.

Then there are two operators, P and Q. The operator P has a matrix with first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that's a 3x3 matrix. And the operator Q has a matrix with first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1,0,-1.

The question is about measuring P and then immediately measuring Q. We need the probability that P yields 0 and Q yields -1.

Wait, so the process is: first measure P, getting 0, then measure Q and get -1. Since the measurements are done in sequence, the second measurement is done on the state that resulted from the first measurement.

So I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for operator P and Q.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think. When you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenvector of that observable. So first, when I measure P, if I get 0, the state collapses to the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 of P.

Then, when I measure Q on this new state, the probability of getting -1 depends on the overlap between this state and the eigenvector of Q corresponding to eigenvalue -1.

So the overall probability is the probability of getting 0 for P, multiplied by the probability of getting -1 for Q in the new state.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this by finding the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, see what the state becomes after the measurement, and compute the probability of Q being -1.

First step: Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Operator P's matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Let me write this as a matrix:

[ [0, 1/√2, 0],
  [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
  [0, 1/√2, 0
