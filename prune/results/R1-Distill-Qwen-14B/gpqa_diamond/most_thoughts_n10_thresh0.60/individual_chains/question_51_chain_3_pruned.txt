Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, but I'll try to work it out.

Alright, so I remember that when you have a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere's presence affects the potential. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will be neutralized by the ground. Wait, no, actually for a conducting sphere, the charges would redistribute themselves such that the surface is equipotential. Oh right, and because it's grounded, any induced charges on the sphere would be canceled by charges leaving or entering from the ground. So the sphere ends up with no net charge, but the charge distribution is induced by the external charge q.

Wait, when you place a charge near a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges will arrange themselves in a way that the potential on the surface is constant. For a conducting sphere, the induced charge will be such that the external charge doesn't penetrate the conductor. So the sphere's surface would have induced charges, but the total charge on the sphere would be zero because it's grounded. Or wait, no. If the charge q is outside the sphere, the sphere being a conductor, the charges would redistribute. Wait, I'm confusing things.

Let me think about the method of images. Oh right, the method of images is used to solve problems involving charges and conductors. For a point charge near a conducting sphere, we can model it by replacing the sphere with an image charge.

So the real charge is q, and the image charge would be inside the sphere. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so the net charge on the sphere should be zero. Hmm, how does that work?

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should approach this using the concept of potential. The potential energy of the system would be the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, its potential is zero. Oh, wait, the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded. So the potential at the point where the charge is placed is due to both the charge on the sphere and the charge q itself.

Wait, no. The potential due to the sphere would affect the charge q. Or maybe I should think about the potential energy as the energy stored in the system
