Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question involves two reactions done by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. I need to determine how many peaks they'll see in each case. The options are provided, so I'll have to work through each part carefully.

First, let's break down what each reaction is doing.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by an acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. When it's used on a ketone, like in hexan-3-one, it should reduce the ketone group to a secondary alcohol. So the starting material is a ketone; after reduction, it becomes a secondary alcohol.

Wait, structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw that. Hexan-3-one is CH3-CO-(CH2)3-CH3. But wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think: the carbon chain is six carbons, with the ketone on C3. So structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe better to number: 1 2 3 4 5 6. So position 3 is the ketone. So structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, but wait, 3 would be the third carbon, so it would be (CH2)2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, (CH2)2 before the ketone? Let's see: 1, 2, 3. So hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. But wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So on the fifth carbon (position 5), there's a methoxy group. So the structure is:
