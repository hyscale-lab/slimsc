Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, there's a supernova, and part of its ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in their own inertial frames. Hmm, inertial frames mean no acceleration, right? So, no gravity or other forces acting on them in this scenario.

The question is asking, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, but the time given is in the ejecta's frame, so we need to relate that to the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the speed is 6e4 km/s. But wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add like that. Oh wait, maybe it's non-relativistic because 60,000 km/s is a huge speed. Wait, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's a significant fraction. So, maybe relativistic effects come into play here.

Wait, the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so we don't have to worry about those. So, it's a straight line motion problem.

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta part is moving towards the center at 60,
