Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and the answer should be in Joules.

The options are A to D, with some numbers given. I need to find the correct one.

Hmm, so I'm thinking about electric potential energy here. Because we're dealing with charges and potential energy, right? The potential energy between point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula. But wait, since potential energy is a scalar quantity, it's additive. So I need to calculate the potential energy between each pair of charges and sum them all up.

Wait, but wait. The setup is that twelve charges are each 2 meters from point P, and one charge is fixed at P. So the system has 13 charges: one at P and twelve at 2m away from P.

So each of the twelve charges is 2 meters apart from the fixed charge at P. But what about the interactions between the twelve charges themselves? Oh right, because each of the twelve is at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances aren't specified. So they're all at the same point, or are they? No, if they're constrained to stay 2 m from P, but their positions relative to each other could vary. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify their mutual distances, so maybe we need to assume they are all at the same point, but that doesn't make sense because then they'd be on top of each other, which would imply zero mutual distance, leading to infinite potential energy. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the twelve charges are arranged in a way that they're each at a distance of 2 meters from P, but their positions are uniform around P. But wait, the problem says each is at 2 meters from P, so they must lie on a sphere of radius 2 meters. But their exact arrangement isn't specified, so maybe the problem simplifies the situation by considering that the potential energy between the twelve charges is zero, or perhaps they
