Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. This leads to the existence of enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. These enantiomers are optically active, hence the term optical isomerism.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four, labeled 1 to 4. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
Hmm, this sounds a bit complex. So, it's a biphenyl structure. The substituents are nitro groups at the 6' position and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions. Also, the biphenyl is connected at the 1 and 1' positions. So, the structure has two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. 

Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but for isomerism, I think about whether there's a plane of symmetry. But wait, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, it might have a chiral center or perhaps a center of asymmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule could have a plane of symmetry. Let me visualize the structure: each phenyl ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. The central bond is single, allowing rotation. But wait, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole is not symmetrical, maybe it's chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are in a symmetric arrangement, then it won't be chiral. For example, if each substituent is in a position that mirrors the other, the molecule could be achiral. But in this case, the positions are 2 and 6 on each ring, and the nitro groups are both on the same ring. Wait, no, wait. The 6 and 6' are on each ring, right? So 6 on the first ring and 6' on the second. So each ring has a nitro group at 6, and a carboxylate
