Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read it again. So there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But I don't think the masses matter for this particular question, since it's about elemental abundances.

The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for equivalent width. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh wait, and the photospheric composition of the Sun is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So we can get the solar abundances from that.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or maybe the ratio [Si_1 / Si_2]?

Wait, no, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms" which I think means (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2). But wait, maybe it's [Si/H]_1 divided by [Si/H]_2, which would be the ratio between their silicon to hydrogen ratios.

But let's think step by step. Let's outline what I know.

First, the Sun's composition:
For Fe: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16
