Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are fast-decaying, traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma is high, but in this case, initially, it's about 20. Now, when the gamma increases, how does that affect the distance they travel before decaying?

Wait, the key here is probably the proper lifetime of the particle and how time dilation affects it. The particles are fast-decaying, so their lifetime is short, but from our lab frame, their lifetime is longer due to gamma. So, the distance they can travel before decaying would be gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (c times that, I think).

Let me think about the initial scenario. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. When the Lorentz factor is 20, on average, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So, maybe the average distance they travel is such that only a third make it to 30 meters. But wait, if gamma increases, their lifetime is longer, so they should be able to travel further, right? So, if gamma is higher, more particles would reach the walls.

Wait, the problem says that initially, one third reach the walls. So, perhaps when gamma increases, more particles can make it. So the question is, what gamma makes two-thirds reach the walls.

So, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls depends on the ratio of the distance they can travel (gamma * c * tau) to the detector radius, where tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The particles are produced at the center of the detector. So the distance to the wall is 30 meters. The particles have to reach that distance before decaying.

The time it takes for a particle to
