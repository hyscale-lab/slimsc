Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see what I can figure out here.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so this is a problem involving relative velocity and time dilation, right? Because each frame is moving relative to the other, their measurements of time and distance will differ.

Wait, but wait. Both frames are inertial, so maybe we can use the Galilean transformations or the Lorentz transformations. But wait, 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, so 60,000 is like 0.2c. So we can't neglect relativistic effects here. So we need to use special relativity.

Wait, but the problem is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, I think we need to find the time that passes in the galaxy's frame and then multiply by the velocity of the ejecta in that frame.

Alternatively, maybe the other way around. Let me think.
