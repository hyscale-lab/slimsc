Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two planets around a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit. Its transit impact parameter is 0.2, and it's around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that transit and occultation events happen when one body passes in front of and behind the other from our point of view. For the transit, the planet passes in front of the star; for occultation, the planet is behind the star from our view. Both events require that the orbital planes are aligned so that these events can occur.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum period of the second planet. I think the key here is that both planets must have their orbital periods such that their orbital speeds are synchronized in a way that allows these events to happen. Or maybe it's about the size of their orbits relative to each other?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of conjunctions. For two planets to have transits and occultations, their orbits must be such that they can periodically align in front of and behind the star. So the orbital period of the second planet must be such that their orbital speeds allow for these events to occur.

Wait, but how do the orbital periods relate? Maybe it's about their orbital velocities. The planet with the shorter period (3 days) is closer to the star, right? Because orbital period and distance are related by Kepler's third law.

Oh right, Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since both planets are around the same star, which has a mass we can compute, but the problem might not require that because we can relate the periods and distances proportionally.

So the first planet has a period of 3 days. Let's denote that as P1, and the second planet's period as P2. According to Kepler's third law, (P1/P2)^2 = (a1
