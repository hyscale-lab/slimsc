Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that, so 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, the mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—maybe it's all about electric potential energy.

Now, out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. Hmm, so the setup is that there's a central charge, and 12 others are arranged around it, each 2 meters away. So I imagine this as a central charge with 12 others in a circular arrangement or something, but maybe the exact arrangement isn't necessary. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So I think this is about calculating the electric potential energy since all the charges are fixed except the 13th. Wait, no, the 13th is fixed at P, so maybe all the other 12 are fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed—so the system's configuration is fixed. So the total energy here is the sum of all the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but how do I calculate the potential energy of a system of charges?
