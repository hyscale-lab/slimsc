Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. It oscillates, so it must be radiating. The radiation has a wavelength lambda, and in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis.

Our goal is to find two things: the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda.

First, I remember that when a charge oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The dipole radiation is a common case. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern depends on the angle theta.

Wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole is strongest along the equator, right? Because the dipole's radiation is maximum at 90 degrees from its axis. But wait, wait, noâ€”actually, for a dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to (sin theta)^2. So maximum at theta = 90 degrees. So that's the peak. The intensity (which is power per unit solid angle) would be highest there.

So the function f(theta) would peak at theta = 90. So for theta = 30 degrees, it's less than the maximum. Let me think about the fraction.

The total power radiated is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. So the maximum power A is the maximum value of f(theta) multiplied by 4 pi? No, wait, no: the maximum power would be f(theta_max) times the solid angle element at that point. Wait, no. Actually, the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So A is the maximum value of f, perhaps.

Wait no, wait. The problem says 'the maximum power thus radiated is A', which I think refers to the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle. Because in the question, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f has a maximum value A. So the maximum f is A, which occurs at theta=90 degrees because (sin theta)^2 is 1 there.

So when theta=30 degrees, sin theta is 0.5, so sin^2 theta is 0.25. So the power at theta=30 would be 0.25 * A. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but maybe I should think about the form of f as a function of lambda. The question asks for the possible form of f. Options include lambda^-4, lambda^-3, etc.

In the dipole radiation formula, the power radiated per unit solid angle (the intensity) is proportional to (sin theta)^2 and to (omega^4)/(lambda^4) or something like that. Let me think.

The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The average power P is ( (e^2 a^2 )/(6 pi epsilon0 c^3) ) * (
