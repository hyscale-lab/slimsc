Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to untangle all the information given.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Another clue is that when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's break this down. Let me think about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal numbers of n and p. Common gases where protons equal neutrons... Well, for example, H2O: each molecule has 8 neutrons (O has 8, H has 1 each, so total protons: 2*(1) +8=10. Neutrons: O has 8 neutrons, H has 0, so 8. So 8 neutrons, 10 protons. No, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe another gas. Let's think of something else.

Wait, maybe a noble gas? If W is a noble gas, maybe something like krypton? But wait, Kr's atomic number is 36, so each atom has 36 protons and 36 neutrons (since it's a noble gas, likely a monoatomic molecule). So if W is Kr, each molecule is Kr, so protons=36, neutrons=36. That fits the condition. Alternatively, maybe another noble gas, like Ar? Ar is 18 protons, 18 neutrons.

Wait, but the reaction produces a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with a melting point near 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances have a melting point around that? Maybe water? Wait, water freezes at 273 K (0 C), so 277 is near that. So B could be water, but it's melting point is near 277 K. So B could be ice? Or maybe another substance that melts just above that.

Wait, another approach: the precipitate G upon heating releases B. If G is a salt that when heated gives water, perhaps. Like, maybe a hydrate? For example, when heated, a hydrate loses water. So heating G gives B, which is water. That would fit, because when G is heated, it loses water (W?), but wait, W is the gas produced in the initial reaction. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is something like a metal reacting with water, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a double displacement reaction leading to a precipitate. Let me think about possible reactions.

Substance X reacts violently with a liquid Y. Let's think about common reactions. Maybe
