Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq results and why some peaks disappeared when using a different fixation method. Hmm, let me think about what I know about ChIP-seq and the fixation process.

ChIP-seq is used to find where transcription factors bind on the DNA. The process usually starts with crosslinking the proteins to DNA, which is done to preserve the binding sites. Then you shear the DNA, immunoprecipitate with an antibody specific to the protein of interest, and then sequence the DNA fragments that were bound.

So the question says they used PFA-fixed samples with an antibody to IKAROS in human B cells. Then when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, the peaks disappeared. Wait, PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a common crosslinker. DSG is disuccinimide, another crosslinker. Oh, so maybe the fixation method affects what regions are successfully immunoprecipitated.

I remember that different crosslinkers have different abilities to fix proteins to DNA. PFA is a reversible crosslinker, right? Or wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Actually, PFA is a common fixative that forms covalent bonds between proteins and DNA. DSG is a more efficient crosslinker for proteins, maybe better for crosslinking proteins that are in close proximity but not directly attached to DNA, like in protein complexes.

Wait, in ChIP, the goal is to fix the protein-DNA interactions. So if you have a protein that's bound to DNA, using a strong crosslinker might preserve that. But sometimes, when using a mix of crosslinkers, maybe some regions get over-fixed or under-fixed. Alternatively, perhaps certain regions are more susceptible to shearing or not efficiently crosslinked.

The question states that when PFA+DSG was used, the peaks disappeared. So the initial peaks were found when only PFA was used, but when adding DSG, they're gone. That suggests that the peaks were only present in the first case, meaning that with PFA, you can detect the binding, but with the stronger crosslinking (PFA+DSG), you can't. Hmm, why would that happen?

Wait, I think that some regions of the genome are more prone to being cut or sheared, depending on the crosslinkers. Or maybe some regions are more resistant to the crosslinking. For example, regions that are highly repetitive or have a lot of secondary structure might not crosslink as efficiently.
