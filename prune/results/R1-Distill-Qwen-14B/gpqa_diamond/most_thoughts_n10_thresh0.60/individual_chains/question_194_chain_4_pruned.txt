Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? Because beta is 1/(kT), so each term is exp(-E/(kT)). So I need to figure out all possible energy values and how many states correspond to each.

Each spin has two possible states, so three spins have 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all and calculate the energy for each.

But wait, maybe there's an easier way. Let's think in terms of the pairwise products. The energy is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair. So each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. Because S_i and S_j are each either +1 or -1, their product is +1 if they are the same and -1 if different.

So, E = -J (sum of three terms). Let me see, each term in the sum is either +1 or -1. So the sum could vary.

Wait, but how many possible values can the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 take? Let's consider all possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to categorize the states based on how many pairs are aligned (i.e., their product is +1). Let me think: each pair contributes either +1 or -1 to the sum. So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, let's see. For three pairs, the possible sum could be:

If all three pairs are +1: sum = 3 → E = -J*(3) = -3J.

If two pairs are +1 and one is -1: sum = 2 -1 = 1 → E = -J*(1) = -J.

If one pair is +1 and two are -1: sum = 1 -2 = -1 → E = J.

Wait, no: wait, each term is S_i S_j. So the sum could be 3 (all same), or 1 (two same, one different), or -1 (one same, two different
