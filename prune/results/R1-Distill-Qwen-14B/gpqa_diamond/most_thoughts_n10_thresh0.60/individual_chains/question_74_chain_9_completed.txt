Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the probability of an atom decaying after a certain time. Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Oh right, the decay probability doesn't depend on the time already passed, which is called the memoryless property. So even if 50 minutes have gone by without decay, the next 150 minutes are treated the same as any other period.

Wait, the given data is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So we can model this with the decay formula. The formula for the probability of decay is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. Or wait, sometimes it's written as P(t) = e^(-λt) being the probability of not decaying. Oh no, wait, correction: the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that, right?

So in the problem, after 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%, which is 0.32. So 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. So e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that. Ln(0.68) is approximately... let me think, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less, so maybe around -0.3857? So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, using a calculator, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ is 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is, after 50 minutes have passed without decay, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? So the total time since the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, because of the memoryless property, the probability is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now, regardless of past time. So I can just compute the probability for t=150 minutes.

So P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ * 150). Let's plug in λ. λ is 0.0038566. So 150 * λ is 150 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.57849. So e^-0.57849 ≈ what? Let me think, e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.57849 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Maybe approximately 0.5615. So 1 - 0.5615 is about 0.4385, so 43.85% which is approximately 44%. Looking at the options, option A is 44%.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me think again.

The given data is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ) = 0.68. So λ = ln(1/0.68)/100. Wait, because e^(-x) = 0.68 → x = ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.470588). Wait, ln(1/0.68) is the same as -ln(0.68). Oh, right, that's correct. So λ is (ln(1/0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 ≈ 0.0038566.

Then, for 150 minutes, the exponent is 150 * 0.0038566 ≈ 0.5785. So e^-0.5785 ≈ let's compute it more accurately. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute e^-0.5785. Let's see, e^0.5 is about 1.6487, so e^0.5785 is higher. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the Taylor series expansion, but that's time-consuming. Alternatively, since I know e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, and e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.5785 is 0.0785 above 0.5. Hmm, perhaps the value is around 0.56. So 1 - 0.56 → 0.44, so 44%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, so that's the answer. But wait, in the options, A is 44%, D is 48%. Let me think again. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the actual value more accurately. Let me compute λ more precisely. So ln(0.68) = -0.38566248. So λ = 0.38566248 / 100 = 0.0038566248 per minute.

So for 150 minutes: λ*t = 0.0038566248 * 150 = 0.57849372.

Compute e^-0.57849372. Let's compute this using more precise methods. Oh, I can use a calculator, but since I don't have one, perhaps approximate. I know that ln(2) is approx 0.6931, so e^-0.6931 is 0.5. So 0.5785 is less than 0.6931, so e^-0.5785 is higher than 0.5.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for e^-x as 1 - x + x²/2 - x³/6 + ... but that's tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation:

e^-x ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x^3/6.

x is 0.5785. So let's compute:

1 - 0.5785 = 0.4215

+ (0.5785)^2 / 2 → 0.5785^2 = 0.3346 → divided by 2 → 0.1673 → 0.4215 +0.1673 = 0.5888

- (0.5785)^3 /6 → 0.5785^3 ≈ 0.5785 *0.3346 ≈ 0.1938 → divided by 6 → ~0.0323 → 0.5888 -0.0323 → 0.5565

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5565. So 1 - 0.5565 = 0.4435 → 44.35%, which is approximately 44%, so option A is correct.

Wait, but I'm getting around 44% but the options have 44% as A and 48% as D. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps the decay is modeled by the half-life formula. The half-life T_1/2 is related to the decay constant λ by T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ. So if I can find the half-life, maybe that's easier.

Given that in 100 minutes, 32% decay, which is 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100) → e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking natural log: -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = (-ln(0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 → 0.0038566 per min.

So the half-life T_1/2 = ln(2)/λ ≈ 0.6931 / 0.0038566 ≈ 180 minutes. So every 180 minutes, half of the atoms decay.

Wait, but the question is about 150 minutes. Hmm, maybe it's better to compute the probability for 150 minutes.

Alternatively, perhaps using the half-life approach, but that might complicate. Let me think. If the half-life is about 180 minutes, then in 150 minutes, which is 150/180 ≈ 5/6 ≈ 0.8333 of a half-life.

The fraction remaining would be (1/2)^(t / T_1/2) = (0.5)^(5/6) ≈ 0.5^0.8333. Hmm, 0.5^0.8333 is about 0.5^(5/6) → which is the same as (0.5^(1/6))^5. The sixth root of 0.5 is approximately 0.917. So (0.917)^5 ≈ 0.917^2=0.84, then 0.84 * 0.917 ≈ 0.770 → 0.770^2 ≈ 0.59. Wait, that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, perhaps a better way. 

But this seems more complicated. Maybe sticking to the initial approach is better. So earlier calculations gave me about 44%, which is option A. But the options include 48%, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the exponent calculation?

Wait, let's compute more accurately. Let me compute e^(-0.5785) using a calculator-like approach. The natural exponent of -0.5785.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that e^0.5785 is approximately 1.783 (since e^0.5=1.6487, e^0.6=1.8221). So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Let's compute it using a linear approximation. Between x=0.5 (e^0.5=1.6487) and x=0.6 (e^0.6=1.8221), the slope is (1.8221-1.6487)/(0.6-0.5) )= 0.1734 per 0.1. So for 0.5785, which is 0.0785 above 0.5. So delta x is 0.0785. So approximate e^0.5785 ≈ 1.6487 + 0.0785 * (0.1734/0.1) )= 1.6487 + 0.0785 * 1.734 → 1.6487 + (0.0785 * 1.734) → 0.0785 *1.734 ≈ 0.136. So e^0.5785 ≈ 1.6487 +0.136=1.7847.

So e^-0.5785 = 1/1.7847 ≈ 0.559. So 1- 0.559=0.441, so 44.1% chance. So that's about 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is 44%. So I think the correct answer is A) 44%. But wait, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%. So option A is 44%.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay law, which states that the probability of an atom decaying in a given time interval is independent of the time elapsed so far (memoryless property). The decay probability is modeled by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant and \( t \) is the time.

### Step 1: Determine the decay constant \( \lambda \)
From the problem, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using the decay formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the decay probability for the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the decay formula:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

Now, calculate \( e^{-0.57849} \). Using approximations or a calculator:

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.559
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.559 \approx 0.441 \, \text{or} \, 44.1\%.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The closest option to 44.1% is **44%**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

### Final Answer
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately **44%**.
