Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me go through the problem step by step.

The setup is that a researcher is creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They modified the gene to include a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance. However, when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of their construct. I need to look for possible issues in this sequence that would prevent proper protein expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm, a missense would change an amino acid, but would that prevent expression? Maybe not, unless it's in a critical region. But the problem is about overexpression, not function. So maybe not A.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon upstream. Let me look for any in frame stop codons before the actual stop. The sequence ends with ...TGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA. The last part is ...GAGTGA. GAG is glutamic acid, TGA is a stop codon. So the reading frame ends there. Wait, wait. The last part is ...GAGTGA. So the sequence ends with GAGTGA. So the stop codon (TGA) is at the end. So the ribosome would read from the start (ATG) and stop at TGA. So that seems correct.

But wait, the coding sequence starts with ATG, which is correct. Let me check if any in-frame stop codons appear before that. Let me count the triplets.

Looking through the sequence, I'll check for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the middle part: ...GCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Hmm, I see a "TGA" near the end. Wait, the last few codons before the stop are ...GCGTGA. So TGA is the 61st codon perhaps?

No, wait. Let me count from the start:

The sequence is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAA GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG GAA AGC AAG GGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGC TCT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC G TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me break it into triplets starting from ATG.

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAA GCC GCC AGG ACA CAG TTT CCG GAA AGC AAG GGC CAG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGC TCT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC G TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, I see a TGA at position ...ATG TGA... which is the start codon followed by TAC, which is Tyr. Wait, the first few codons are ATG (Met), TAC (Tyr), CCA (Pro), TAC (Tyr), GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), etc. Then in the middle, I see TGA as a codon. So TGA is a stop codon, right? So at around the middle of the sequence, there's a TGA. That would cause the ribosome to terminate early. Oh, that's a problem.

If the coding sequence has an in-frame TGA before the intended stop, the protein would be truncated there. So the construct would have a premature stop codon, leading to a shorter protein or no expression if the ribosome doesn't proceed past it.

So looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the coding sequence. If the plasmid construct has a TGA in the middle, that's a problem.

Wait, but the construct is designed to add the HA tag at the N-terminus. So perhaps the coding sequence starts with ATG followed by the HA sequence, then the GADD45G coding sequence.

But in the provided sequence, there's a TGA in frame. Let's see: the sequence is a plus strand, so the coding is from 5' to 3', which is the same as the mRNA. So the stop codon is in the middle, which would terminate translation early.

Therefore, the problem is that the construct has an in-frame TGA, causing the ribosome to stop before the intended end. So the GADD45G protein isn't being expressed because the translation stops early.

So looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early because of a stop codon. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. The sequence provided: looking for any TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at the middle: ...CTC CCT GAG AAG CTC AGC CTG TT TGC GAG GAG AGC CGA GCG TTA ACG ACT GGG TGC CCA GCA TCA TCC ATT TCG ACG CTT GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTA CGA GTC AGC CAA AGC TCT GAA CGT GGC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC G TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA...

Ah, here's a TGA. So that's a stop codon. So the construct has a TGA in the middle, which would terminate translation early.

Therefore, the issue is that the coding sequence contains an in-frame stop codon (TGA), causing the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely. So the protein isn't expressed as intended.

So the answer should be B) The ribosome terminated the translation early.


The problem involves determining why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. The researcher modified the GADD45G gene to include a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus and transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with the construct. Despite selecting for antibiotic resistance, the protein was not overexpressed. The provided DNA sequence of the plus strand of the construct was analyzed to identify the issue.

Key observations and reasoning:

1. **Analysis of the DNA sequence**: The sequence starts with the start codon `ATG` and ends with the stop codon `TGA`. However, during the sequence, an additional `TGA` (a stop codon) was found in the middle of the coding region. This in-frame stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein.

2. **Evaluation of options**:
   - **Option A**: A missense mutation in the antigenic determinant would not prevent expression but could affect protein function. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
   - **Option B**: A premature stop codon in the coding sequence would terminate translation early, preventing full-length protein expression. The presence of an in-frame `TGA` in the sequence supports this explanation.
   - **Option C**: The lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would not explain the absence of any protein expression.
   - **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for the `UAA` codon is irrelevant since the sequence ends with `TGA`, not `UAA`.

The most likely cause of the issue is the premature stop codon (`TGA`) in the middle of the coding sequence, which terminates translation early and prevents proper protein expression.

**Answer: B**
