Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, producing gas W and precipitate G. Then when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. There's also something about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. I need to figure out the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let me start by listing out what I know from the question.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X is probably a compound that has at least two different elements, one of which has an isotope that's heavier than the standard. For example, maybe something like H2O with deuterium (which is a heavier isotope of hydrogen).

Next, when X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. That sounds like a noble gas, but let's think. The same number of neutrons and protons would mean for an atom, but W is a molecule. Oh wait, maybe W is H2O or something else. Wait, no, the molecule's neutrons and protons are equal. Wait, the molecule as a whole must have equal numbers of neutrons and protons. Hmm. Alternatively, each atom in the molecule has equal neutrons and protons. Or maybe the molecule is, say, O2, which would have 8 protons each, but 8 neutrons each as well for O-16. But wait, O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so each O atom contributes to that. So if W is O2, then each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so each has same number. So the molecule's total would be 16 protons and 16 neutrons. But the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So maybe the molecule has same number, like 16 each. Wait, O2 has 16 protons (each O is 8, times 2) and 16 neutrons (each O has 8, times 2). So O2 as W? That could fit. But O2 is a diatomic gas, and a byproduct in some reactions.

Alternatively, maybe W is something else. Let me think: other diatomic gases. For example, N2? Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (for N-14), so the molecule would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That also fits. Or maybe CO2? No, that's a molecule with three atoms. Wait, the question says gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So the total in the molecule should have equal protons and neutrons. Alternatively, perhaps each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons. So like O2, where each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons in total, which meets the condition.

Then, when X reacts with Y, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Let's see, 277 K is approximately 4 degrees Celsius. Which solid has a melting point around there? Maybe ammonium chloride? Wait, no, that melts around 170°C. Or maybe something else. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm. What substances have a melting point near that? Maybe something like water ice, but that's 273 K. Wait, 277 is a bit higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a substance that is a solid just above 0°C. Wait, ammonium nitrate? No, that's around 169°C. Wait, maybe B is something like NaOH? No, NaOH is a solid that melts around 318°C. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Wait, 27
