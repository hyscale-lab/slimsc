Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take a deep breath and work through this step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving a different reaction. I need to figure out what products are formed in each case and then match them to the options provided.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an ether group: O connected to a methyl group (CH2O-), and the other side of the oxygen is a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be like this: the chain is butenyl (four carbons, double bond at position 2). So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Let me think. The 1-yl means the substituent is attached to the 1st carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)- as a substituent. Wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but with a substituent on the third carbon.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. But if it's 3-methyl, that would be a methyl group on the third carbon of the butenyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-. So attached to the oxygen, we have O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's break it down.

The substituent is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the main chain is four carbons, with a double bond starting at C2. So the substituent is attached to C1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. But wait, but-2-en-1-yl
