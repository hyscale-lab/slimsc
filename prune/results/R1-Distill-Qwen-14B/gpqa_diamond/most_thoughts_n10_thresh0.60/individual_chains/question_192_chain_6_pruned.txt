Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Okay, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, and it's smaller than R, so the conductor is surrounding the cavity. Now, they put a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. 

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm, I need to find the magnitude of E at point P. The options are A to D, each giving a different formula.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges inside them. Oh right, there's the concept of electrostatic shielding. When a charge is inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets an induced charge opposite to it, and the outer surface remains neutral if the conductor was initially uncharged.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor is uncharged. So when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have a charge of -q. But wait, that's when the conductor is conducting. Oh right, but wait, the conductor is a conductor, so charges can move freely. So the cavity is isolated, so the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have zero net charge because the conductor itself was uncharged. Wait, no, wait. Because the charge on the inner surface is -q, but the conductor's total charge was zero. So the outer surface must have +q. Wait, no, that's when the conductor is neutral, but the cavity has a charge. Let me think again.

No, wait. When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of equal magnitude but opposite sign. So for +q inside, the inner surface has -q. Then, since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance. So the conductor's total charge is
