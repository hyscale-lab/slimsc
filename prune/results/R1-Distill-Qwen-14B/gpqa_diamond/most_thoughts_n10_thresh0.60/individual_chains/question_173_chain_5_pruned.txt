Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about estimating the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron given its location uncertainty. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. 

Alright, the problem says the electron is traveling at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nanometers. Wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters, so Δx is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. 

The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. I think the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes I've seen it written without the ½ factor, but I think the minimum uncertainty is when the product is equal to ħ/2. 

So, first, I need to find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. From Δx * Δp = ħ/2, solving for Δp gives Δp = ħ/(2Δx). 

Wait, what's the value of ħ
