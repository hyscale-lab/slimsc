Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it. 

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given in meters, so probably involving length measurements.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

Gamma equals total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Oh right, because E = gamma * m₀c². Since we're given E as 27 GeV and m₀ is 3.41 GeV, then gamma is E / (m₀ c²). Wait, units-wise, since both are in GeV, the c² will cancel out the GeV if we think in terms of E = gamma m₀ c². But I might need to be careful with units, but maybe it's okay since we're dealing with ratios.

So gamma = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 7.91. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let me compute 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh, so 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. So gamma is about 7.91.

Now, the lifetime observed, τ, is gamma * τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.91 *8= about 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s. So τ ≈6.328e-15 seconds. Wait, no: 7.91 *8 is 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s is 6.328e-15 s? Wait, wait, 63e-16 is 6.3e-15. Oh wait, 8e-16 multiplied by 7.91 is 7.91 *8 =63.28, so 63.28e-16 s = 6.328e-15 seconds. Yeah.

So the lifetime of the particle in the lab frame is about 6.3e-15 seconds. Now, the particles will travel some distance before decaying. The distance is velocity multiplied by time. Velocity v is related to gamma. Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v can be found from gamma.

But maybe a simpler approach is to compute the speed beta, which is v/c. Since gamma is 7.91, beta can be found using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So solving for beta:

gamma^2 = 1/(1 - beta²)
beta² = 1 - 1/gamma^2
So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(7.91)^2)

Let me compute 7.91 squared. 7.91^2 is approximately 62.5681. So 1/62.5681 ≈ 0.016. So 1 -0.016 is 0.984. Take square root: sqrt(0.984) is approximately 0.992. So beta ≈ 0.992 c. So the particle is moving at about 0.992 times the speed of light.

Wait, but how precise do I need to be here? Maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let's see:

gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ exactly 7.91495.

So gamma squared is (7.91495)^2 ≈ let's compute 7.91^2.

7.91^2 = (7 + 0.91)^2 = 7² + 2*7*0.91 + 0.91² = 49 + 12.74 + 0.8281 = 49+12.74=61.74, 61.74 +0.8281=62.5681. So yeah, gamma squared is about 62.5681.

So beta squared is 1 - 1/62.5681 ≈ 1 - 0.016, as before. So beta squared is 0.984. So beta is sqrt(0.984) ≈ 0.992.

So v=0.992c.

Now, the distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * tau.

Tau is the lifetime in lab frame, which is gamma * tau0 =6.328e-15 s.

So L = 0.992c *6.328e-15 s.

Wait, the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. Hmm, so let's compute that.

0.992 * 3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.328e-15 s: 2.976e8 *6.328e-15 = let me compute this.

2.976e8 *6.328e-15 = (2.976 *6.328) * 1e8-15 = (about 18.8) *1e-7 = 1.88e-6 meters. Wait, wait. Let me compute 2.976 *6.328.

2.976 *6 =17.856, 2.976 *0.328≈ 0.978. So total ≈17.856 +0.978=18.834.

So 18.834e-7 meters is 1.8834e-6 meters, which is 1.88 micrometers.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think the idea is that in order to detect the decay, the particles must travel a certain distance, and the detector's resolution must be good enough to see the decay vertices. So the minimum resolution is the distance they travel before decaying, such that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, so perhaps we need to consider the proper formula for the probability of a decay being observed. The probability that a particle decays within a certain time is given by 1 - exp(-t/tau). But wait, the question is about the fraction of decays observed. If the particle's lifetime is tau, then the decay length is L= beta gamma c tau0. Hmm, but in this case, the decay length is L = gamma beta c tau0, which is the distance the particle travels before decaying on average.

But wait, our calculation of L is 1.88e-6 meters, which is 1.88 micrometers. So if the detector can resolve this length, then we can see the decay. But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, so perhaps we're looking for the decay length L such that the probability of the decay occurring within that length is 30%. So the formula for the probability is P = 1 - exp(-L/(L_0)), where L_0 is the average decay length (which is beta gamma c tau0, the same as L in this case). 

Wait, but that's the mean lifetime. If the average decay length is L_0, then the probability that the particle decays within a distance L is 1 - exp(-L/(L_0)).

Wait, no, actually, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability of decay before a certain time is 1 - exp(-t/tau). But since in our case, L = v t = beta gamma c tau0 * t/tau0? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau0)), because the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau0, so the decay probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau0)).

Wait, no, the decay probability is 1 - exp(-t/(tau)).

Wait, but the average lifetime is tau in the lab frame. So the mean lifetime is tau. So the probability of decay before time t is 1 - exp(-t/tau). So if we set t such that L = v t, then P = 1 - exp(- L/(beta gamma c tau0)).

Wait, perhaps I should express it in terms of the decay length. The mean decay length is L0 = beta gamma c tau0. So the probability that the decay occurs within a length x is P = 1 - exp(-x/L0).

We want P >= 0.3, so 1 - exp(-x/L0) >= 0.3. Solving for x:

exp(-x/L0) <= 0.7

Take natural logarithm: -x/L0 <= ln(0.7)

Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):

x/L0 >= ln(1/0.7) ≈ ln(1.4286) ≈ 0.3567.

So x >= L0 * 0.3567.

Thus, the minimum resolution needed is x = L0 * 0.3567.

Wait, but wait, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So I think the idea is that the detector must have a resolution (i.e., a precision in measuring the decay point) better than the decay length. So if the decay length is L, then the detector must resolve it to see the decay. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the detector must have a spatial resolution such that it can distinguish the decay point with a precision better than the decay length, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point, i.e., the smallest distance that the decay can be displaced, so that at least 30% of the decays are observed within that distance. So the 30% comes from the probability that the particle decays within a certain length, which is the detector's resolution.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to find the minimum x such that P(x) = 0.3, and then the resolution must be at least x.

So using the formula P = 1 - exp(-x/L0) = 0.3.

So solving for x: x = -L0 ln(1 - 0.3) = -L0 ln(0.7).

Which is x = L0 * 0.3567 (since ln(0.7) ≈ -0.3567, so negative of that is 0.3567).

So x ≈ L0 * 0.3567.

Earlier, we found L0 ≈ 1.88e-6 meters. So x ≈ 1.88e-6 m * 0.3567 ≈ 0.67e-6 m, which is 6.7e-7 m or 0.67 micrometers.

Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option B) 2.08e-9 m, which is 2.08 nanometers. That's way smaller than what I calculated. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating L0. Let me recalculate L0.

Wait, the calculation was L0 = gamma * beta * c * tau0.

Wait, gamma is 27 / 3.41 ≈7.91.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.91)^2)).

Compute 7.91 squared again. 7.91^2 is 62.5681. So 1/62.5681 = ~0.016, so 1-0.016 = 0.984. So beta= sqrt(0.984) ≈0.992. So beta~0.992.

So L0 = gamma * beta * c * tau0.

tau0 is 8e-16 s.

So gamma * beta =7.91 *0.992 ≈7.86.

So 7.86 * c *8e-16 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So 7.86 *3e8 *8e-16 = 7.86 *24e-8 = let's compute 7.86 *24 = 188.64. So 188.64e-8 m is 1.8864e-6 m, which is 1.8864 micrometers. So L0 ≈1.886e-6 meters.

Wait, so x is 0.3567 * L0 ≈ 0.3567*1.886e-6 = let's calculate that.

1.886e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ 0.671e-6 meters, or 6.71e-7 meters. Hmm, 0.67 micrometers.

But the options don't have anything near that. Let me look again.

Options:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)

B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)

C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)

D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Hmm, none of these match 6.7e-7 m. So perhaps I made a wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The question says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." Maybe it's the minimum distance that the particle travels so that at least 30% of the particles decay within that distance. So the minimum x is such that P(x) = 0.3.

So according to earlier, x ≈0.3567 * L0. With L0=1.886e-6 m, x=0.3567 *1.886e-6 ≈6.71e-7 m, which is 0.67 micrometers. But none of the options match. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the resolution refers to the proper mean lifetime, but no, the tau0 is given. Or perhaps the calculation is about the relativistic gamma factor.

Wait, maybe I should compute the velocity in terms of c more accurately. Let me compute beta more precisely.

Gamma is 27/(3.41) = approximately 7.915 (since 3.41 *7=23.87, 3.41*7.915= 27.000 (since 3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*0.915=3.118, so total 26.988, which is close to 27. So 7.915 is correct.

So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma^2=7.915^2. Let me compute 7.9^2 = 62.41, 0.015^2 = 0.000225, 2*7.9*0.015=0.237. So (7.915)^2= (7.9 +0.015)^2= 7.9² + 2*(7.9)*(0.015) + 0.015²=62.41 + 0.237 + 0.000225=62.647225.

So 1/(gamma^2)=1/62.647225≈0.01596.

So 1 - 0.01596=0.98404. sqrt(0.98404) is approximately 0.992.

But more precisely, sqrt(0.98404) is let's compute:

0.992^2= (0.99 +0.002)^2= 0.99^2 + 2*(0.99)(0.002) +0.002^2=0.9801 + 0.00396 +0.000004=0.984064.

Which is very close to 0.98404. So beta is approximately 0.992.

So back to L0, which is gamma * beta * c * tau0.

c=3e8 m/s.

So L0=7.915 * 0.992 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Calculate it step by step:

7.915 *0.992 ≈7.86.

7.86 *3e8 = 2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16 =2.358e9 *8e-16 = 2.358 *8 e-7 = 18.864e-7 =1.8864e-6 m.

So L0 is approximately 1.8864e-6 m.

So x=0.3567 * 1.8864e-6 m ≈6.71e-7 m.

But the options don't have this. So maybe the question is referring to the proper lifetime's effect, or perhaps the question is considering only the gamma factor and not beta.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula used is decay length L = gamma * c * tau0.

Wait, because sometimes people use L = gamma * beta c tau0. Oh wait, I included beta earlier, but perhaps some people forget beta.

Wait, if I calculate L without beta, i.e., L = gamma * c * tau0.

Gamma is 7.915, c=3e8 m/s, tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.915 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.915 *3=23.745, 23.745*8=189.96, so 189.96e-8 m = 1.8996e-6 m, same as before, since beta is close to 1, so including it or not doesn't change much.

But the result is the same.

Wait, maybe the question is not considering the 30% and just wants the decay length in the lab frame. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, looking at the options again, the first option is 2.08e-6 m, which is about the same as our L0 (~1.88e-6 m). But our calculation is about 1.88e-6 m, which is 1.88 micrometers. The option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers, close to our calculation but a bit higher. How?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recompute L0.

Wait, gamma is 27 GeV /3.41 GeV = approximately 7.915.

So gamma =7.915.

Beta is sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma^2))= sqrt(1 - (1/62.647)) = sqrt(0.98404) ≈0.992.

So gamma*beta =7.915 *0.992≈7.86.

So L0=gamma * beta * c * tau0.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So L0=7.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.86 *3=23.58.

23.58 *8=188.64.

So 188.64e-8 m = 1.8864e-6 m =1.8864 micrometers.

Hmm, more precisely, 1.8864e-6 m.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m. So that's about 10% higher.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is using gamma as 8, not 7.915. Let me try that.

If gamma is 8 exactly, then gamma squared is 64.

Beta squared is 1 -1/64 = 63/64 ≈0.984375.

Beta is sqrt(0.984375)=approx 0.9921567.

So gamma * beta =8 *0.9921567≈7.937.

L0=7.937 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.937 *3=23.811.

23.811 *8=190.488.

So 190.488e-8 m =1.90488e-6 m ≈1.905e-6 m.

Still, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 1.905 *1.09... so perhaps the numbers are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is beta gamma c tau0? No, that's not the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is incorrect because the energy is given as 27 GeV, which is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Wait, that's a crucial point!

Ah, wait a second! The problem states that the energy is 27 GeV. Is that the total energy or the kinetic energy? Because that changes things.

In particle physics, usually, when someone says the energy, it's the total energy, including rest mass. But sometimes, it could be kinetic. The problem says "Energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Hmm, probably it's the total energy, since in particle physics, energy usually refers to total unless stated otherwise.

But wait, in the rest frame of the particle, its energy is m c². So if the energy in the lab frame is 27 GeV, and the rest mass is 3.41 GeV, then E = gamma m c².

So our earlier calculation was correct, gamma =27 /3.41 =7.915.

But if E were the kinetic energy, then E = (gamma -1) m c².

So if E=27 GeV, then gamma = (27 /3.41) +1 ≈ (7.915) +1 =8.915.

Wait, that would change the gamma.

So this could be the source of my mistake. Let me explore this possibility.

If E=27 GeV is the kinetic energy, then:

gamma = (E_kinetic)/(m c²) +1 = (27)/(3.41) +1 ≈7.915 +1=8.915.

So gamma is approximately 8.915.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2= (8.915)^2.

8.915^2:

Compute 8^2=64.

0.915^2=0.837.

2*8*0.915=14.64.

So 64 +14.64 +0.837=79.477.

So gamma squared is approximately 79.477.

So 1/gamma² ≈0.01257.

1 - 0.01257=0.98743.

Beta = sqrt(0.98743)=about 0.9937.

So gamma * beta =8.915 *0.9937≈8.861.

L0= gamma * beta * c * tau0.

So 8.861 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

8.861 *3=26.583.

26.583 *8=212.664.

So 212.664e-8 m=2.12664e-6 m, which is approximately 2.13e-6 m, or 2.13 micrometers.

That's closer to option A, which is 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. So that's why the option A is correct.

But the question says the energy is 27 GeV. Hmm, the problem says "Energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV." Well, in particle physics, energy of a particle is usually the total energy, but perhaps in this problem, it's the kinetic energy.

But since when I assumed E is the kinetic energy, the calculation gives 2.13e-6 m, which is very close to option A (2.08e-6 m). So perhaps that's the intended approach.

But why is the question's proper lifetime given as τ₀=8e-16 s? Well, proper lifetime is measured in the rest frame, so that's correct.

So if the answer is option A, which is 2.08e-6 m, let me check the calculation again with the assumption that E is kinetic.

E_kinetic=27 GeV.

So gamma = (E_kinetic)/(m c²) +1.

m c²=3.41 GeV.

So gamma = (27)/(3.41) +1=7.915 +1=8.915.

Beta=sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))).

gamma=8.915.

gamma^2=79.47.

So beta= sqrt(1-1/79.47) = sqrt(78.47/79.47)=sqrt(0.987)≈0.9935.

So beta ≈0.9935.

L0= gamma * beta * c * tau0.

gamma * beta=8.915 *0.9935=approx 8.857.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So L0=8.857 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 8.857 *3=26.571.

26.571 *8=212.568.

So 212.568e-8 m=2.12568e-6 m≈2.126e-6 m.

Which is about 2.13 micrometers. So the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is very close.

Hmm, it's possible that in the problem, the energy is the total energy, but then why the answer is 2.08e-6 m, which is option A.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done more accurately.

Wait, let's recalculate with gamma=8.915 exactly.

gamma=8.915.

gamma^2= (8.915)^2= let's calculate precisely.

8 *8=64.

8 *0.915=7.32.

0.915 *8=7.32.

0.915 *0.915=0.837225.

Wait, no, (a +b)^2= a² +2ab +b².

8.915=8 +0.915.

So (8.915)^2=8^2 +2*(8)(0.915) +0.915^2=64 + 14.64 + 0.837225=64+14.64=78.64; 78.64 +0.837225=79.477225.

So gamma^2=79.477225.

So beta= sqrt(1 - 1/79.477225)=sqrt(78.477225/79.477225)=sqrt(0.9871)= approximately 0.99353.

So beta=0.99353.

So gamma * beta=8.915 *0.99353≈8.86.

So L0=8.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

=8.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

8.86 *3=26.58.

26.58 *8=212.64.

So L0=212.64e-8 m=2.1264e-6 m=2.1264 micrometers.

Still, option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, perhaps the question uses 27 GeV as the total energy.

Wait, let me try the first approach with E as total energy.

So E=27 GeV.

gamma=27/3.41=7.915.

So beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(7.915)^2)).

7.915^2=62.647.

So beta= sqrt(0.98404)=0.992.

gamma*beta=7.915 *0.992≈7.86.

L0=7.86 *3e8 *8e-16.

=7.86 *3=23.58.

23.58 *8=188.64.

L0=188.64e-8 m=1.8864e-6 m=1.8864 micrometers.

Which is 1.8864e-6 m. But option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, so perhaps the question expects me to compute without considering the beta factor, which is incorrect, but perhaps that's the reason.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the decay length is L=gamma c tau0.

So L=gamma *c * tau0.

gamma=7.915.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.915 *3e8 *8e-16.

=7.915 *24e-8= let's compute 7.915 *24=190 approx.

Wait, 24 *7=168, 24 *0.915=21.96. So 168+21.96=189.96.

So 189.96e-8 m=1.8996e-6 m≈1.9e-6 m.

But again, option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution being the length the particle travels before decaying, so L=gamma beta c tau0, which is 1.886e-6 m, but none of the options are that.

Wait, the options include option A as 2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 1.09 times our 1.886e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact numbers.

Wait, let's compute gamma * beta * c * tau0.

gamma=27/(3.41)=7.91495.

beta= sqrt(1-1/(gamma^2))= sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

Wait, 3.41^2=11.6281; 27^2=729.

So (11.6281)/(729)=0.01596.

So 1-0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.99201.

So beta=0.99201.

gamma*beta=7.91495 *0.99201.

7.91495 *0.99201= approximately 7.86.

So L0=7.86 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

7.86 *3e8 =2.358e9.

2.358e9 *8e-16=1.8864e-6 m.

So L0=1.8864e-6 m.

Hmm, and if we calculate 0.3567 * L0 for 30% probability, we get 0.3567 *1.8864e-6= approximately 6.71e-7 m.

But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the question is asking for the average decay length, not the distance for 30% probability.

Wait, the question says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps it's the length that allows the decay to be observed, i.e., the detector must have a resolution better than the decay length.

But the average decay length is about 1.88e-6 m, so the minimum resolution would be this value. But option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses gamma as 8. So let me compute with gamma=8.

gamma=8.

beta= sqrt(1 - (1/64))=sqrt(63/64)=sqrt(0.984375)=0.9921567.

gamma*beta=8 *0.9921567=7.93725.

So L0=7.93725 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.93725 *3=23.81175.

23.81175 *8=190.494.

So 190.494e-8 m=1.90494e-6 m=1.905e-6 m.

Still, that's about 1.9 micrometers, which is close to option A (2.08e-6 m), but not exactly.

Hmm, perhaps the question has a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the velocity as beta c without multiplying by gamma. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the relativistic expression for velocity, but not calculating beta correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy given is the kinetic, but the problem says energy is 27 GeV. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in natural units where c=1 and other constants are set to 1, but no, the options are in meters, so units must be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the proper lifetime, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about time dilation and the mean path.

Another approach: the proper lifetime is tau0=8e-16 s. The lifetime observed is tau=gamma tau0, so the time the particle lives in the lab is longer.

The distance the particle travels is L=beta c tau.

So L=beta c gamma tau0.

But beta c gamma = gamma beta c.

Which, as before, is gamma beta c.

Wait, so L=gamma beta c tau0.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

Hmm, perhaps the question is not considering the 30% probability and just asks for the average decay length, but even then, the options don't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the velocity being non-relativistic, which I doubt given the energies involved.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another formula I remember is that the mean decay length is c tau gamma beta. Which is the same as what we've done.

Hmm, another angle: the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So perhaps the detector's spatial resolution must be such that at least 30% of the decays are within that resolution. So the resolution must be at least x such that the probability of the decay occurring within x is 30%.

Which brings me back to P=0.3=1 -exp(-x/(gamma beta c tau0)).

So x= (gamma beta c tau0) * ln(1/(1-0.3))= gamma beta c tau0 *ln(1/0.7)≈gamma beta c tau0 *0.3567.

So that would make x≈ (gamma beta c tau0) *0.3567.

Given that, with gamma beta c tau0=1.886e-6 m, x≈0.671e-6 m=6.71e-7 m=0.671 micrometers.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute without the 30% factor, and the answer is the decay length, which is approximately 1.88e-6 m. But option A is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the calculation uses beta exactly as 0.992, but with more precise gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma=27/3.41 exactly.

27 divided by 3.41.

3.41 *7=23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41≈0.917.

So gamma=7.917.

So gamma=7.917.

beta= sqrt(1 -1/(7.917)^2).

7.917^2=62.67.

So 1/62.67≈0.01596.

1-0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)= approx 0.992.

So gamma*beta=7.917*0.992≈7.863.

L0=7.863 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.863 *3=23.589.

23.589 *8=188.712.

188.712e-8 m=1.88712e-6 m≈1.887e-6 m.

So it's about 1.887 micrometers.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the speed of light as exactly 3e8 m/s, but perhaps the exact calculation would change things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using exact values.

Let me recompute gamma more precisely.

gamma=27 /3.41.

3.41=341/100=3.41.

27/3.41=2700/341 ≈7.9149557.

So gamma=7.9149557.

Thus, beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2)))= sqrt(1 - (1/(7.9149557)^2 )).

Compute 7.9149557^2.

Compute 7.9149557 *7.9149557.

Let me compute it accurately.

7 *7 =49.

7 *0.9149557=6.40469.

0.9149557 *7=6.40469.

0.9149557 *0.9149557= approx 0.837.

Wait, perhaps another method: 7.9149557^2= (8 - 0.0850443)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.0850443 + (0.0850443)^2.

=64 -1.3607088 +0.0072329.

=64 -1.3607088=62.6392912 +0.0072329=62.6465241.

So gamma squared=62.6465241.

So 1/gamma squared=1/62.6465241≈0.01596.

1 -0.01596=0.98404.

sqrt(0.98404)=0.99201.

So beta=0.99201.

gamma*beta=7.9149557 * 0.99201 ≈7.863.

So L0=7.863 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-8.

7.863 *2.4e-8=?

7.863 *2.4=18.8712.

So 18.8712e-8 m=1.88712e-6 m.

So 1.88712e-6 m is 1.887e-6 m. Still, the closest option is A:2.08e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere, but I can't think where.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed as a fraction of c in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to be at least the decay length, not considering the 30%. So perhaps the question is not about 30% but about the resolution being equal to the decay length.

But that's not what the question says. It says to observe at least 30% of the decays, which implies a certain probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the 30% is the fraction of the lifetime, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is using the momentum of the particle, p=gamma m v, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the minimum velocity. No, that's unrelated.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done in natural units, but that would not give the answer in meters.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm including both gamma and beta, but the proper formula for the decay length is L=gamma c tau0, without beta.

Which would make L=7.915 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

So 7.915 *3e8=2.3745e9.

2.3745e9 *8e-16=1.8996e-6 m=1.8996e-6 m.

Which is about 1.9e-6 m. So 1.9 micrometers.

But the option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 10% higher.

Hmm, perhaps in the problem the calculation uses gamma=8. So let me compute with gamma=8.

gamma=8.

beta= sqrt(1 -1/(64))=sqrt(63/64)=sqrt(0.984375)=0.9921567.

gamma*beta=8 *0.9921567=7.93725.

L=7.93725 *3e8 *8e-16.

7.93725 *3=23.81175.

23.81175 *8=190.494.

190.494e-8 m=1.90494e-6 m=1.905e-6 m.

So, 1.905e-6 m, which is 1.905 micrometers.

Option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 9% higher.

Hmm, but I don't see any other way to get to 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the proper lifetime is 8e-16 seconds, but in the lab frame, it's gamma times that, which is 7.915 *8e-16=6.332e-15 seconds.

The distance is v * tau_lab = beta c * gamma tau0.

Which brings us back to the same calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with exact numbers.

gamma = 27 /3.41 = 7.9149557.

beta= sqrt(1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2)).

3.41^2= 11.6281.

27^2=729.

So 11.6281/729=0.01596.

So beta= sqrt(1 - 0.01596)=sqrt(0.98404)=0.99201.

So L0= gamma * beta * c * tau0.

=7.9149557 *0.99201 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

=7.9149557 *0.99201=7.863.

7.863 *3e8=2.3589e9.

2.3589e9 *8e-16=1.887e-6 m.

So L0=1.887e-6 m=1.887 micrometers.

No option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays", which would imply that the resolution is the value x where P=0.3.

Which would be x= L0 * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L0 * 0.3567.

So 1.887e-6 *0.3567≈6.71e-7 m, which is 0.67 micrometers. But again, no option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the decay length, not considering the 30% probability. So the minimal resolution is the decay length, which is approximately 1.88e-6 m. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the entire approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the velocity in terms of tau and the energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the time is tau=gamma tau0, and the distance is v * tau= beta c gamma tau0.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the distance but the time resolution required, but the question says 'minimum resolution' which is a distance, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the particle's speed, but I don't see how that would relate to the resolution.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done without including beta.

If I compute L=gamma * c * tau0.

gamma=7.915.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.915 *3e8 *8e-16=7.915 *24e-8= 7.915 *24=190.

Wait, 7.915 *24= (7*24)=168, 0.915 *24=21.96, total 189.96.

So 189.96e-8 m=1.8996e-6 m≈1.9e-6 m.

Which is about 1.9 micrometers. But again, none of the options match except option A:2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps the energy is in the lab frame as 27 GeV, which includes the rest mass. So E=gamma m c²=27 GeV.

So gamma=27/3.41=7.915.

So L=gamma beta c tau0=7.915 *0.992 *3e8 *8e-16.

Same as before. So 1.88e-6 m.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using units where c=1. But the options are in meters, so c must be considered.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate with exact values using more precise intermediate steps.

gamma=27/3.41=7.914955765.

beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(7.914955765)^2 )).

Compute 7.914955765^2.

Using a calculator, (7.914955765)^2 = approx 62.64652.

So 1-1/62.64652=61.64652/62.64652≈0.98361.

Wait, wait, 62.64652 is gamma^2.

So 1/(gamma^2)=1/62.64652=0.015963.

So 1 -0.015963=0.984037.

Beta= sqrt(0.984037)=0.992008.

So gamma * beta=7.914955765 *0.992008≈7.863.

So L0=7.863 *3e8 *8e-16=7.863 *2.4e-8=18.8712e-8=1.887e-6 m.

Still, the same result.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I can't reach it with the given data. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the minimum velocity. No, the question is about resolution, which is a distance.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the velocity as v= (E/(m c^2))^2 ?

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the relation between energy and momentum, but I don't see the connection.

Wait, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p= sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2)/c.

E=27 GeV, m c^2=3.41 GeV.

So p= sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2 ) GeV/c.

Compute 27^2=729, 3.41^2=11.6281. So 729-11.6281=717.3719.

p= sqrt(717.3719) GeV/c≈26.785 GeV/c.

Then, momentum p=gamma m v.

p= gamma m v.

So v= p c/(gamma m).

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, gamma=27/3.41=7.915.

So v= (p c)/(gamma m c^2/(c^2 )).

Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity can be found as v= (pc^2)/(E).

Because p=E v/(c^2).

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here.

Hmm, considering the time I've spent and the options given, I think the intended answer is option A, 2.08e-6 m. Perhaps the calculation in the problem assumes that the energy is the kinetic energy, which gives a higher gamma, leading to a longer decay length.

But with the information given, I think the correct approach is to compute the decay length as gamma * beta * c * tau0, which gives about 1.88e-6 m, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, although my calculations don't fully align with it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects only gamma to be considered, not beta, which would give L0=gamma *c * tau0=7.915 *3e8 *8e-16=7.915 *24e-8=189.96e-8=1.8996e-6 m, which is close to option A.

Wait, option A is 2.08e-6 m. If 2.08 is (7.915 *2.625)= approx 20.8e-6, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses gamma=8. So L0=8 *3e8 *8e-16= 192e-8=1.92e-6 m, which is 1.92 micrometers. Close to option A.

But I'm not certain. Given that, I think the intended answer is option A:2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \), we analyze the decay process and calculate the decay length in the lab frame. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and the energy of the particle in the Bubble Chamber is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \), with a rest mass \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.915
   \]

2. **Determine the velocity factor (\( \beta \)):**
   Using the relation \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \):
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.915^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.01596} \approx 0.992
   \]

3. **Decay length in the lab frame (\( L_0 \)):**
   The decay length is given by:
   \[
   L_0 = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma \approx 7.915 \), \( \beta \approx 0.992 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   L_0 = 7.915 \times 0.992 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 8 \times 10^{-16}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   L_0 \approx 1.887 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \, (1.887 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]

4. **Minimum resolution for 30% of decays:**
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, the minimum resolution corresponds to the distance \( x \) where the probability of decay is \( P = 0.3 \). Using the formula:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-x / L_0}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = L_0 \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right) = L_0 \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.7}\right) \approx L_0 \times 0.3567
   \]
   Substituting \( L_0 \approx 1.887 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   x \approx 1.887 \times 10^{-6} \times 0.3567 \approx 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \, (0.671 \, \mu\text{m})
   \]

5. **Comparison with options:**
   The calculated decay length \( L_0 \approx 1.887 \, \mu\text{m} \) and the minimum resolution \( x \approx 0.671 \, \mu\text{m} \) do not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **A) \( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)**, which is approximately \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \). This discrepancy may arise from rounding differences or assumptions in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
Based on the calculations and the provided options, the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is best approximated by **Option A**.

Answer: A
