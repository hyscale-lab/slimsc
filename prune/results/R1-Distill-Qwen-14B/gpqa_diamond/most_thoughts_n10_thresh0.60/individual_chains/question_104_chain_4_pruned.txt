Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits. The question is about comparing the orbital periods of the two planets based on the radial velocity shifts measured.

Wait, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the star's velocity towards or away from us. So a larger shift would mean the star is moving more, which probably relates to the planet's mass and orbital characteristics.

The problem states that Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. So, the question is, how does the orbital period of Planet #2 compare to Planet #1? The options are various times longer or shorter.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is proportional to ( (M_p * sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) * (1/(1 - e²))^(1/2) ), but since the planets are similar to Neptune and the stars are like the Sun, M_p << M_*, so that term simplifies. Also, e is zero because the orbits are circular, so that term becomes 1. So K is approximately proportional to M_p^(1/3) divided by something related to the star's mass and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (2π G) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 day)) )^(1/3) ) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should recall the radial velocity formula. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (v) ) where v is the star's velocity.

The formula is:

K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (P) ))^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look up the exact form. Alternatively, the formula I think is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 - e²)) ) * (2π / P) ) ]^(1/3) * [c / (2π)] 

Wait, I might be mixing up some terms. Alternatively, a more straightforward approach is to use the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

Wait, I think the formula for K is:

K = [ ( (G * P) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ] * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since e=0, and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G / (2π c³) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the proportionality. Since M_p is the same for both planets (since both are similar to Neptune), and the stars have the same mass, we can consider that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because K ∝ (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = (P2 / P1 )^(-1/3) * K2 ?

Wait, let's think again. Since K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3}), then K1 = (1/P1^(1/3)) * const, K2 = (1/P2^(1/3)) * const. So, K1 / K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, rearranging, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 mA, K2 is
