Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question says there are five exoplanets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were found using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not sure how that affects this problem. Oh wait, the key stuff is that they're in orbital resonance and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet's period is longer according to that ratio.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, which I remember is the measure of how much light a planet reflects. Since their albedos are the same, that should simplify the calculation because albedo doesn't affect the ratio.

Equilibrium temperature, as I recall, depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

Oh right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)). Because the planet absorbs energy from the star, which is proportional to R^2/(a^2) from the inverse square law, and then the planet radiates as a blackbody, so the energy out is proportional to T^4. So setting them equal gives R^2/(a^2) = (4πσ/(σ)) * (T^4/(T_star^4)) * (R_star^2/(a^2)), but maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, a more straightforward formula might be T = T_star * (R/(2a))^(1/2). Or perhaps another way to write it is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), but I'm a bit uncertain about the exact formula.

Wait, let me get this right. The equilibrium temperature is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The flux received by the planet is F = L/(4πa²), where L is the star's luminosity. The planet reflects some of it (based on albedo) and absorbs the rest. Assuming the
