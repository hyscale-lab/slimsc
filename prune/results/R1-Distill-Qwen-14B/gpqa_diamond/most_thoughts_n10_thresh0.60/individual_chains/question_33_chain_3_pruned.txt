Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions are all about forming rings by combining two molecules. The [4+2] part suggests it's a Diels-Alder reaction, right? Because Diels-Alder is a [4π + 2π] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile.

The reactants given are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. I need to find the exo product from the options provided.

First, I should draw out the structures of the reactants to visualize the reaction. 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a five-membered aromatic ring with sulfur, and it has methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Furan-2,5-dione is another five-membered ring with two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So, furan-2,5-dione is like a cyclic dione, which makes it a good dienophile for a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene is usually the conjugated diene, and the dienophile is the molecule with a double bond that can react. So which one is the diene here? The 2,5-dimethylthiophene is aromatic and fully conjugated, so maybe it's acting as the diene. Or is it the other way around? Furan-2,5-dione has a conjugated system too, but it's more likely to be the dienophile because it has electron-withdrawing groups (the ketones) which activate it for the reaction.

So, the diene must be 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Wait, no, thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. It's an aromatic compound, so maybe it's not the diene. Because Diels-Alder requires a conjugated diene, which is usually not aromatic? Or wait, sometimes thiophene can act as a diene in certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile, and the thiophene is the diene.

Wait, another thought: 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a five-membered ring, which
