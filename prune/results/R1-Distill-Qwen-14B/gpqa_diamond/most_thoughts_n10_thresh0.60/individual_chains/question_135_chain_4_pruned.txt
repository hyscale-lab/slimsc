Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question is about a bosonic field X which interacts with fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. So here, X is a boson, and it's interacting with some fermions. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A to D, each listing different possible decay products.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the decay products must have enough energy, right? So the mass of X has to be at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into. Because in particle physics, for a particle to decay into two particles, their combined mass can't exceed the mass of the original particle.

So first, I need to figure out which fermions are being interacted with by X. Looking at the Lagrangian, it's written as λf f̄ (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that. The term looks like λf f̄ X ψ_f. So X is coupling to fermions, right? So X can decay into pairs of fermions.

But what fermions are available? The fermions are ψ_f. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is with a fermion field ψ_f, which could be any fermion, like quarks or leptons.

Wait, in the Lagrangian, I think the structure is something like f times X times ψ_f. Or maybe it's the Yukawa interaction term. So the interaction term is something like λ f f̄ X ψ_f? Or perhaps it's a Yukawa coupling where X is a scalar field coupling to a fermion-antifermion pair.

Wait, perhaps the term is λ f f̄ X ψ_f. Hmm, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's more like λ ψ_f̄ X ψ_f, which would make sense for
