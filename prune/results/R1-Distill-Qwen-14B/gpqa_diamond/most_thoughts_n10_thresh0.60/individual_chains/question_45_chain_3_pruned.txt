Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try my best.

The question says there are four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²). Oh wait, yeah, the problem actually defines E as pi² ħ² / (2mL²). So each E is basically (n²) multiplied by that constant. So each E_n is n² * E, right? Because E in this problem is the base unit when n=1.

So for a single particle, n=1 would be E, n=2 would be 4E, n=3 is 9E, etc.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they are fermions, right? Because spin-1/2 particles obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So, in the same potential well, each quantum state can hold only one fermion. But wait, in 1D, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin state. Oh wait, in 1D, each energy level is
