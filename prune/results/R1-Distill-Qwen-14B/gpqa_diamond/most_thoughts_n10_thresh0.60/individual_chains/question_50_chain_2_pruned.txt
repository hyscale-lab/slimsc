Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram my colleague was working on. The note next to the diagram has this expression: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Hmm, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram affects the dimensionality and the factors that come into play when calculating the amplitude.

Wait, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of something like 1/(16 pi^2) from the integral in four-dimensional spacetime. But wait, more accurately, each loop typically brings in a factor of (4pi)^{d/2} where d is the spacetime dimensions. But since this is four dimensions, each loop would give a (4pi)^2 factor from the integral. But sometimes, especially in dimensional regularization, the exact factors can vary, but I think for the purpose of this problem, the main thing is to count the number of loops by looking at the dependence on pi.

Looking at the given expression, the denominator has (4pi)^6. So (4pi)^6 is in the denominator. How does that relate to the number of loops? Each loop contributes a (4pi)^2 factor because when you do loop integrals in four dimensions, each loop has a 1/(4pi)^{d/2} factor, where d=4. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of Feynman parameters and the typical loop integral. 

Wait, a loop integral in 4D
