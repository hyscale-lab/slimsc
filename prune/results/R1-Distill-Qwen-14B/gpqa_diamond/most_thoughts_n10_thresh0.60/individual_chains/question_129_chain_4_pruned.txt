Okay, so I need to figure out which compound E is in this reaction scheme. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it through.

So the starting point is compound A. When A reacts with HCN, it produces compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to give E.

The problem also gives some hints. Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with a phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Oh wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So A must be an aldehyde or ketone because the Wittig reaction usually involves those.

Looking at the product of the Wittig reaction, the structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group comes from the ylide, which must have been a substituted phosphorus reagent. Wait, the Wittig reaction replaces an oxygen (from the aldehyde or ketone) with a CH2 group from the ylide. So the product's structure suggests that the starting compound A would have had a carbonyl group in a certain position.

Let me draw this in my mind. The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The propan-2-ylidene group is a CH2-C(CH3)2 group attached to the cyclopentane. So the structure is cyclopentane with two methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and a propenylidene group at position 4. Wait, the substituents are 1 and 2 methyl, and at 4, the propylidene which is like a CH2-C(CH3)2 attached via a double bond? Or is it a substituent?

Wait, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, maybe. So the cyclopentane has a double bond connected to the substituent. So that would suggest that the Wittig reaction added a new group to A.

Oh wait, the
