Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. 

So, the reaction steps are:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four different cyclo ketones. I need to figure out which one is E.

Let me start by recalling each reaction and what they imply about the structures.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups, so A is likely a ketone or aldehyde. The product B would be a cyanohydrin if A is a ketone. Wait, but HCN can also add to esters or maybe other carbonyls. Alternatively, maybe A is an aldehyde or ketone, and B is the corresponding cyanohydrin.

But wait, another possibility is that if A is a cycloketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. Let me think about that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, HCN adds to carbonyl groups. For a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached. So the structure would have an OH and a CN on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but wait, the product of HCN addition to a ketone is a cyanohydrin. So, for example, cyclopentanone reacting with HCN gives (cyclopentylidene) cyanohydrin. So B would have this structure.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. H2 and Pd are conditions for catalytic hydrogenation. What gets reduced in B? B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol group and a cyanide group. Wait, but Pd and H2 usually hydrogenate triple bonds, maybe also cyano groups.

Wait, H2 and Pd (like in catalytic hydrogenation) typically reduce triple bonds to single bonds. So if B has a triple bond, it would become single. But in a cyanohydrin, the CN is a nitrile group. So maybe the nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to CH2NH2 or CH2NH something. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile group (R-CN) upon hydrogenation becomes R-CH2-NH2? No, wait, no, wait. Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles (CN) typically requires higher pressures or different catalysts. Wait, no, wait, sometimes Pd/C with H2 can reduce nitriles to amines, but I think more commonly, LiAlH4 is used for that. Alternatively, maybe under certain conditions, the nitrile can be hydrogenated to a primary amine. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is reduced to an amine group, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction again. The cyanohydrin has an alcohol group and a cyano group. So when B is hydrogenated, what happens? Let's consider each functional group.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile group (R-C≡N) is reduced to R-CH2-NH2, but that would require more vigorous conditions. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but that might require a different catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is hydrogenated to a methylene group. Wait
