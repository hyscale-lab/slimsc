Okay, so I have this question about molecular symmetry, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. The question asks which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. I remember that C3h means a three-fold rotation axis, and a horizontal mirror plane. Let me think about each option.

First, what's C3h symmetry? I think C3h is a point group that includes a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule should look the same when rotated 120 degrees around an axis and also have a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis.

Looking at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, triphenyleno sounds like it has three phenyl groups attached. The structure might have multiple rings. I'm not exactly sure about the structure, but the name suggests a trifuran system with substituents.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. This one also sounds like a furan-based molecule with benzene rings attached. Maybe it's a bicyclic structure with ketone groups.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. The structure is symmetric because each isopropyl is the same. The molecule is trigonal planar around boron, right? So does it have C3 symmetry? Wait, but C3h is more than that. Oh wait, if the molecule has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane, then maybe yes. Let me think: the molecule is symmetric. Each isopropyl is identical, so a rotation by 120 degrees would leave it unchanged. Now, is there a mirror plane? If I imagine looking along the B-C axis, perhaps the molecule could have a horizontal mirror. Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is perpendicular to the three-fold axis. Since each isopropyl is symmetric, the molecule might have the required symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, I think. It's a norbornane derivative. Its structure has a bridge, so the symmetry might be lower. Quinuclidine has a three-membered bridge, but I'm not sure about the symmetry. I recall that quinuclidine has a three-fold axis, perhaps, but I'm not certain if it has a mirror plane as well. Alternatively, it might belong to a different point group like C3v or something else.

So putting it all together, which molecule has C3h symmetry. C3h requires a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. 

Triisopropyl borate: It's symmetric with three identical substituents around the central boron. So rotation by 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. Now, does it have a mirror plane? If the mirror is in the plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis (the plane where the boron is), then yes. Because each isopropyl group is symmetric, the mirror plane would reflect each group onto itself. So triisopropyl borate probably has C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: I'm not so sure. Quinuclidine's structure is more complex. It's a bridged bicyclic amine. I think it has a three-fold axis, but I'm not certain about the mirror plane. Maybe it has a C3v symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes, not horizontal. So maybe it doesn't have a horizontal mirror, which is required for C3h.

The other options, B and A, are more complex. The benzo and triphenylene ones might have higher symmetry, but I'm not sure if they have the C3h. Alternatively, maybe they have different point groups. For example, if they have multiple substituents arranged symmetrically, perhaps they have a higher point group like D3h, but that's beyond what the question is asking.

Wait, the question is about C3h symmetry. So which one fits. Triisopropyl borate is a good candidate. The structure is trigonal planar with three identical groups. So rotation and mirror plane should be present.

So the options are:

A) Option A: triphenyleno...
B) Option B: benzo...
C) Option C: triisopropyl borate
D) Option D: quinuclidine

So the correct answer would be option C: triisopropyl borate.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the options based on the defining characteristics of the C₃h point group: a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a complex bicyclic structure with three phenyl groups attached. While it may have some symmetry, its intricate structure likely does not possess a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not fit the C₃h symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is also a bicyclic structure with ketone groups and benzene rings. Its symmetry is likely lower than C₃h, as the arrangement of substituents does not support a three-fold rotation axis or a horizontal mirror plane.

### Option C: Triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is symmetric, with a three-fold rotation axis that leaves the structure unchanged when rotated by 120°. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the three-fold axis, as each isopropyl group is symmetric and lies in the same plane. This satisfies the requirements for C₃h symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bridge structure. While it may have a three-fold rotation axis, its symmetry is likely lower than C₃h due to the absence of a horizontal mirror plane. It may belong to a different point group, such as C₃v, which includes vertical mirror planes but not a horizontal one.

### Conclusion  
Among the options, **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) is the only molecule that possesses both a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, fulfilling the requirements for C₃h symmetry.

Answer: C
