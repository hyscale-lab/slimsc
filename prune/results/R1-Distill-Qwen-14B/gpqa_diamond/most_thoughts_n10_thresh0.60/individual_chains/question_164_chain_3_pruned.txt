Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We need to consider the mass of each system as the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I recall is K = (v * (1 - e²)^(1/2)) / (2πG * (P/(2π))^(1/3) * (M_total)^(2/3)) ) ... Wait, maybe I should think of the mass function instead. 

Alternatively, I think the mass of each star can be found using Kepler's third law and the radial velocity data. The mass function for each star relates the observed velocity semi-amplitude to the masses. Or wait, maybe I should remember that the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars.

Wait, let me think. In a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit because the center of mass is closer to it. So the velocity amplitude (how much the star moves towards and away from us) is inversely proportional to the mass. So if star A has mass M_A and velocity K_A, and star B has mass M_B and velocity K_B, then M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A.

Wait, I think the correct formula is: K_A / K_B = (M_B sin i) / (M_A sin i) ) → since sin i is the same for both (assuming same inclination, which is probably the case for eclipsing binaries), it simplifies to K_A / K_B = M_B / M_A. So M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A.

Wait, let me get this right. The mass ratio is M1/M2 = (K2) / (K1). Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if star A is more massive than star B, its velocity K_A will be smaller than K_B. So K_A/K_B = M_B/(M_A) → M_A/M_B = K_B / K_A.

So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio (M1/M2) for system_1 is (5)/(10) = 0.5. So the mass of the first star is half the mass of the second in system_1? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me correct, because in system_1, the two stars have velocities K1 and K2. So for system_1, star A has K1=10,
