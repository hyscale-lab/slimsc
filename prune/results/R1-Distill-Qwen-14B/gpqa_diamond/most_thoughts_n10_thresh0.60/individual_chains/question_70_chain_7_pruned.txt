Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem describes a series of reactions. I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, first, I should probably try to identify each compound involved. Let's go through each reaction.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that when a solid reacts with a gas in a specific ratio, it's often a red product. Oh wait, maybe something like sulfur reacting with something? Or perhaps a metal reacting with a halogen. Wait, but the product is bright red—maybe it's a transition metal sulfide or something else.

Wait, another thought: I remember that when metals like sodium or potassium react with halogens, they form bright colored products. But I'm not sure yet. Let's move on.

The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is dangerous, so maybe something like a gas cylinder or a toxic substance. Hmm, but what's C? If C is a compound, and reacting with D gives E, which is dangerous, perhaps E is a gas like chlorine or something else.

Wait, another clue: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is in water, it hydrolyzes into A, F, and G. Let's think about which compound does that.

A strong acid and a weak acid—so maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2SO3 or something else. Wait, no, HCl is strong, H2SO3 is weak. Or maybe F is H2SO4? No, H2SO4 is strong. Alternatively, think of F as HNO3 (strong), and G as H3PO4 (moderately strong, but maybe in this context considered weak? Or perhaps H2S is a weak acid, but that doesn't fit.)

Wait, maybe it's about a sulfide. Let me think: if C is a sulfide, like Na2S or something. Wait, no, when Na2S reacts with water, it doesn't produce two different acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is something like a
