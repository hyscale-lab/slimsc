Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me start by recalling what I know about these instruments.

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, it's brighter than 17, meaning magnitude less than 17, right? Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag or brighter. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16.

So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude less than 17 (so ESPRESSO can see it) and less than or equal to 16 (so HIRES can also see it). So the star's apparent V mag must be â‰¤16.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means stars with V <17 are observable. Similarly, HIRES can do stars brighter than 16 V, so V <16. So a star must be brighter than both, but wait, no. Wait, the brighter the star (lower mag), the more instruments can see it. So, the star must have V mag less
