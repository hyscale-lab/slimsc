Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can do up to 16 V mag. So the star's apparent magnitude needs to be ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17? Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can handle V up to 17. HIRES can observe up to 16, because stars brighter than 16 mag would be too faint for HIRES. Wait, no, no. Wait, when they say "brighter than 17 mag", does that mean the apparent magnitude is less than 17? Because higher magnitude numbers mean fainter, right. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V ≤17 can be observed. For HIRES, stars with V ≤16 can be observed. So a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤17 (so ESPRESSO can detect it) and ≤16 (so HIRES can detect it). Wait, no, because both have to be true. Wait, no. Because for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than each
