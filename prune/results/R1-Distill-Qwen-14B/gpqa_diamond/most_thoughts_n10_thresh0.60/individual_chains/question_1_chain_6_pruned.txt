Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but when you're trying to resolve two energy levels, the time during which each state exists might matter for the uncertainty. Alternatively, perhaps the time we should consider is the time it takes to measure the energy difference. Hmm, not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state.

Wait, no, the two states are being considered together. So perhaps the issue is about the measurement of the energy difference between the two. Or, more accurately, whether the energy difference is detectable given their lifetimes. 

If each state has a certain lifetime, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ/(2Δt). So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2Δt1) = ħ
