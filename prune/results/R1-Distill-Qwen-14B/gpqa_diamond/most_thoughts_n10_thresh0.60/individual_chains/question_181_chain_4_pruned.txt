Okay, so I need to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops. I remember the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton chains, and the pp-III branch is one of them. Oh right, the pp-I and pp-II are the main branches, and pp-III is a minor contributor. Wait, no, actually, I think the pp-III is another branch in the proton-proton cycle. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the details. Let me think again.

So, the solar neutrinos are mainly produced by the proton-proton chain. The main branch is the pp-I, which produces a 1-2 positron and some neutrinos. The pp-II branch produces a different energy of neutrinos. Oh wait, the main neutrino flux comes from the pp-I branch, and the others are less significant. But now they're talking about stopping pp-III.

Wait, the question says the pp-III branch stopped, so all other reactions are as usual. So, the pp-III is a source of neutrinos. Since it's stopped, the flux from that source would drop, but the others would remain. So, the flux of neutrinos is affected only by this branch stopping.

But the question is about the ratio of flux in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band
