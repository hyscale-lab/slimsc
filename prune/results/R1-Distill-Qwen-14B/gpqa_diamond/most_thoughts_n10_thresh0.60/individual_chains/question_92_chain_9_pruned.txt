Okay, so I have this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, the question gives me the bond energies for various bonds. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation is the difference between the bond energies of the reactants and the products. So, I think it's something like taking the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the reactants (which are the elements in their standard states, like H2 and C) minus the sum of the bond energies in the product molecule.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this molecule, I need to figure out how many bonds are being broken and formed.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up enthalpy of formation with bond energy calculations. Let me think again. When using bond energies to calculate the heat of formation, I should calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants (which are elements) and then subtract the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

But wait, the question gives the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 100
