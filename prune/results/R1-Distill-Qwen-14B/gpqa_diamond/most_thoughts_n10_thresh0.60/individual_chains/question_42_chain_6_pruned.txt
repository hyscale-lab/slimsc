Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, Planet3, each in a system with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think is transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just background info.

The question gives ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So the temp ratios are 1.4 and 2.3. Also, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So the masses are increasing as we go from Planet1 to Planet3? Wait, wait. Wait, Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, so Planet2 is 1.15 times more massive than Planet1. Then Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet3 is 1.35 times Planet2's mass. So overall, Planet3 is 1.15 * 1.35 times Planet1's mass. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35. 1.15 times 1 is 1.15, 1.15 times 0.35 is 0.4025, so total 1.5525. So Planet3's mass is about 1.55 times Planet1's. Hmm.

Wait, but I don't know if the mass comes into play here. Because the question is about orbital periods, which probably relates to Kepler's third law. Right, Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (which is the radius for circular orbits) divided by the sum of the masses. But wait, in the case where the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, the denominator is just the star's mass. But in this problem, we don't know the star's mass, and the planets' masses are varying. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but the question gives TTV data, which is
