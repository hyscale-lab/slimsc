Okay, let's see. I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, the key here is figuring out the apparent V magnitude for each star because each instrument has a different brightness limit.

So, I remember that apparent magnitude is how bright a star appears from Earth. The lower (or more negative) the magnitude, the brighter the star. But wait, higher magnitudes mean dimmer objects, right? So, like, a 5th magnitude star is brighter than a 16th.

The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, which I think means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because if a star is brighter (lower mag number), it's easier to see. So, ESPRESSO observes up to 17 mag. HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So a star needs to be brighter than 16 mag to be seen by HIRES, and not fainter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO.

Wait, wait. Let me get that straight. The question says, with ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, no, waitâ€”apparent magnitude is what's measured from Earth. So if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means its V magnitude is less than 17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than
