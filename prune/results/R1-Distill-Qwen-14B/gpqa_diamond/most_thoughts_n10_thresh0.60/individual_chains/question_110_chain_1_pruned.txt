Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

So the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I remember that each spectrograph has its own magnitude limit. From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the more easily it can be detected. So ESPRESSO can handle fainter stars up to 17, while HIRES can handle up to 16. So a star needs to be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait no, wait. Wait, the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So that means ESPRESSO can see stars with V less than or equal to 17. Because, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than 17, so it can be observed. Wait, wait, no, I think I have it backwards. Magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So if a star has apparent V magnitude of 16, that's brighter than 17
