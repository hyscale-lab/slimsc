Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The problem is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after the field change.

Hmm. So initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along z. Since it's spin 1/2, I know that the possible states are spin-up and spin-down along the z-axis. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, so the energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect. The energy is proportional to Sz, I think.

But wait, when the magnetic field is suddenly switched off, then turned on in the y-direction, what happens? The initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, but when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian will be proportional to Sy because the magnetic field is along Y now.

I remember that when the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change instantaneously. So the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, but after the change, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the system will now evolve under this new Hamiltonian.

But wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment, which is <mu_z>. Oh, because mu is gamma Sz, so <mu_z> is gamma times the expectation value of Sz, which is gamma <Sz>.

So what's the time evolution of <Sz> when the system is under a Hamiltonian proportional to Sy?

Let me think about the Hamiltonian. The energy for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is E = - mu · B. But here, mu is given as gamma Sz, and B is along Y, so the Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma Sz * B * direction.

Wait, no, wait. The Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B, right? Because the magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field. So mu is a vector, and B is along Y. So H = - mu · B = - (gamma Sx, gamma Sy, gamma Sz) · (0, B, 0) )? Wait
