Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's break this down. So the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay, and then determining which statement among the options is correct.

Alright, first, I need to understand what the operator Ay looks like. The problem says Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So let me write that down.

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

Wait, but wait, the intrinsic angular momentum operator for spin-½ particles is usually represented by the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh, but here, S might be similar but scaled differently. Let me think about the standard Pauli matrices. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], Y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is diagonal. Oh wait, the matrix S here looks exactly like the Pauli Y matrix. So S is σ_y.

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y. But wait, the standard spin matrices are S = (ħ/2) σ. So for spin in the y-direction, Sy = (ħ/2) σ_y. Comparing that to Ay, which is (h/(4π)) σ_y. Wait, but h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) equals ħ/(2). Because ħ = h/(2π), so h/(4π) = (h/(2π)) / 2 = ħ/2. Oh, right! So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y, which is exactly the form of Sy. So Ay is the spin operator in the y-direction, scaled by some factor?

Wait, actually, let me compute it. Since c is h/(4π), and since ħ is h/(2π), so c is ħ/(2). So Ay = (ħ/2) σ_y, which is the same as Sy, the y
