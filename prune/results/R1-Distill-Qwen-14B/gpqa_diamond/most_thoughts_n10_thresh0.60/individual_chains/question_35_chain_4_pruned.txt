Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π). Oh wait, right, h is Planck's constant. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S is a 2x2 matrix:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So Ay is c*S. Let me write that out. c is h/(4π), so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question is about which statement is correct regarding this calculation.

Looking at the options, let's first figure out what the eigenvalues of Ay are. Eigenvalues come from solving det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So let me compute Ay - a I:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]
So Ay matrix looks like:
[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

So Ay - a I is:

[ [ -a ,  -i*(h/(4π)) ],
  [ i*(h/(4π)),  -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ] = a² - [ (-i^2)*(h^2/(16π²)) ) ]

Wait wait, let me compute that term. The product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i*(h/(4π)))*(i*(h/(4π)) ). Let me calculate that:

(-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. Because i squared is -1. So 1*(h²/(16π²)).

So determinant becomes a² - [ (h²/(16π²)) ] = 0.

So the equation is a² = h²/(16π²)
Taking square roots gives a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the determinant is a² - (h²/(16π²)) = 0. So a² = (h/(4π))². So a = ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers here.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A says the imaginary part are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues I just found are purely real, so the imaginary part is zero. So option A is talking about complex eigenvalues, which can't be right because we have a Hermitian operator
