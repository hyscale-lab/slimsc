Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. I think these reactions involve the shifting of a pi bond into a sigma bond. The question gives three different reactions and asks which products (A, B, C) are correct.

Let me take each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol with H+ and heat. Hmm. I'm trying to remember what kind of reaction this setup would lead to. Oh wait, the presence of H+ and heat might indicate an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. Maybe a Cope or Claisen rearrangement? Wait, but those typically involve 1,5-dienes or similar structures. Wait, but the starting materials here are different.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is [CH3O]2CH-NH2. And but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂CH₂CH₂OH, no. Wait, let me write the structures.

But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4, but wait but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂CH₂CH(OH)CH3? No, but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait: but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂CH₂CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CH(OH)CH3 with a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH₂CH₂-CH(OH)-CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, because but-3-en-2-ol would be in a four-carbon chain. The position is 2 and 3. So, it's CH₂CH₂CH(OH
