Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. They're pericyclic reactions, which usually involve concerted movements of electrons. The question has three parts, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the given reactants and conditions.

Let me look at each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat gives product A. Wait, what's the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine? I think it's (CH3O)2CHNH2. Or wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2, so 1,1-dimethoxy would be OMe groups on the same carbon. So that would be CH2(NH2)(OMe)2? No, wait, no. Ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then the structure is (CH2(OCH3)2)NH2? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Oh, perhaps it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe it's (CH2OCH2CH2OCH3)NH2? Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, it's (CH2(OCH3)2)CH2NH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be:

The ethanamine is NH2CH2CH2-, but if it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then the amine is on carbon 1, which already has two methoxy groups. So, structure is (CH2OCH3)2NH. Wait, noâ€”that's 1,1-dimethoxy substituted on the ethyl group. Wait, maybe it's (OCH3)2CHNH2. So the NH2 is attached to a carbon that has two OCH3 groups. So the structure is (OCH3)2CHNH2. So that's 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine. Or perhaps I should think of it as the am
