Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I know that the spin operator along z-axis has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |up> and -ħ/2 for |down>.

Now, the task is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given by A_ij, where A_ij is ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, that's an interesting matrix. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with up and down states), let me write out what it looks like.

For a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j can each be 1 or 2 (corresponding to |up> and |down>). So, A_12 is ħ/2, A_21 is ħ/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are 0. So the matrix A looks like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

Hmm, that's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are different from the standard |up> and |down> states. So, the operator A has eigenstates that are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/√2 and (|up> - |down>)/√2. The corresponding eigenvalues would be ± ħ/2 * 2? Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So, since A is (ħ/2) σ_x, its eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(+1) and (ħ/2)(-1), which are +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

Wait, no
