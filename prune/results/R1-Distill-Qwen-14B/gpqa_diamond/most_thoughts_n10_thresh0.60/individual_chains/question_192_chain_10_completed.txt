Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Alright, the setup is a bit tricky, but I'll break it down.

So, there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and it's smaller than R. Now, they put a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l is greater than R, and so is L. Also, the angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, I remember something about conductors and charges. Oh right! When a conductor is neutral, and you put a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface gets induced charges. But since the conductor is uncharged overall, the inner surface must have induced charges opposite to the enclosed charge, and the outer surface would have induced charges equal and opposite to the inner ones, but wait no, wait. No, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on the conductor is zero.

When you have a charge inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) gets an induced charge of -q because the conductor is neutral. Then, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance, because the inner is -q and the conductor is neutral overall. So the outer surface has +q.

But wait, the point P is outside the conductor. So, when calculating the electric field outside a conductor, the field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. That's the shell theorem, right? So for a spherical shell, the electric field outside is the same as if the charge were a point charge at the center.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So at any point outside the conductor, the E field is due to that +q charge.

Wait, but why? Because the conductor is a sphere, and any excess charge resides on the outer surface. So the field outside is determined by the total charge on the conductor, which in this case is +q.

Wait, but the conductor itself is uncharged. Wait, no, the conductor is initially uncharged. When the charge +q is placed in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) gets an induced charge of -q. Since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q. Right.

So, for any point outside the conductor, the electric field is due to the +q charge on the outer surface. Because the conductor acts as if the charge is at its center.

Wait, but the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So, the E field at P due to the outer surface charge is (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / (L²). Because it's as if the charge is a point charge at the center.

But wait, the problem says that the charge is somehow placed inside the cavity. So, in reality, the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer +q. So the field outside is due to the +q. But wait, regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity, the outer surface will have +q. So the E field outside depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q.

So, the answer should be the same as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. So the E field at P is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Looking at the options, that's option B.

But wait, let me make sure. The point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and l is the distance from P to the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta. So, perhaps there's some consideration about the position of the charge within the cavity. But no, because once the conductor adjusts, the outer field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, not on where the internal charge is placed.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface must have -q, and the outer +q. So the field outside is as if the +q is at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the +q was placed in the cavity, the field outside is the same.

So the answer is option B: E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, why are the other options present? Let's see what each option represents.

Option A: (l - s cosθ)^2. That seems like the distance from P to the charge's position, but that's inside the conductor, so the field outside shouldn't depend on that.

Option C: (l + s cosθ)^2. Not sure, maybe some vector addition. But outside the conductor, the field is as if all the charge were at the center. So the distance is L, so B is correct.

Option D: l squared. But l is the distance from P to the cavity's center, which is inside the conductor. So no, the field outside depends on the distance from the conductor's center, which is L.

So, the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity inside. The cavity's center is separated by a distance $s$ from the conductor's center, and the radius of the cavity is $r$, where $r < R$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. The task is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the conductor's center. The distance from $P$ to the cavity's center is $l$, and $l, L > R$. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity of a neutral conductor, the inner surface of the conductor (cavity wall) induces a charge of $-q$, and the outer surface of the conductor induces a charge of $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality. The electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor (by the shell theorem).

Since the outer surface of the conductor has a total charge of $+q$, the electric field at point $P$ outside the conductor is determined by this charge. The distance from $P$ to the conductor's center is $L$, so the electric field at $P$ is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This result is independent of the position of the charge inside the cavity or the geometry involving $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, as the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the conductor's center.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Depends on $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is irrelevant because the field outside the conductor does not depend on the cavity's geometry.
- **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$.
- **Option C**: Depends on $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is also irrelevant for the same reason as Option A.
- **Option D**: Depends on $l^2$, which is the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center, but this is inside the conductor and does not determine the field outside.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
