Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think through this carefully.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I'm supposed to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are A to D, each with different coordinates like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc.

I remember that a qubit is a two-level system, so the state space is two-dimensional. The density matrix for a pure state is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, and for a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of projectors. 

So, ρ here is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with a coefficient of 1/2. That means it's an equal superposition in terms of the basis states. Wait, no, wait—each term is a projector, so it's a classical mixture. So this would represent a completely mixed state, right? Because mixing |0> and |1> equally without any coherences.

In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to the point (0,0,0). Because the density matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal. 

Wait, let
