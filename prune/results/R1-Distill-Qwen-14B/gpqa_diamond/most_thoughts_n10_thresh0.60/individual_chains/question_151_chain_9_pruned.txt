Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty on my linear algebra, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain value (which is 0) for an observable represented by the matrix P, given the state vector of the system.

Alright, so the state vector at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three elements, so it's a 3x1 column vector. Let me write that down:

State vector, let's call it ψ, is:
[-1]
[ 2]
[ 1]

And the observable P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0). The second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2). The third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). Let me write that out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So, I need to find the eigenvalues of P because the possible results are those eigenvalues. Wait, but the question is specifically asking about the probability of getting 0 as a result. So 0 must be one of the eigenvalues of P.

Wait a second, how do I
