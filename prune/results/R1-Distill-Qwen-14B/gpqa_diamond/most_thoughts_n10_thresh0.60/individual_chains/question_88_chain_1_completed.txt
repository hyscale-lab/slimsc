Okay, so I have this question about rotavirus and some process happening in the immune system. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

First, the question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, they saw high variability. So the question is which process is happening.

Hmm, so I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're like structures in the small intestine that sample antigens from the intestinal lumen. So when the GFP-tagged proteins are given orally, they probably get taken up by these patches.

The GFP was destroyed by stomach acid in some places, but I guess the Peyer patches are in the small intestine, not the stomach. Wait, the stomach is where the acid is, but Peyer patches are in the ileum, right? So the proteins might have passed through the stomach, where some fluorescence was lost due to acid, but then reached the small intestine. Some got stuck in mucus, but others probably made it to the Peyer patches.

Once in the Peyer patches, the tagged proteins would be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, maybe dendritic cells or M cells. Then these would present the antigen to B cells. Since the B cells are activated, they start proliferating and differentiating. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that each B cell's antibody is different. 

Wait, but when do B cells undergo changes in their variable regions? I remember that B cells can undergo somatic hypermutation, which introduces point mutations in the variable region of the immunoglobulin genes. This increases the diversity of the antibodies produced. Also, during the germinal center reactions, this process happens, leading to affinity maturation.

Alternatively, class switching involves changing the class of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't change the variable region's variability. VDJ recombination is during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow, which happens during lymphocyte development. But if these are already mature B cells, that might not be the case.

So the process here is likely somatic hypermutation, which occurs in the germinal centers after the initial immune response, leading to a diverse set of antibodies. The high variability in the variable heavy chains supports this. 

So the options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation (which is about activating the complement system, not directly about gene variability), C) class switching (changing the isotype), and D) VDJ (early recombination).

The fact that the cells are proliferating and their variable genes are diverse points to ongoing mutations during the immune response, which is somatic hypermutation.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged rotavirus inner capsid proteins are delivered to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence is partially destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). In the Peyer patches, the tagged proteins are likely taken up by antigen-presenting cells, activating B cells that proliferate and differentiate. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these proliferating cells reveals high variability.

Peyer patches are specialized structures in the small intestine that sample antigens from the intestinal lumen and initiate immune responses. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests that the B cells undergoing proliferation are diversifying their antibody repertoires. This process is consistent with **somatic hypermutation**, which introduces point mutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes during the germinal center reaction. This mechanism increases antibody diversity and affinity, supporting the immune response.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **Complement activation** (B) is a part of the immune response but does not directly explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Class switching recombination** (C) changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variability of the variable region.
- **VDJ recombination** (D) occurs during the early development of B cells in the bone marrow, not during the proliferative phase in secondary lymphoid organs.

The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in germinal centers during the immune response.

Answer: A
