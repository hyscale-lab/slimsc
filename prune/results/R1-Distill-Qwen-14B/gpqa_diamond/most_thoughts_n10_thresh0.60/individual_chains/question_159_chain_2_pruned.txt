Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The flux peaks at around 790 nm and drops significantly below that. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what that means. Oh right, when we observe objects at high redshifts, their light gets stretched into longer wavelengths due to the expansion of the universe. So if the peak is at 790 nm, maybe the emitted wavelength was in the optical range, like around 550 nm (which is green light), and it's been redshifted.

Wait, the peak in the spectrum is probably from a specific emission line, like the Lyman-alpha emission or something else. But I'm not sure which line. Let me think. The Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, around 121 nm. So if redshifted to 790 nm, that's a factor of about 6.5 (790/121 ≈ 6.5). But wait, that's for Lyman-alpha. If the peak is at 790, and the flux drops below that, maybe it's the rest-frame optical emission, which when redshifted into near-infrared would imply a certain redshift.

Alternatively, another prominent emission line is the Balmer series in hydrogen. For example, H-alpha is at about 656 nm in the rest frame. If that's redshifted to 790, then the redshift z would be (790 - 656)/656 ≈ (134)/656
