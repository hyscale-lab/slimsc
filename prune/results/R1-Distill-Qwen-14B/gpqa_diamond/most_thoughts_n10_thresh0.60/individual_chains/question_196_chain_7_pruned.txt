Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator, so I don't have to worry about multiple dimensions complicating things. The mass is m, maximum amplitude is A, and it follows Hooke's law, F = -kx. Wait, but it's relativistic, so I can't just use the regular harmonic oscillator equations. Oh right, in relativity, momentum and energy come into play differently.

I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case. So I can't use that formula anymore.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; it's gamma minus one times mc². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in the system would be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, the oscillator doesn't have any external energy source, right? So the total mechanical energy (potential plus kinetic) should equal the rest energy plus the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point, I think.

Wait, no, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx².
