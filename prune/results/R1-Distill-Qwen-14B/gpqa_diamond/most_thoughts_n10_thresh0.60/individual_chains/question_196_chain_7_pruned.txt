Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So the problem is about a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, harmonic oscillators... I remember in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed depending on its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I need to consider special relativity effects, right? Because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But since this is relativistic, that formula wouldn't hold, and we need to adjust for relativistic mass or energy considerations.

Wait, relativistic harmonic oscillators... I think their energy is a combination of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy in relativity is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is also (1/2)kA². But wait, no, actually, in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², so at maximum amplitude, the potential is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, the energy would be higher because of the gamma factor.

So maybe the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Or perhaps the energy is just the total, which would be the rest energy multiplied by gamma? Hmm.

Wait, I think for a relativistic oscillator, the total energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy, but wait, no. Let me think again.

In a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement. But in relativity, energy isn't just potential; it's the total energy. So maybe the energy of the oscillator is E = gamma mc² = (1/2)kA² + (1/2)mv_max². No, that
