Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in non-relativistic mechanics, the harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are going to be a bit different because of special relativity effects.

The problem states a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. So it's like a spring where the force is proportional to displacement, but in the relativistic context.

I need to find the maximum speed v_max. In the non-relativistic case, v_max would just be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the non-relativistic case. So in relativity, things are more complicated because kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

In relativity, the total energy E is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The rest energy is m c², and the kinetic energy is E - m c². So for the oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and at maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential. As it moves towards equilibrium, the potential energy converts to kinetic. So at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. But wait, in the relativistic case, does this still hold?

Wait, actually, in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the energy isn't just split into kinetic and potential like in the non-relativistic case. Or maybe it is, but the expressions are different. Let's think about it.

The total energy at maximum displacement is the potential energy, which is (1/2)k A². But in relativity, the kinetic energy when the oscillator is at x=0 (velocity maximum) would be E - m c². So the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But wait, no, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is conserved. But in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of rest and kinetic; it's the total energy which is gamma m c².

Wait, maybe I should model this using the conservation of energy. The total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So when x is maximum (A), the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. All the energy is potential: E = (1/2) k A². But wait, in relativity, is that the case?

Wait, perhaps in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2) k x². Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Because in relativity, the expression for force might change, or the potential might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the potential is still (1/2) k x², and kinetic energy is the relativistic expression.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the force is the same as Newtonian, but the mass is relativistic.

So the potential energy would still be the integral of F dx, which is (1/2) k x². Same as before. But the kinetic energy is relativistic: (gamma - 1) m c².

So the total mechanical energy (assuming no other forms of energy) is the sum of kinetic and potential. So at maximum displacement x = A, v=0, so kinetic energy is zero, and E = (1/2)k A².

At the equilibrium point x=0, the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic: E = (gamma - 1) m c². Wait, but if E is (1/2)k A², then:

(1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But what's gamma at maximum speed? Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). So let me write that equation:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

We can rearrange this to solve for gamma.

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, let me double-check:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Wait, but this seems a bit off. Let's compute it step by step.

E = (1/2) k A²

E is also the total energy which is (gamma -1) m c^2.

Thus,

gamma = 1 + ( (1/2) k A^2 )/( m c^2 )

Which is,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Now, gamma is greater than 1, so this expression must be positive. Therefore, the denominator 2 m c^2 must be positive, which it is. So as long as k and A are positive, it works.

Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Let me call (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = beta for simplicity.

So gamma = 1 + beta.

Then,

gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + beta.

So,

1/(sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)) = 1 + beta.

Let me solve for v.

First, invert both sides:

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + beta)

Then square both sides:

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/( (1 + beta)^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/( (1 + beta)^2 )

Factor this.

Alternatively,

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + beta)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta)^2

Expand numerator:

(1 + 2 beta + beta^2) - 1 = 2 beta + beta^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 beta + beta^2) / (1 + beta)^2

Factor numerator: beta (2 + beta) 

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = beta (2 + beta) / (1 + beta)^2.

But beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), which is small if k A^2 << 2 m c^2. But let's see what beta is in terms of the given options.

Wait, but let me see if I can manipulate this expression to match any of the options. Let's substitute beta back in.

beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ]

Simplify numerator:

Inside the numerator, the first term is (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) multiplied by ( 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Let me write that as:

[k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ 2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ]

Which can be written as:

[ k A^2/(2 m c^2 ) ] * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Wait, 2 is 2*(2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ), so 2 = 4 m c^2/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, no, 2 is equal to 2 *1, but perhaps another approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to factor.

Wait, perhaps another way: let me factor out (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) from the numerator.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: beta*(2 + beta) = beta (2 + beta )
Denominator: (1 + beta)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2.

Let me factor beta into beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, so,

v^2/c^2 = [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2

Let me compute numerator and denominator.

But perhaps I can factor this expression differently. Let me write it as:

v^2/c^2 = [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta)^2

Expanding numerator:

beta (2 + beta) = 2 beta + beta^2.

Denominator: (1 + beta)^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

v^2/c² = (2 beta + beta²) / (1 + 2 beta + beta² )

Hmm.

Wait, can I factor numerator and denominator in terms of (beta + 1)?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write in terms of denominator being (1 + beta)^2.

Wait, what if I write:

v^2/c² = [beta (2 + beta)] / (1 + beta)^2 

= [ beta ( (beta + 1) + 1 ) ] / (1 + beta)^2

= [ beta ( (1 + beta) + 1 ) ] / (1 + beta)^2 

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor numerator beta (beta + 2) and denominator (beta +1)^2.

Wait, let's compute this:

[ beta (beta + 2) ] = beta^2 + 2 beta.

Denominator (beta +1)^2 = beta² + 2 beta +1.

So,

v²/c² = ( beta² + 2 beta ) / ( beta² + 2 beta + 1 ) 

= [ (beta^2 + 2 beta +1 ) - 1 ] / ( beta^2 + 2 beta +1 )

= [ (beta +1 )^2 -1 ] / (beta +1 )^2 

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(beta +1 )^2 ]

Which can be written as,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( (1 + beta )^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + beta )^2 ) )

Wait, that's looking similar to one of the options. Let me compute 1/( (1 + beta )^2 ) as 1/( [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 )

Wait, but looking at the options. Let me look at option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Wait, that's exactly what I have here. Because:

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) )

Which matches option D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Alternative approach: Wait, what if I consider the energy equation again.

E = (1/2)k A^2 = (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma = (E + m c² )/(m c² )

Gamma = ( (1/2)k A^2 + m c² )/( m c² )

Wait, no, because E is (gamma -1) m c², so E = (1/2)k A^2.

So,

gamma = (E )/( m c² ) + 1 = ( (1/2)k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) + 1 = 1 + (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as before.

So gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 )) = 1 + (k A^2 )/( 2 m c^2 )

So,

1/( sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ) = 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me denote (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) as beta again.

Then,

sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ) = 1/(1 + beta )

Square both sides,

1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/(1 + beta )^2

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 

Which is,

v/c = sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

Substituting beta,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( 1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So, the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and force obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total mechanical energy of the oscillator is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all energy is potential energy, given by \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic energy, expressed relativistically as \( E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

   Equating the two expressions for energy:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging the above equation:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is also related to velocity by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we solve for \( v \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]
   Inverting and squaring both sides:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
