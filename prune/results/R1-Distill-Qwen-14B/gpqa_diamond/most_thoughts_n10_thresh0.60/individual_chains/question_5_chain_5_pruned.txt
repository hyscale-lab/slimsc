Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for the spin in an arbitrary direction n is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices and the direction vector. So the operator P should be something like P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z), right? But wait, in this case, the question says that the operator is along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

So the operator for spin along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n_y is zero. Hmm, but wait, I think the usual spin operator is S·n, which is (Sx nx + Sy ny + Sz nz). So yeah, since ny is zero here, that term drops out.

Wait, but in the question, the operator is P, which is given as a vector with components Px, Py, Pz. So when the direction is arbitrary, the operator becomes P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. But since the direction is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So Py doesn't contribute. So the operator simplifies to P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

Each component is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So let's write them down.

Px is given as (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P along n is (n_x * Px + n_z * Pz), each scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, no, wait. Each component is already multiplied by ħ/2. So P = (n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]) ) * (ħ/2). So that's correct.

But wait, in the problem statement, it says that the operator is given along an arbitrary direction n. So I need to construct the operator P as a combination of Px, Py, and Pz.

Wait, but the direction is in the x-z plane, so n is (n_x, 0, n_z). So the operator P is (n_x Px + n_z Pz) multiplied by ħ/2. Because Py
