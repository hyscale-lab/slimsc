Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so it's a base. When you add a strong acid to it, they should react. The question gives me the mass of Fe(OH)3 and the volume of the solution. They want to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to dissolve it and also the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I need to figure out the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, like HCl, the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Oh wait, wait. Wait, Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so the acid would need to donate three H+ ions. So the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Right, so the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles of H+.

Next, I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The mass given is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3—Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. So moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles.

Since the reaction requires 3 moles of acid per mole of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M. So Molarity = moles/volume(L). So volume = moles / Molarity. Moles needed is 0.002808, so volume = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, the problem says "minimum volume" needed. Oh, but wait, the total solution volume is 100 cm³. Wait, no, wait. The problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So when we add the acid, the total volume after mixing should be 100 cm³. So wait, does that affect the calculation? Hmm, perhaps not directly, because when you add the acid, the volume might not just be the acid's volume, but the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the initial volume is 100 cm³, so the acid volume is part of that? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution after dissolving will be 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, the volume of the acid plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution equals 100 cm³? Or perhaps the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and the total is 100 cm³. Hmm, I'm not sure, but perhaps for the purposes of calculation, the volume of the acid is just the amount needed to react, regardless of the total solution. But wait, the reaction requires a certain amount of H+ to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. So I think the initial approach is correct—calculate the moles of H+ needed, then find the volume from the acid concentration.

Wait, but the calculation I did gave me about 28.08 cm³, which is option C's volume of 28.05 cm³. But looking at the options, option B has 30.09 cm³, which is higher. So why would the volume needed be higher than 28 cm³? Maybe I'm missing
