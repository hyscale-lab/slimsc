Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago, while all other reactions continue normally. We need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux band 1 divided by flux band 2.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain in the Sun's core, right? The pp chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I and pp-II branches produce different neutrinos. Oh wait, pp-I produces positrons when two protons fuse, and pp-II and pp-III may produce different isotopes or something else.

Wait, I think the pp chain has a few branches. The main ones are pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. The dominant one is the pp-I branch, which produces a positron, but the pp-II and pp-III branches involve more steps. Each branch emits neutrinos, so if one branch stops, the total neutrino flux from that part would drop.

But here, only the pp-III branch is stopped. So, all other reactions continue. So, the question is about how this affects the neutrino flux in two different energy bands.

I remember that the neutr
