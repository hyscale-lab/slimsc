Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each with different reactants, and I need to find the major products. Then I have to match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: Dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. Wait, malonate esters are typically used as enolate donors in the Michael reaction. So the enolate would attack the beta carbon of the other alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon (since it's 3-(p-tolyl)). Wait, no, wait. The structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OCH3? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the middle carbon. Wait, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the p-tolyl group is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-para-CH3)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Hmm, not sure, maybe it's better to think of it as the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is at the third position, which would be on the beta position relative to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, it will add to the beta position of the acrylate.

So, dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2COOCH2COOCH3. Its enolate would form at the central carbon, attacking the beta carbon of the acrylate.

Wait, so the enolate is a strong base, right? The sodium ethoxide would deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate. Then, the enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So, the acrylate in this case has the structure CH2=C(R)-COOCH3, where R is the p-tolyl group. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

When the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position (the CH2 group), the addition would connect the two molecules. So the malonate's enolate adds to the CH2, making a new bond. So, the product would be a longer carbon chain.

Wait, the attack is at the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the
