Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction A:

Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, which is the electrophilic part. The nucleophile here would be the enolate of dimethyl malonate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because its enolate is strong. The structure of dimethyl malonate is like CH2(CO2Me)2. So when it forms an enolate, it becomes a strong base. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, because the substituent is at the 3 position. So the structure is probably CH2(CO2Me)CH2-p-tolyl in E configuration? Or maybe (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2CH(p-tolyl)CO-OCH3. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

The acrylate has a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-(p-tolyl)COOCH3? No, wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the (E) configuration indicates the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other.

The acrylate is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 2 and the COOCH3 on carbon 3.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the p-tolyl is on the middle carbon. So, it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? I'm getting a bit tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CH-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOCH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-p
