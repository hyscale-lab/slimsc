Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. 

The given concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The problem also states that the pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and can form the complex efficiently. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation directly here. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. 

Wait, what's the formation constant again? Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion. For the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-, Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). 

So the solution contains the complex, and I need to find [Ca²+]. Let's denote the concentration of CaEDTA^2- as 0.02 M since that's the concentration of the complex given. 

At equilibrium, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let's let the concentration of Ca²+ be x. Since the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. 

So substituting into the Kf expression: Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca²+][EDTA^4-] ) → 5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Wait, solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 0.02 / 5e10. Let me compute that. 

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13. Taking the square root, x is sqrt(4e-13) which is 2e-6.5. Wait, wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5, but 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7. 

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I set up the equation correctly? The Kf is 5e10, which is a large value, meaning the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low, which matches the answer I got. 

Another way to think: since Kf is very large, the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So very little Ca²+ remains in solution, which aligns with the low concentration we calculated.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The equilibrium reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming the dissociation of the complex produces equal concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\), let \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} = 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C. This result aligns with the expectation that the free calcium ion concentration is very low due to the large \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\), indicating a highly stable complex.

Answer: C
