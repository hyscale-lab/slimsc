Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free metal ion can be found using the formation constant. The formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal and ligand combine to form the complex.

The reaction in this case would be something like: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, the solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex already at 0.02 M. Since it's a stoichiometric solution, I'm assuming that the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are equal, right? Because for every one Ca²+ ion, there's one EDTA^4- ligand that binds to it.

So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, that would be the initial concentration before any dissociation. But because the formation constant is so large (5x10^10), which is a big K, that means the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So the dissociation of the complex into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- should be very small.

Wait, but in solution, the complex can dissociate a bit. So I can't just assume all the complex stays together. I need to calculate the dissociation.

Let me think about the expression. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C, which is 0.02 M. So initially, [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] are zero. But when it dissociates, some of the complex breaks down into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates. So, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x. [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA^4-] = x as well, because each dissociation produces one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, but EDTA is a polydentate ligand, right? So each EDTA^4- can bind multiple Ca²+ ions, but in this case, it's a 1:1 complex, so each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- per complex.

So substituting into the K expression, K = (0.02 - x)/(x * x) ≈ (0.02)/(x^2), because K is so large, x will be very small compared to 0.02. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So rearranging, K = 0.02/(x²) → x² = 0.02 / K → x = sqrt(0.02 / K).

Plugging in the numbers: K is 5e10.

So x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 2e-3 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-13 = 0.4e-13 → 4e-14.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. Oh, wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because 6.5 * 2 =13. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7.

Wait, let me compute that again. Because 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root is sqrt(4) * sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Hmm, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So that should be the answer.

Wait a second, but let me double-check the calculations. K is 5e10, and the initial concentration is 0.02 M. So K = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]). Assume both [Ca] and [EDTA] are x.

So K = 0.02/(x²) → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 / 5e10 = 4e-13. So x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → approximately 6.3e-7. Yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, the equilibrium concentration of \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is approximately \(0.02 - x\). Given that \(K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}\) is very large, \(x\) is expected to be very small compared to 0.02, so \(0.02 - x \approx 0.02\).

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)**.
