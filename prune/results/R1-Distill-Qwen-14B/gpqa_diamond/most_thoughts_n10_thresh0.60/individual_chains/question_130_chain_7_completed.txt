Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. They want to find the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm. I remember that redshift is a measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. When a quasar's light passes through a cloud of hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs it at specific wavelengths. The Lyman alpha line is one of those absorption lines, and it's in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see that because the atmosphere blocks ultraviolet light. So, if the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen, but the absorption is in the UV, how can ground-based telescopes detect it?

Ah, right! When the cloud is at a high redshift, the Lyman alpha absorption line shifts into a wavelength that optical telescopes can detect. Because if the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength of the absorption line would be stretched, moving it into the visible range. So the redshift (z) determines how much the wavelength shifts.

The key here is that for the absorption line to be in the optical range (which ground-based telescopes can see), the redshift must be such that 1216 Angstroms multiplied by (1+z) is less than about 3000 Angstroms. Because 3000 Angstroms is roughly the start of the near-infrared, but optical telescopes can detect up to around 700-900 nm, which is 7000-9000 Angstroms. Wait, no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So visible light is roughly 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me clarify: 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. For the absorption line to be in the visible range (say, 400 nm to 700 nm), the redshift z must satisfy 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms (since 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms).

Wait no, wait. Wait, the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). If the observed wavelength is in the optical range, say around 4000 Angstroms (400 nm) or higher, then 1 + z = lambda_obs / lambda_rest.

So, to be detected in optical, lambda_obs must be less than about 7000 Angstroms (700 nm), but wait, optical goes up to about 700 nm. Wait, optical is 400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength needs to be in this range.

So lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) must be >= 4000 Angstroms (so in the visible range). Because if it's shorter than that, it's in UV and not visible from the ground.

So let's set up the equation: 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Solving for (1 + z) >= 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So 1 + z ≈ 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

So the minimal redshift is around z ≈ 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. Wait, wait wait, I think I might have miscalculated. Let me redo the math.

Wait, 4000 divided by 1216 is approximately 3.29. So z is approximately 2.29. So the redshift must be at least about 2.29 for the absorption line to be in the visible range.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z where the absorption is just entering the visible spectrum. So any z higher than 2.29 would make the absorption line move even further into the visible range. So the lower limit is z ≈ 2.29. So looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and D is 1.9.

Wait, 2.29 is about 2.3, which is less than 2.4. So the lower limit would be 2.29, so any z higher than that would allow the absorption line to be in the optical. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct answer should be the smallest z that is just above 2.29. So among the options, the next higher is C) 2.4. But wait, the question is about the lower limit. So what is the minimal z such that the absorption is in the optical.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the maximum wavelength that can be observed. Wait, no, because the ground-based telescopes can't see beyond a certain wavelength. Let me think again.

Wait, the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 A. To be observed in the optical, the observed wavelength must be longer than 4000 A (since 4000 A is 400 nm, which is the start of the visible spectrum). Wait, wait, no: actually, the atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 3000 A (far UV). So for a ground-based telescope to detect the absorption line, the observed wavelength must be greater than about 3000 A. So 1216*(1+z) >= 3000.

So solving for (1+z) = 3000/1216 ≈ 2.466. So z = approximately 1.466. So z ≈ 1.466. So the lower limit would be z > 1.466. Looking at the options, the smallest z above that would be option D) 1.9, but wait, wait, option B is 1.2, which is below 1.466. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate: 3000 / 1216 ≈ 2.466. So 1 + z = 2.466 → z ≈ 1.466.

So the minimal redshift is when z is about 1.466. So any z above that would result in the Lyman alpha line being observed at wavelengths above 3000 A, which is in the near UV, but wait, the atmosphere doesn't transmit that either. Oh wait, atmospheric cutoff is about 3000 A (or 3100 A, depending on the source). So if the observed wavelength is exactly 3000 A, 1216*(1+z) = 3000 → z≈1.466.

But ground-based telescopes can't see wavelengths below about 3000 A. So the observed wavelength has to be longer than 3000 A to pass through the atmosphere. So the Lyman alpha line must have a wavelength longer than 3000 A. So 1216*(1+z) > 3000 → z > (3000/1216)-1 ≈ 1.466.

So the minimal redshift is about 1.466, so any object at z > 1.466 would have the Lyman alpha line observed at wavelengths above 3000 A, which can be observed by ground-based telescopes.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So 1216 * (1 + z) > 3000 → (1 + z) > 3000/1216 ≈ 2.466 → z > 1.466.

So the minimal z is approximately 1.466. So the lower limit is z ≈1.466. Looking at the options, the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the minimal z is around 1.466. So the lower limit would be any z above that. So the minimal z is about 1.466, so the next possible option is D)1.9.

Wait, but option B is 1.2, which is below 1.466. So the answer would be the minimal z is just above 1.466. So the options don't have exactly that, so the next higher is option D)1.9.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, but the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the quasar's light is coming through the cloud. So the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. But wait, in this question, the cloud is the object we're considering. So the cloud's redshift is what we're calculating.

Wait, but in the question, it's the cloud's redshift that's being considered. Because the cloud is absorbing the quasar's light. So the cloud must be between us and the quasar, so the quasar's redshift is higher than the cloud's. But the question is about the cloud's redshift, so the minimal z is the lower limit such that the Lyman alpha line is in the observable range.

So that minimal z is about 1.466. So any cloud with z higher than that would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical range.

Wait, but the options don't have 1.466. So the closest option is D) 1.9, which is higher than 1.466, so that would allow the Lyman alpha line to be observed in the optical.

But wait, another approach. Maybe I should consider that the Lyman alpha line is at 121.6 nm. The atmosphere's cutoff is about 300 nm (which is 3000 Angstroms). So any observed wavelength longer than 300 nm would be in the optical range that can pass through the atmosphere.

So 121.6 * (1 + z) = 300 nm → (1 + z) = 300 / 121.6 ≈ 2.466 → z ≈1.466.

So any cloud with z>1.466 would have the Lyman alpha line at longer than 300 nm, so it's in the optical range. So the minimal z is about 1.466, so the lower limit is z=1.466.

Looking at the options, the possible choices are 1.2, 1.9, etc. So the minimal z is approximately 1.466, so any z above that is acceptable. So the lower limit is 1.466, so the minimal z is just above that. So the answer would be the smallest option higher than 1.466, which is D) 1.9.

Wait, but wait, another angle: perhaps the question is considering that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical for detection. So the observed wavelength has to be in the range that optical telescopes can detect, which is up to around 700 nm (7000 Angstroms). So 1216*(1+z) needs to be less than 7000 A. Because higher than that would be in the infrared, which isn't the point for optical telescopes.

Wait, no, that's the opposite. Because when the redshift increases, the observed wavelength increases. So if the observed wavelength is longer than 700 nm (7000 A), it's in the infrared, which optical telescopes don't detect. So the observed wavelength needs to be between 4000 A (400 nm) and 7000 A (700 nm). Because that's the visible range.

So let me set it up again. The observed wavelength lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). For it to be in the optical range, lambda_obs must be >= 4000 A (if we're considering the lower end of optical as 400 nm) and <= 7000 A (700 nm).

So the range is 4000 <= 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

So (1+z) must be between 4000/1216 ≈3.29 and 7000/1216≈5.756.

So z between approximately 2.29 and 4.756.

So the minimal z is 2.29.

Wait, that's different from earlier. So earlier I thought the cutoff for the atmosphere is 3000 A (300 nm), but perhaps the correct approach is to have the observed wavelength within the visible spectrum, which is 4000-7000 A.

But then the minimal z is about 2.29. So looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above 2.29, and option D is 1.9, which is below. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is 2.29. So the correct answer would be the smallest z that is >=2.29. So the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So among these, the next is option C)2.4.

Hmm, but wait, why the confusion earlier? Because the question is about whether the Lyman-alpha absorption line can be detected with optical telescopes. The key is whether the observed wavelength is in the optical range (400-700 nm, which is 4000-7000 A). So we have to find the minimal z where 1216*(1+z) >=4000 A.

So 1 + z = 4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

Thus, the minimal redshift is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is z >=2.29. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimal z is just above that. The smallest option above 2.29 is C)2.4.

Wait, but wait another point. The Lyman-alpha forest refers to the absorption lines seen in the spectra of quasars, where intervening hydrogen clouds at various redshifts imprint absorption lines. These lines are observed in the optical range if their rest wavelength (1216 A) is redshifted into the visible.

So for the quasar's spectrum, the Lyman-alpha absorption line would appear blueward (shorter wavelength) of the quasar's emission line. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the quasar emits in the UV, but when observed from Earth, if the quasar is at high redshift, its emission lines are redshifted into the optical. But in this case, the absorption is due to intervening clouds, which are at lower redshifts than the quasar.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me clarify.

When a quasar is at a high redshift (z_Q), and there's a cloud of hydrogen at a lower redshift (z_cloud < z_Q), the cloud will absorb the quasar's light at a wavelength that is redshifted according to its own z. So the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption is 1216*(1+z_cloud).

So to be observed in the optical (say, 4000-7000 A), we have 4000 <= 1216*(1+z_cloud) <=7000.

Which gives z_cloud >= (4000/1216)-1 ≈ 2.29, and z_cloud <= (7000/1216)-1≈4.75.

So the lower limit on z_cloud is approximately 2.29.

So the minimal redshift is about 2.29, which isn't an option provided. The closest higher option is C)2.4.

Wait, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the correct answer would be option C)2.4.

But wait, another consideration: perhaps the quasar's emission lines are at higher redshifts, but the absorption line we're seeing is from the cloud. So the cloud's redshift is such that its Lyman alpha line is in the optical. So the same calculation applies.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking the lower redshift (i.e., the minimal z) such that the cloud's Lyman alpha line is in the optical. So with z_cloud = 2.29.

But the options don't have exactly that, so the answer would be the next higher option, which is C)2.4.

Wait, but what about the atmosphere cutoff? If the observed wavelength needs to be longer than 3000 A (300 nm) to pass through the atmosphere, then the calculation was (3000)/(1216)=2.466, so z_cloud =1.466. So any cloud at z>1.466 would have the Lyman alpha line in the optical. So the minimal z is 1.466, so the lower limit is z>1.466.

But then, the options have D)1.9 which is above 1.466, so that would work.

Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought the cutoff is 3000 A, not 4000 A.

So which is correct? The atmosphere's cutoff is about 3000 A. So to observe the Lyman alpha line, the observed wavelength must be longer than 3000 A. Because below that, the atmosphere absorbs it.

So 1216*(1+z_cloud) >3000 → z_cloud> (3000/1216)-1 ≈1.466.

So the minimal z_cloud is 1.466. So the lower limit is z_cloud>1.466.

Looking at the options, the smallest option above that is D)1.9.

So the answer should be D)1.9.

But earlier I thought the optical range starts at 4000 A. Hmm, perhaps I was mistaken in the initial assumption.

Wait, the atmospheric transmission window. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below about 3100 A (310 nm) due to the ozone layer. So wavelengths longer than 310 nm can pass through. So the Lyman alpha line observed must be longer than 310 nm to be detected.

So 1216*(1 + z_cloud) > 3100 A → 1+z_cloud >3100/1216≈2.55 → z_cloud>1.55.

So the minimal z_cloud is about 1.55. So the lower limit is z_cloud>1.55.

Looking at the options, the next higher is D)1.9.

So the answer would be D)1.9.

Wait, but why did I get 2.29 earlier? Because I thought the optical range starts at 4000 A, but perhaps that's not the case. The atmosphere blocks everything below ~3000 A, so the observed wavelength must be above that.

So if the observed wavelength is just above 3000 A, say 3000 A, then 1216*(1+z)=3000 → z= (3000/1216)-1 ≈1.466.

So the minimal redshift is approximately 1.466. So the lower limit is any z_cloud>1.466.

The options are:

A)3 → z=3 is way higher.

B)1.2 → below 1.466 → can't be detected.

C)2.4 → higher than 1.466 → can be detected.

D)1.9 → higher than 1.466 → can be detected.

The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z_cloud is around 1.466. So the lower limit is that any cloud with z>1.466 would have the Lyman alpha line in the detectable range.

So the options that are possible are C and D. But the question is about the lower limit. So the minimal z is approximately 1.466. The options that are above this are D)1.9 and C)2.4. The smallest among them is D)1.9.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift, which is the minimal z. So the answer is the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is observed at just above 3000 A, which is 1.466. So any z above that is acceptable. So the lower limit is 1.466, so the minimal z is 1.466.

Looking at the options, B is 1.2, which is below, so it's not acceptable. D is 1.9, which is above 1.466. So the lower limit must be 1.466, but since the options don't have it, the next higher is D)1.9.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the lower limit on the redshift of this objects." So the minimal z is 1.466, so any z above that would allow detection. So the minimal redshift is 1.466, so the lower limit is 1.466. So the possible answers are the options with z >=1.466.

So the answer would be the smallest option that is >=1.466.

Looking at the options, D)1.9 is the smallest option that's above 1.466.

So the correct answer is D)1.9.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of large clouds of neutral hydrogen such that their Lyman alpha absorption line (~1216 Å) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshift requirements.

The Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Å is in the ultraviolet range and cannot be observed directly by ground-based telescopes due to atmospheric absorption. However, if the cloud is at a high redshift, the absorption line is redshifted into the optical range. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to wavelengths below approximately 3000 Å (300 nm), so the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line must be greater than 3000 Å for it to be detectable.

The relationship between the rest wavelength ($\lambda_{\text{rest}}$), the observed wavelength ($\lambda_{\text{obs}}$), and the redshift ($z$) is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

To ensure the observed wavelength is greater than 3000 Å:

\[
1216 \cdot (1 + z) > 3000
\]

Solving for $z$:

\[
1 + z > \frac{3000}{1216} \approx 2.466 \quad \Rightarrow \quad z > 1.466
\]

Thus, the minimal redshift for the Lyman alpha line to be detectable is approximately $z \approx 1.466$. Any cloud with a redshift greater than this value will have its Lyman alpha line redshifted into the optical range.

From the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is significantly higher than the minimal redshift and is acceptable but not the lower limit.
- **B) 1.2**: This is below the minimal redshift of 1.466 and cannot detect the Lyman alpha line in the optical range.
- **C) 2.4**: This is above the minimal redshift and is acceptable.
- **D) 1.9**: This is above the minimal redshift and is the smallest option that satisfies the condition.

The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift, which corresponds to the smallest redshift value that allows detection. Among the options, **D) 1.9** is the closest value above the minimal redshift of 1.466 and thus represents the lower limit.

Answer: D
