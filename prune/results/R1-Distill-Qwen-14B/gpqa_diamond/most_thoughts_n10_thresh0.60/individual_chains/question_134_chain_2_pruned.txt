Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are given. I remember that when acids and bases neutralize each other, they produce water and salt, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic, which means it's negative, releasing heat.

Wait, but wait—Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? And HCl is a strong acid. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. Oh right, the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be, but in aqueous solution, especially when heated, it does dissociate.

But wait, when mixing these, the neutralization reaction will involve the H+ ions from the acids and the OH- ions from the base. So I need to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- to see which is in excess.

Let me break down each solution:

First, HCl: 500 mL of 0.2 M. Moles of HCl is Molarity multiplied by Volume in liters. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely, so that's 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Sulfuric acid is diprotic, so each molecule gives 2 H+ ions. Moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since it's a strong acid, both H+ ions will dissociate. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Then Ba(OH)2: 200 mL of 0.5 M. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. OH- ions would be 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. Total OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, so H+ is more than OH-. So the excess H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But wait, does that mean that the reaction goes to completion with OH- being the limiting reagent, and some H+ remains?

But how does this affect the enthalpy calculation? Because the neutralization enthalpy depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

In neutralization, the reaction is typically H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases energy. The enthalpy change per mole is usually around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases
