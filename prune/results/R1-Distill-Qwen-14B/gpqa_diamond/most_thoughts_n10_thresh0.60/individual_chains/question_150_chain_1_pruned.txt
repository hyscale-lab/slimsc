Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question gives a molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it describes a series of reactions using specific reagents, and we have to determine the final product from the options.

First, let's parse the molecular formula. C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting:

(2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), maybe an amine group (but wait, the formula has O and N. So the molecule has one N and one O.

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group?

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Downfield, so aromatic protons. A doublet. Maybe part of a para-substituted benzene, like two protons in a para arrangement.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, maybe the other set of aromatic protons. If the first is 6.98 (d, 2H), and this is 6.51 (d, 2H), maybe two sets of doublets in a para-substituted ring. So that could be two substituents on a benzene ring, each with two protons as doublets. Like a 1,4-dichlorobenzene, but here the substituents are probably something else.

Wait, but wait, the NMR also shows 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, maybe two protons. Could be -OH groups? Or maybe some other protons. Alternatively, maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like a phenol ring, but the broadness might suggest exchange with D2O, but I'm not sure.

3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet for two protons. Probably a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom like O or N. Since the molecular formula includes an O, maybe an ether or ester group. Or perhaps an amino group, but amine protons are usually broad and around 1-5 ppm, but this is 3.66, which is a bit higher, but maybe it's a CH2 next to an oxygen.

Putting this together: the NMR suggests the presence of an aldehyde group
