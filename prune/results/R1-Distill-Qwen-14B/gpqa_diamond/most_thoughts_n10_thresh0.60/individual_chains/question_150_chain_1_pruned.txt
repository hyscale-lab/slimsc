Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let's see, the degrees of unsaturation can help me figure out the structure. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. Five degrees of unsaturation. That means five rings, double bonds, or triple bonds. Since most organic compounds have a few, maybe a benzene ring (which is 3) and the rest from other double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data, let's try to interpret that. The 1H NMR shows the following peaks:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7 ppm. High upfield, but wait, actually, 9.7 is pretty downfield. Maybe an aldehyde proton? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as singlets or maybe triplets if coupled with something. Wait, but it's a triplet, so maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to another proton. Hmm.
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. That might be part of an aromatic ring, maybe para-substituted. Like a para-disubstituted benzene, so each substituent is in the para position. For example, if there are two substituents across from each other, each H would couple with the adjacent ones, leading to a doublet. Or maybe it's part of a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, but that seems less likely.
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, two protons. Maybe another part of an aromatic ring. Let me think, if we have two substituents on a benzene, perhaps in the para positions, their protons would split into doublets. But wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be for two separate aromatic rings. Or maybe one is a substituent on another structure.
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange with a proton, like an -OH group nearby, but it's a singlet. Could this be a di-substituted aromatic ring with some symmetry, or perhaps a conjugated diene? Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group next to an oxygen, like an enol structure.
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet with two protons. This region is typical for protons adjacent to an oxygen, like CH2O. Maybe a methylene group next to an oxygen, like in an ether or an aldehyde attached to a CH2.

Putting this together, let's think about possible structures. The molecular formula includes an oxygen and a nitrogen. So maybe an amine? But in NMR, I don't see a peak that would correspond to an amine. Alternatively, perhaps the N is
