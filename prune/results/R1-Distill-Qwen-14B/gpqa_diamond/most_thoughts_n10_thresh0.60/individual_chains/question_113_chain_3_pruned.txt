Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying a compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the functional groups detected by FTIR. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H stretching, probably from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a very broad peak might be more indicative of an alcohol, since carboxylic acids have a broader but sometimes lower wavenumber? Or maybe it's an -OH group in something else. Oh wait, a broad peak at 3000 is often alcohols or maybe even a carbonyl group, but no, the carbonyl peaks are at higher wavenumbers. So O-H is more likely. So maybe an alcohol or perhaps a phenol. Alternatively, maybe a ketone? No, no, ketones have strong peaks around 1700, but wait the 1700 and 1650 in the IR are probably carbonyl groups.

Wait, the IR shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, 1700 is a strong carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester or aldehyde. The 1650 is a bit lower, which might be an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps an amide? No, because the options don't have N. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta
