Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says. It's about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques. Hmm, I remember that each technique gives specific information about the structure.

The question lists the techniques as FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each is given. Let me break it down.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Oh right, that broad peak is usually from O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak might indicate hydrogen bonding, which is more common in either -OH groups from alcohols or maybe ketones? Wait, no, ketones don't have O-H. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group, but the broad peak is O-H. So, the compound likely has an -OH group or maybe a carbonyl.

Looking further, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a strong peak. I think that's a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, but maybe conjugated. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds? Wait, the 1650 might be an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Or perhaps an amide, but I don't see any info on N here. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or a ketone next to something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the structure must have a double bond, probably an alkene. So maybe an ester with an alkene, or a ketone with an alkene, or a carboxylic acid with an alkene.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm a bit fuzzy on mass spec, but m/z 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2CH3? Wait, no, that's (15+32) for ester
