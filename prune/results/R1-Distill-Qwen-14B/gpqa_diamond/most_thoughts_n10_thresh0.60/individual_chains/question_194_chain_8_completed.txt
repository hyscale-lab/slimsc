Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, right.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

Each spin has two possible states, so three spins make 2^3 = 8 possible states. That's manageable. Let me list them all.

Let me think about how to represent each state. Each spin is either +1 or -1. So I'll list all possible combinations:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Okay, so 8 states in total.

Now, for each state, I need to compute E. Let's compute the term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each.

Let's go step by step.

State 1: All +1.

S1S2 = (+1)(+1) = 1
S1S3 = (+1)(+1) = 1
S2S3 = (+1)(+1) = 1
Sum = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
E = -J * 3 = -3J

State 2: S3 is -1.

S1S2 = 1*1=1
S1S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J

State 3: S2 is -1.

S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1
S1S3 = 1*(1) = 1
S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1
E = J

State4: S2 and S3 are -1.

S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1
S1S3 = 1*(-1)=-1
S2S3 = (-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E = J

State5: S1 is -1, others +1.

S1S2 = (-1)*1 =-1
S1S3 = (-1)*1 =-1
S2S3 = 1*1 =1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E = J

State6: S1 and S3 are -1.

S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1
S1S3 = (-1)*(-1)=1
S2S3 = 1*(-1)=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1
E = J

State7: S1 and S2 are -1, S3 +1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1) =1
S1S3 = (-1)(1) =-1
S2S3 = (-1)(1) =-1
Sum:1 -1 -1 =-1
E= J

State8: All -1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1) =1
S1S3 = (-1)(-1)=1
S2S3 = (-1)(-1)=1
Sum:1+1+1=3
E= -J *3 =-3J

Wait, let's count. For each state, how many have E=-3J, and how many have E=J.

Looking through the states:

Only State1 and State8 have E=-3J. The other 6 states have E=J.

So, the total partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

So, for states 1 and 8: exp(-β * (-3J)) = exp(3Jβ). Each contributes this, so 2 terms of exp(3Jβ).

For the other 6 states: exp(-β * J) = exp(-Jβ). Each contributes this, so 6 terms of exp(-Jβ).

So Z = 2 * exp(3Jβ) + 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Wait a minute, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ}
No, because we have exp(3Jβ) and exp(-Jβ).

Option B) Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}
Yes, that matches. So B is the correct answer.

Hmm, but wait. Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check.

Wait, E is given as E = -J (S1S2 + ...). So when S1S2 + ... =3, then E= -3J. So for that, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-β E) = exp(3Jβ). So that's correct.

The other cases have E= J. So exp(-β * J) = exp(-Jβ). So 6 of these.

Yes, so the partition function is 2 exp(3Jβ) +6 exp(-Jβ). So the correct option is B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), each of which can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start by considering the energy of the system, given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state corresponds to a specific combination of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). The energy \( E \) for each state is computed as follows:

1. **State 1**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, \quad E = -3J.
   \]

2. **State 2**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1, \quad E = J.
   \]

3. **State 3**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1, \quad E = J.
   \]

4. **State 4**: \( S_1 = +1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1, \quad E = J.
   \]

5. **State 5**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = +1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1, \quad E = J.
   \]

6. **State 6**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = +1, S_3 = -1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 + 1 - 1 = -1, \quad E = J.
   \]

7. **State 7**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = +1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1, \quad E = J.
   \]

8. **State 8**: \( S_1 = -1, S_2 = -1, S_3 = -1 \)  
   \[
   S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, \quad E = -3J.
   \]

From the above, two states (States 1 and 8) have \( E = -3J \), and the remaining six states have \( E = J \). The partition function is then:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (Incorrect, as the exponents are reversed).  
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (Correct, matches the derived result).  
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, incorrect exponents).  
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (Incorrect, incorrect coefficients and exponents).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
