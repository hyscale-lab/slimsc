Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titration of acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. Right, so when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, you form the acetate ion, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. 

The problem states: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should figure out the initial concentrations after dilution. Let me compute that. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid are volume (L) times molarity. So 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, so 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles of CH3COOH.

After dilution, the concentration will be moles over total volume. Total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid to form the acetate ion.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence. The moles of acetic acid are 0.001 as before. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. Let me tackle each part step by step.

First, 25% titration. That means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH. 

But wait, another way: perhaps it's 25% of the equivalence point volume. Hmm, since the equivalence is at 10 cm³, 25% of that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So that's 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M NaOH = 0.25 mmol. Wait, but let me think again. The initial
