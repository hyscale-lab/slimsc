Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that's been dehydrated to an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NMR data is key here, especially the NOESY spectrum.

First, let's break down the starting materials. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. Since the starting alkene is cis, the resulting anhydride would have a structure where the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons in a ring, probably a five-membered ring because that's common for anhydrides.

Then, the anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. A peak around 7 ppm in 1H NMR usually corresponds to aromatic protons or possibly an alpha proton adjacent to an carbonyl group. But wait, this is for a non-aromatic compound. Alternatively, it could be a proton near an electron-withdrawing group, but maybe it's something else. Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbon chemical shifts: 137 is around where a CH adjacent to an oxygen might be (like a carbonyl), and 165 is likely a carbonyl carbon (like an anhydride or ester group). Also, since the 1H NMR has a single peak, maybe it's a CH group that's symmetrical.

Wait, but wait. The anhydride would have a structure like a cyclopentane ring with two carbonyl groups. Let's think: a five-membered ring with two double bonds? Or maybe an anhydride forms a five-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. So the structure would be something like O=C-O-C-O=C, but that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, an an
