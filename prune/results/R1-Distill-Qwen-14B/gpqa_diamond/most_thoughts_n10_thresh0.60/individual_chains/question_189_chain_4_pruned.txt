Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I remember from my studies that symmetry breaking has to do with when a system's symmetry is not evident in its lowest energy state. And particles like phonons, magnons, skyrmions, and pions are involved in various physical contexts.

Let me think about each option. Phononsâ€”those are quantized sound waves, right? They're related to the vibrations in a crystal lattice. I think they arise from the quantization of the lattice vibrations, which are part of the solid's structure. But does that have to do with symmetry breaking? Symmetry breaking often happens in phases of matter, like how a crystal breaks translational symmetry compared to a liquid. So phonons might be a result of a broken symmetry because the crystal has a specific structure with phonons as its quasiparticles.

Skyrmions are a bit trickier. I remember they're topological solitons, originally proposed in the context of nuclear physics by Skyrme. They're also found in magnetism, like in certain magnetic materials. Skyrmions arise from the symmetry properties of the system, and their existence is a result of the symmetry structure of the underlying theory. So the presence of skyrmions might indicate a symmetry that's been spontaneously broken. Wait, or is it the other way around? I think symmetry breaking allows for the existence of such solitons. So skyrmions are associated with broken symmetry.

Magnons are the quasiparticles representing the quantized spin waves in a magnetically ordered system. Like how in a ferromagnet, the spins align, and any deviation from that ordered state can be described by magnons. So here, the magnetic order breaks the symmetry of the system (like rotational symmetry in the magnetization direction), so magnons are linked to the broken symmetry.

Pions are the lightest mesons, made of up and down quarks. I remember that in the early universe, the strong interaction had a symmetry called chiral symmetry. At high temperatures, this symmetry was unbroken, but as the universe cooled, it spontaneously broke. The pions are the Goldstone bosons resulting from this symmetry breaking. So pions are directly associated with chiral symmetry breaking in QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics).

Wait, the question is asking which particle is NOT associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. So I need to find the one that doesn't come from symmetry breaking.

Phonons come from the broken translational symmetry in solids. Magnons from broken magnetic symmetry. Pions from chiral symmetry breaking. Skyrmions are a result of symmetry considerations but are they related to broken symmetry? Or do they form due to the existence of a symmetry that's unbroken?

Wait, Skyrmions are solutions in theories where the symmetry is intact but there's a nonlinear realization. Or perhaps they emerge from the symmetry breaking. Hmm, I might be getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the phonon is a boson, and it's a Goldstone mode if it arises from a broken symmetry. But in the case of phonons, the symmetry breaking is from the crystalline structure. So the phonon is a Goldstone boson for the broken translational symmetry.

Wait, but phonons are different from Goldstone bosons. Goldstone's theorem says that for each continuous symmetry broken, you get a mass
