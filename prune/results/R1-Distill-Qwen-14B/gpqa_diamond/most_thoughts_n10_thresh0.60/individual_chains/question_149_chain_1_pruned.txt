Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the problem is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR shows some inconsistencies, and the LC-MS data also has some interesting peaks. I need to figure out what's causing these observations.

First, let me restate what's given. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly okay except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we expect. So, the integral suggests that it's just one proton, but split into two peaks. But wait, the question says we can rule out spin-spin coupling because of the coupling pattern. So, it's not something like a doublet of doublets from coupling with two different protons.

Hmm, so what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Maybe some kind of isomerism? Enantiomers or diastereomers? Or maybe something else happened during synthesis, like a side reaction.

Looking at the LC-MS data, the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum as expected. So, the mass is correct, but there are two peaks. Since the mass is the same, it's not a fragment or a different moleculeâ€”like maybe a dimer or something else. But the question says both have the same mass spectrum, which suggests they are the same compound but in different forms.

Wait, if the mass is the same and it's a peptidic compound, maybe it's a mixture of diastereomers or enantiomers. But how do enantiomers and diastereomers affect LC-MS and NMR?

In NMR, enantiomers would be identical because in a racemic mixture, the environment for each proton is the same, so you wouldn't see splitting unless there's something else. Wait, but in an enantiomer, the same proton would experience the same environment, so the NMR wouldn't show splitting. Wait, but then why are the NMR peaks split?

Wait, but in the NMR, the two peaks for the same alpha proton. Since coupling is ruled out, maybe it's because the protons are in different environments. But if the molecule is a racemic mixture, then in the
