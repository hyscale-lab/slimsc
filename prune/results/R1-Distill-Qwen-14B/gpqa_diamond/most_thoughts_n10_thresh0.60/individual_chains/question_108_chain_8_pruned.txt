Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The given parameters are that the magnetic field B is 1 Tesla and is parallel to the Oz axis. Also, it's mentioned that m is small, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. The wavelength of the transition is λ = 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, wait, 0.4861 micrometers is the wavelength for the Lyman alpha emission, right? That's the Balmer series transition from n=2 to n=1 in hydrogen. So the energy ΔE would be the energy difference between these two levels.

First, I need to calculate the transition energy ΔE. I remember the formula for the energy levels of a hydrogen atom is given by E_n = - (m_e e^4)/(8ε_0²h²) * (1/n²), where m_e is the electron mass, e is the elementary charge, ε_0 is the vacuum permittivity, h is Planck's constant, and n is the principal quantum number.

Alternatively, I can use the Rydberg formula to find the energy difference. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 13.6 eV, so for a transition from n=2 to n=1, the energy ΔE should be E_2 - E_1. Since E_n is negative, going from a higher n to a lower n (emission) would release energy. So E_1 is more negative than E_2. The energy difference would be E_2 - E_1 = (-13.6 eV/4) - (-13.6 eV) )= ( -3.4 +13.6 ) eV = 10.2 eV.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me think again. Because when n increases, the energy becomes less negative. So from n=2 to n=1, the energy goes from -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV to -13.6 eV. So the energy difference is ΔE = E_final - E_initial. Since it's emission, the electron drops from n=2 to n=1, so E_initial is -3.4 eV and E_final is -13.6 eV. So ΔE = (-13.6) - (-3.4) ) = -10.2 eV. But since energy is positive when emitted, I think we take the absolute value, so 10.2 eV.

Okay, so ΔE is 10.2 eV. But I'm not sure if I should double-check that calculation. Wait, another way to find ΔE is using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters.

Plugging in, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = let's calculate that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.089e-19 J.

Now, to convert J to eV. Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E = (4.089e-19) / (1.602e-19) ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, that's different from 10.2 eV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Oh wait, wait. The Rydberg formula gives the energy difference between two levels, but when using wavelength, it's the photon energy that's emitted. Let me check the Rydberg formula again.

The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R (1/1² - 1/2²) = R (1 - 1/4) = (3/4) R.

R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. So 1/λ = (3/4)*1.097e4 = approx 8.23e3 m^-1. So λ = 1/(8.23e3) ≈ 1.215e-4 meters, which is about 121.5 nm, which is the Lyman alpha line. Wait, but the given λ here is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm, that's the Balmer alpha, which is the H-alpha line, which is the transition from n=3 to n=2, not n=2 to n=1. Oh! So I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, okay, the problem says the wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. That's the H-alpha
