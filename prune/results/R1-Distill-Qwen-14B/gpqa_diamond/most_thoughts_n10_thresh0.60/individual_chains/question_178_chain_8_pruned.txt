Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants determines renormalizability. Right, renormalizable theories have coupling constants with non-negative mass dimensions. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the mass dimension of the coupling constants must be ≥ the number of fields minus 4, or something like that. Wait, maybe I should think about the general approach.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], which is an antisymmetric tensor of γ matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, since that's how it's written.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ℏ=c=1). So the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4. So let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Let me recall the mass dimensions of the fields. Spinor fields ψ have mass dimension (4-1)/2 = 3/2. Because for a Dirac field, the Lagrangian is something like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which must have dimension 4. So each ψ is dimension 3/2, since ∂_μ has dimension 1.

F^{μν} is the field strength, which is ∂_μ A^ν - ∂_ν A^μ. But A^μ is a gauge field, which has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term is (1/4) F^2, and F has dimension 2 (because each derivative is 1, and A is 1, so F is ∂A, which is 1+1=2). So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from γ matrices. The γ matrices are dimensionless, I think. So σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices (since it's a commutator, which is antisymmetric), so it's like a tensor made from γ's. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ is ψ^† γ^0 σ ψ. Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ would have dimension (3/2) + (3/2) =3.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + 0 (since σ is dimensionless) + (3/2) = 3. Then multiplied by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F would have dimension 3 +
