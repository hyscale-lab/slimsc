Alright, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, let's try to work through it. Okay, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each serially diluted sample. The efficiency was 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect—each cycle doubles the target. The R² was 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly, right? Slope was -3.3, which is typical for qPCR. I think the slope is related to efficiency; a slope of -3.322 would be for 100% efficiency. So that checks out.

Looking at his results: For each concentration, the CT values are increasing as the copy number decreases. That makes sense because lower starting amounts take more cycles to reach detection. So at 100,000 copies, the CTs are around 33-34, which is higher than at 10 copies, which is around 20-21. That's the expected trend.

Wait, but the question is about discrepancies in his results. The options are suggesting something's wrong. Let me read the options again.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But that's not true because he's using it for quantification with a standard curve. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with target amount. But his R² is 1, meaning the curve fits perfectly. So B doesn't make sense because the data is consistent.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Hmm. Each ten-fold dilution should change the CT by about 3.3 cycles, because with 100% efficiency, each dilution would decrease the CT by log2(10) which is roughly 3.32. So if you go from 10000 to 1000 copies, that's a ten-fold dilution. The CT should go up by about 3.3 (since lower starting amount would take more cycles). Let's look at the data:

At 10000, the average CT is about 30.8 (30.6, 30.9, 31.2). At 1000, it's about 27.5 (27.3, 27.6, 27.9). The difference is 3.3 cycles. Similarly, 100000 to 10000: 33.9 average vs 30.8, difference is 3.1. Close enough, considering possible minor variations.

Wait the slope is -3.3, which aligns with the 10-fold dilution causing a 3.3 increase in CT. So that seems okay. So why is this an issue? Hmm, the question says there are discrepancies. Oh wait, maybe the data doesn't align with the expected 3.3 cycles per ten-fold.

Wait the data: Let's compute the differences.

100000: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → avg ≈34.2.

10000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2 → avg≈30.9.

Difference is 34.2 -30.9 =3.3. So that's exactly the 3.3 cycle change for a 10-fold dilution.

Next: 10000 to 1000: 30.9 to 27.5. Difference is 3.4. Close enough, considering measurement error. 1000 to 100: 27.5 to 24.3? Wait, the 100 copies have CTs 24, 24.3, 24.6 → avg 24.3. So 27.5 -24.3=3.2. Also around 3.3.

100 to 10: 24.3 to 20.7 (avg). 24.3 -20.7=3.6. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 3.3.

Wait, so each ten-fold dilution should change the CT by about 3.3 cycles. Here, between 100 and 10, the change is 3.6 cycles. So option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. But wait, in this case, the change is about 3.6, which is more than 3.3. So that's a discrepancy. So the data doesn't fit perfectly with the expected 3.3 cycles per ten-fold. But why is that an issue?

Wait, but the efficiency was 100%, so the slope should
