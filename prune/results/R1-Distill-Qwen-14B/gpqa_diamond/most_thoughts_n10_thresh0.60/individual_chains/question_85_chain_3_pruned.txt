Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets are detected via transit and radial velocity methods, so they must be causing Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum.

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo. They’re in circular orbits. The shifts given are for the [OI] forbidden line at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift, Planet2 a 0.04 Å shift. Wait, but how does that relate to the planets' masses or distances?

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's motion caused by the planet's gravity. The shift depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period, I think. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) )) * (1 / (1 day) )? Maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula here. Alternatively, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be approximated by K = ( (2πG) / (c T) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )^(1/3)), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the relation between K, planet mass, and orbital distance.

Wait, but in this question, both planets are detected via RV, so the shifts given (0.03 and 0.04 Å) are the semi-amplitudes for the RV method. Since the same spectral line is being observed, the Doppler shift tells us about the velocity of the star due to the planet.

Wait, the Doppler shift
