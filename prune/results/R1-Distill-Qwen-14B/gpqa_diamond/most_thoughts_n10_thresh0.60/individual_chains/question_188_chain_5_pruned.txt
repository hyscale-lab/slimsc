Okay, so I have this question about a rhombohedral crystal and the interplanar distance of a specific plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. All the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, wait. I remember that interplanar distance d is calculated using a formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), but that's when the angles are not all the same. Wait, is that correct? Or am I mixing it up with something else?

Wait, no. I think the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice vectors a, b, c and angles between them is given by the inverse of the square root of the sum of squares of the Miller indices, but adjusted for the angles. Oh, right, the formula is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2 hk cos γ - 2 hl cos β - 2 kl cos α ) ) multiplied by some factor involving the lattice constants. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between the reciprocal and the actual distance.

Alternatively, I think for a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles
