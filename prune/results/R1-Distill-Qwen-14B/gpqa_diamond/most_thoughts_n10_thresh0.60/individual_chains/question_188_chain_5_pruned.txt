Okay, so I've got this problem about rhombohedral crystals and interplanar distances. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says the crystal is rhombohedral, with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance... isn't that the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice? So in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a cube that's been distorted so all the edges are the same length (a, let's say) but the angles between them are equal and not 90 degrees. In this case, those angles are 30 degrees each.

But wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. So that must be the lattice parameter 'a' of the rhombohedral structure, right? Because in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the vertices, so the distance between adjacent atoms is 'a' along the edges.

So a = 10 Angstroms.

Now, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. For a crystal plane (hkl), the interplanar distance d is given by the formula:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (h² sin² α + k² sin² β + l² sin² γ)/(a² (1 + cos α cos β cos γ - (cos α sin β sin γ + cos beta sin gamma sin alpha) ... )) Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Maybe I'm mixing up formulas.

Wait, another approach. For a rhombohedral system, there's a specific formula for the interplanar distance. I think the formula for d_hkl is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, but in a rhombohedral structure, all the angles are equal, α = β = γ = θ (which is 30 degrees here). So maybe the formula simplifies.

Let me look this up in my notes. Oh right, in a rhombo
