Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and is directed radially. The sphere has radius R. I need to find which option is correct.

Wait, so the vector field is radial, right? That means it only has a component in the radial direction. So f(r) is a vector pointing away from the origin, and its magnitude is 1/r². So in spherical coordinates, the vector field would look like f(r) = (1/r²) * e_r, where e_r is the unit radial vector.

The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of f. So I need to find ∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere of radius R.

I remember from my notes that there's a divergence theorem which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary. But wait, the divergence theorem says that ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS, where n is the outward normal vector and the integral is over the surface of the volume. So in this case, the volume is a sphere, so the surface integral would be over the sphere's surface.

But wait, maybe I can compute the divergence first and then integrate it. Let's think about how to compute ∇ · f. For a vector field in spherical coordinates, the divergence is given by (1/(r
