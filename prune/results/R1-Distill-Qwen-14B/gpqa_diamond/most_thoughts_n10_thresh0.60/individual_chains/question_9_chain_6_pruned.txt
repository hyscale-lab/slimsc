Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about symmetry in molecules. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry has to do with certain types of symmetry elements. Let me think about what C3h actually means.

Wait, right. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C' stands for a proper rotation axis, and the subscript '3' means it's a threefold rotation. The 'h' indicates that there's a horizontal mirror plane present. So, the molecule must have a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Now, looking at the options provided, I need to figure out which molecule fits this symmetry. The options are triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-trifuran compound, and another triphenyleno-trifuran compound.

I think I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene sounds like a fused ring system, maybe with three benzene rings or something similar. Trifuran suggests three furan rings connected. I'm not too sure about the structure, but I can imagine that if it's a symmetric arrangement of rings, maybe it has higher symmetry. But I'm not sure if it has a mirror plane and a threefold axis.

Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo implies a benzene ring fused with something. Trifuran again, so maybe three furan rings connected. The numbering might suggest a certain arrangement. I'm trying to picture this. If the molecule has threefold symmetry, when you rotate it 120 degrees, it should look the same. Also, a horizontal mirror plane would require that each part of the molecule is mirrored across that plane.

Option C: Triisopropyl borate. The structure of triisopropyl borate is a borate with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are bulky and symmetrical. So the molecule would have a trigonal structure around the boron. So it's probably trigonal planar. Does it have a threefold rotation axis? Yes, since all three substituents are the same and arranged symmetrically. But wait, what about the mirror plane? If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane might be present. So maybe C3h symmetry.

Option D: Quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, specifically a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system. I remember that quinuclidine has a threefold axis of symmetry because the molecule can be rotated 120 degrees and look the same. Wait, no, actually, I think quinuclidine has a threefold rotation axis. Let me think: the structure is a bridge bicyclic compound where rotating around the central axis by 120 degrees would cycle the substituents. But does it have a mirror plane? I'm not so sure. The molecule is symmetric, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a different symmetry.

Wait, but I think that quinuclidine has a threefold axis but lacks a mirror plane, or perhaps the mirror is not horizontal. Alternatively, maybe the mirror plane is vertical, which wouldn't fit the C3h symmetry. Because C3h requires a horizontal mirror plane. So whether the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane is crucial.

So, let's recap. C3h symmetry requires a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule must look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a plane that reflects it onto itself in that orientation.

Looking at each option again:

Triisopropyl borate (Option C): The molecule has a trigonal planar arrangement around boron. So, the three isopropyl groups are arranged at 120 degrees. If the boron is at the center, the molecule has a threefold rotation axis. Also, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would pass through the boron. Wait, but the structure is trigonal planar, which is in a plane. So any mirror plane that includes the central atom (boron) and is perpendicular to the plane would not be horizontal. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the orientation.

Wait, the molecule being planar would
