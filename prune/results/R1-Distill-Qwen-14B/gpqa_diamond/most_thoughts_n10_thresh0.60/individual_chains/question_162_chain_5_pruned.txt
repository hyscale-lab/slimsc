Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

First, the metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of spaces, like spheres or hyperboloids depending on the form. The denominator here is 4 - x² - y². Oh wait, that's similar to the metric for a sphere, where the denominator would have (r² - x² - y²), right? But wait, in this case, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², so r² would be 4, so r=2. Oh, right, because 4 is 2 squared. So this might be a metric describing a sphere of radius 2.

But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh, wait, no, a pseudosphere is a term I think is sometimes used for a hyperboloid of one sheet, which has negative curvature. Or maybe it's a term for a sphere in anti-de Sitter space? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. So I need to think about what this metric represents.

Wait, let's analyze the metric. The line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me see
