Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem is about a star's effective temperature and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots versus when it does.

Hmm, let me break down the given information. The star normally has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The key part here is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find out the factor by which this ratio changes.

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann equation in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But in this case, when the star has spots, the effective temperature is lower. So, the temperature used in the exponent would change. Let me think: when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, the effective temperature of the photosphere as a whole is lower.

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler regions. Do they affect the overall photospheric temperature? Or is the Teff a weighted average of the spotted and unspotted areas?

Actually, the way the problem states it is that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, the photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. But do the spots themselves have a lower temperature? I think so. Spots are darker and cooler, so when spots cover part of the surface, the average emitted flux decreases, hence lower effective temperature.

But how does this affect the excitation of atoms in the photosphere? The photosphere should still be in LTE, so each region (spot and non-spot) is in its own LTE. But when looking at the overall photosphere, perhaps we're considering an average temperature that's lower. Alternatively, maybe the star's photosphere on the unspotted regions is still at 6000 K, and the spots are much cooler. But the problem says that the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K when spots are present. So maybe the entire photosphere is considered to be at 5500 K then?

Wait, but that doesn't make much sense physically. Spots are cooler regions, and the rest is hotter. So the star's total flux would be a combination of the hotter and cooler regions. So the effective temperature is lower when spots are present because a significant fraction of the surface is emitting less flux.

But for the purposes of this problem, I think we can model the effect as the average temperature of the photosphere dropping from 6000 K to 5500 K. Because the question refers to the photospheric effective temperature as 5500 K when spots are present.

So, the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels depends on the temperature. Let me denote the levels as level 1 and level 2, with energies E1 and E2. Let’s say level 2 is higher in energy than level 1, so E2 > E1.

The ratio without spots (T1 = 6000 K) is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T1) )

With spots, the effective temperature is T2 = 5500 K. So the ratio becomes n2’/n1’ = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k*T2) )

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So (n2/n1) decreases when T decreases. Let's see: For higher energy levels, if T is lower, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 decreases.

So the initial ratio is R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), where ΔE= E2-E1.

When T changes to T2, the ratio R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Since T2 < T1, the exponent is more negative, so exp(...) is smaller, making R2 smaller than R1. So the ratio decreases, which aligns with the problem statement.

The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. So, factor = R1 / R2.

Let me compute R1/R2.

R1/R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k):

exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/T1 - 1/T2 ] )

Compute this exponent:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Wait, but I don't have the value of ΔE. Hmm, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. Let's think about that. The energy difference ΔE corresponds to the photon emitted when an electron transitions between these two levels. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ.

So, ΔE = hc/λ.

Let me compute ΔE/(k) for these values.

But wait, the units need to be consistent. Let me get the constants:

h is Planck's constant: 6.626e-34 J·s
c is speed of light: 3e8 m/s
λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.
k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) 

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = (1.9878 / 1448) * 1e-15 J.

Calculating 1.9878 / 1448 ≈ 0.001373 (since 1448 * 0.001373 ≈ ~2, but let me compute exact:

1448 * 0.001373 = 1448 * 1.373e-3 = (approx) 1.448e3 * 1.373e-3 = 1.448 * 1.373 = approx 2.  So 1.9878/1448 ≈ 0.001373, so 0.001373e-15 J.

Wait, maybe better to compute the exact value.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Multiply numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 /1.448 ) * 1e-18 J.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

Now, compute ΔE/(k) where k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

ΔE/k = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) 

= (1.373 / 1.38) * 1e5 K 

≈ (0.995) * 1e5 ≈ 9.95e4 K.

So approximately 1e5 K.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.373 / 1.38 = about 0.995 approx.

So 0.995e5 K ≈ 99,500 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

Now, plug into the exponent:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] 

= 99500 K * [ (1/6000 K) - (1/5500 K) ]

Compute 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667, 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182.

So 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515.

Multiply by 99500 K:

99500 * (-0.00001515) ≈ 

Let me compute 99500 * 0.00001515.

99500 = 1e5 approx. 1e5 * 0.00001515 = 1.515.

But 99500 is 0.995e5, so 0.995 * 1.515 ≈ 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately -1.505.

So exp( -1.505 ) ≈ e^(-1.505) ≈ 0.2214.

Wait, but wait: earlier I thought the ratio R1/R2 would be exp( [1/T1 - 1/T2 ] * ΔE/(k) )

Wait no, wait, the exponent was [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] * (ΔE/(k)).

Wait, no, earlier calculation:

The exponent was ΔE/(k) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

So, that's 99500 [ (1/6000) - (1/5500) ]

Which gave me about -1.505.

So exp( -1.505 ) is approximately 0.221.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the exact calculation.

Compute 1/6000 = 0.0001666667

1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818182

Subtract: 0.0001666667 - 0.0001818182 = -0.0000151515.

Multiply by 99500:

-0.0000151515 * 99500 = ?

Hmm, 0.0000151515 is 1.51515e-5.

Multiply by 99500: 1.51515e-5 * 99500 = 1.51515e-5 * 9.95e4 = 1.51515e-5 * 9.95e4 = (1.51515 *9.95)*1e-1.

Compute 1.51515 *9.95: ~15.06 (since 1.5 *10=15, and 0.01515*9.95 is about 0.15).

So 15.06 *0.1 = 1.506.

So the exponent is -1.506.

So exp(-1.506) ≈ e^(-1.5) is about 0.2231.

But let me calculate e^(-1.506):

I know that e^-1 ≈ 0.3679, e^-1.5 ≈ 0.2231, e^-1.6≈0.2019.

e^(-1.506) is somewhere between 0.22 and 0.223.

Let me use a calculator approach.

e^x for x=1.506:

Compute ln(2)=0.6931, ln(3)=1.0986.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, I can compute it.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the exact value is not needed, since the options are given. Let's see what the options are.

The options are:

A) ~1.1

B) ~7.8

C) ~4.5

D) ~2.9

Wait, but wait: the factor is R1/R2 = exp( [1/T1 - 1/T2 ] * (ΔE/k) )

Which is exp( (1/6000 -1/5500) * (ΔE/k) )

But earlier, I thought it's about 0.22, so R1/R2 ≈ 0.22.

Wait no, wait: R1 is the ratio when there's no spot (T1=6000 K), and R2 is the ratio with spots (T2=5500 K). Since the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present, R2 < R1. Therefore, R1/R2 is greater than 1.

Wait, wait a second: I thought the exponent was negative, making R1/R2 = exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.22. But that would make R1/R2 less than 1, which would imply R1 < R2, which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, let me go back. Let me recheck the expression for R1 and R2.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T is lower, the exponent is more negative, so the ratio is smaller. So R1 (no spots) is higher than R2 (with spots). So R1/R2 is greater than 1.

So, the factor should be R1/R2 = exp( [ (E2-E1)/(k T1) - (E2-E1)/(k T2) ] )

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the signs earlier.

Let me rederive it properly.

R1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k T2) ) - (ΔE/(k T1) )) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Ah, I see. Earlier, I had the exponent as (1/T1 -1/T2 ), which would make it negative. But since 1/T2 >1/T1 (as T2 < T1), so (1/T2 -1/T1) is positive.

So the exponent becomes positive, and R1/R2 is greater than 1, which aligns with the ratio decreasing when T decreases.

So, the exponent is [ (1/T2 - 1/T1) ] * (ΔE/k )

But let me compute this correctly.

So, the correct exponent is (1/T2 -1/T1) * (ΔE/k )

Which is ( (1/5500 - 1/6000) ) * (ΔE/k )

Compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.00018182

1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667

Difference: 0.00018182 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515.

Multiply by ΔE/k, which is approximately 99500 K.

So 0.00001515 * 99500 = ?

0.00001515 = 1.515e-5.

Multiply by 99500: 1.515e-5 * 9.95e4 = (1.515 *9.95) * 1e-1.

1.515 *9.95 is about 15.06.

So 15.06 *0.1 = 1.506.

So exponent is 1.506.

So R1/R2 = exp(1.506) ≈ e^1.506.

Compute e^1.506:

We know that e^1 ≈2.718, e^1.5≈4.4817, e^1.6≈4.953.

e^1.506 is between e^1.5 and e^1.6.

Let me approximate it.

Compute 1.506 -1.5 = 0.006.

e^0.006 ≈ 1.00603.

So e^1.506 ≈ e^1.5 * e^0.006 ≈4.4817 *1.00603≈4.4817 *1.006 ≈4.4817 +4.4817*0.006≈4.4817 +0.0269≈4.5086.

So approximately 4.51.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots compared to when it does not, we use the Boltzmann equation in LTE. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_2 \) and \( g_1 \) are the statistical weights of the levels, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

When the star has no spots, the effective temperature is \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature decreases to \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning \( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \) is smaller at \( T_2 \) than at \( T_1 \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_1}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{T_2}} = \exp\left(\Delta E / k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the wavelength of the transition, \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1448 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

The ratio \( \Delta E / k \) is then:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

Substituting \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \), we compute:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} \approx -0.00001515.
\]

Thus, the exponent becomes:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = 99500 \cdot (-0.00001515) \approx -1.506.
\]

The factor is then:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.506) \approx 0.221.
\]

Since the ratio decreases when the star has spots, the factor by which the ratio changes is the inverse of this value:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{1}{\exp(-1.506)} = \exp(1.506) \approx 4.5.
\]

This matches option C. 

Answer: C
