Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll walk through it step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. It gives some information about the matrix representation of Ay and the structure of the matrix S. Let me jot down the details.

So, the operator Ay is given by c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I can write S as:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And Ay is c multiplied by this matrix S. So,

Ay = (h/4π) * S.

Wait, but more accurately, since c is h/(4π), the matrix Ay is:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Hmm, I think that's correct. Now, I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question is not directly asking for their values, but which statement among the options is correct regarding the process or the outcome.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, eigenvalues are usually scalars, so they can't have both real and imaginary parts unless the operator is not Hermitian. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Wait, or are they? Wait, wait no, because the components of angular momentum are Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues must be real. So any option suggesting eigenvalues with imaginary parts is wrong. So options A and B might be incorrect because they suggest eigenvalues with both real and imaginary parts. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Wait, the operator Ay is given by (h/(4π)) times S. Let me write that matrix out. Let's compute the matrix for Ay.

h/(4π) is a constant. So,

Ay = [ (h/(4π)) * 0 , (h/(4π
