Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered. Oh wait, wait—no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with spots, and the filling factor is 20%. So that would be 20% of the hemisphere's area, right? So total spots cover 0.2 * (π R²)/2, since a hemisphere is half the sphere.

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So spots are at 5000 K.

The scenario is that when this star is observed, its brightness variations due to rotation make it look like an exoplanet transit. So the question is, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

If the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would give the same amplitude in the light curve?

I remember that the flux (brightness) from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT^4. So the star's total flux without spots would be 4π R_star² σ T_star^4.

But with spots, the observed flux would be a bit less when the spots are facing us, leading to a dip in brightness. Wait, but the question says the star is covered in dark spots, which are cooler. So when the spotted side is facing us, the star appears dimmer. The variations in brightness would be periodic as the star rotates, which is why it looks like an exoplanet transit. So for the photometric observations, the dip in brightness would be similar to an exoplanet transit.

The problem asks: to produce the same amplitude signal, what would be the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's.

So I think I need to find the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) caused by the spots and set that equal to the fractional change caused by an exoplanet transit.

Let me think about each effect.

First, the star's normal flux without any spots is F0 = σ T^4.

Wait, no, because the star's total flux is L = 4π R² σ T^4. So the surface flux per unit area is F = σ T^4. So the total flux is L = 4π R² F.

When a fraction f of the surface is covered by cooler spots at T_spot, the total flux becomes L' = (1 - f) * 4π R² F + f * 4π R² F_spot.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, right? So f = 0.2. But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere. So the total area with spots is 0.2 * (π R²/2) * 2? Hmm, wait no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the
