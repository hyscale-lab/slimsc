Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography here. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that the interplanar distance formula involves the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all the edges are of equal length, right? So in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all the angles α, β, γ are equal too. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, and the interatomic distance is 10 angstroms. So, a is 10 angstroms.

The formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) in a crystal is given by 1/(d²) = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ... Oh wait, no, that's for cubic systems. For non-cubic systems, especially rhombohedral, the formula is more complicated. I think the general formula for interplanar distance is 1/d² equals (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) plus some terms involving the angles. But since it's a rhombohedral crystal, the formula might simplify.

I recall the formula: d(hkl) = [ (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 a b (hk cos γ) + 2 a c (hl cos β) + 2 b c (kl cos α) ) ]^(-1/2). Wait, but in rhombohedral, a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So the formula should simplify.

In a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is:

d² = a² / [ (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ]

But since α=β=γ=30°, and a=b=c, the formula becomes:

d² = a² / [ h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos(30°) + 2hl cos(30°) + 2kl cos(30°) ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. No, because in
