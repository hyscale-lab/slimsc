Okay, so I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane's Miller indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - (h k +k l + l h)*(cos α)/(1 + cos α))), or something like that. Wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing some terms here. Oh wait, rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, so maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2kl cos β + 2lh cos γ))), but wait no, I think I got the signs wrong. Or was it minus the cross terms? Because in a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But in a rhombohedral system, which is a special case where a = b = c and α = β = γ, the formula changes.

Wait, I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + kl + lh) * cos α). No, wait, no, that's not right. Because for a rhombohedral structure, the angles are all the same, so the formula might involve cos α in a specific way.

Alternatively, I think I came across another formula where d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + kl + lh) cos α ), but only when α is the angle between the axes. Wait, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, let me recall the more general formula for interplanar spacing. In a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula is d_{hkl} = [ (a² (sin α)^2 + ... ) ] Wait, no, perhaps it's better to go back to the basics.

The interplanar distance d is given by the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector. The reciprocal lattice vector components are h, k,
