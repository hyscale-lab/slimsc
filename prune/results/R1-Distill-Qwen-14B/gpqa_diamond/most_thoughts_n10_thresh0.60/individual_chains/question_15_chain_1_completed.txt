Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, and they've been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. That gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. But wait, the RV method can't tell the exact mass, just a minimum, right? But the question says they know the masses, so maybe it's assumed they have the correct mass because of other info?

The planets have the same mass, which is important. But their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Using Kepler's third law, the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So if Planet_1 has a period P, Planet_2 has 3P. So Planet_2 is much farther out.

Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations since the probability of transit might be easier to compute without eccentricity effects.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. Because usually, more massive stars are bigger, but maybe Planet_1's star is younger or something else. They’re same radius but different masses, so I guess that affects the planet's position in terms of star size.

The question is about which planet is more likely to transit, as the researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability. So I need to figure out the transit probability for each.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit relative to the star's size. The formula I remember is something like (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / a), but wait, maybe not exactly. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, or something like that. Wait, no, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. The geometric probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet)/(a), but I think R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star / a.

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / (a * (1 - e²)^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), it simplifies. So the probability is proportional to (R_planet + R_star) / (a * (some factor)), but since R_planet is << R_star, it's roughly R_star / a.

Wait, no, I think the formula is (R_p / R_s) * (1 / (a / R_s)), but that might not be right. Alternatively, I've read that the probability P is approximately (R_s + R_p) / a. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / a), but that doesn't seem right because a is the semi-major axis, which could be much larger than the star's radius.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is the chance that the inclination is just right. The formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / (a), but considering the actual geometry. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is (R_p + R_s) / (a) * (1/(1 - (R_s/a)^2))^(1/2). Wait, that might be more accurate because when the semi-major axis a is much larger than R_s, the term (R_s/a) approaches zero, so the probability approaches R_p/(a), but that's only when a is much larger than R_s, which is usually the case.

Wait, no, another approach: The probability of transit is given by the ratio of the star's radius to the distance at which the planet can cause a transit. So, the probability is P = (R_s + R_p) / (a * (1 - (R_s/a)^2 )^(1/2) ) )? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / a), but that can't be right because when a is much larger than R_p, the probability would be low, but that's not correct. Because even if a is larger, the orbital plane is just a matter of alignment. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is (R_s / a) multiplied by (some factor involving the star's size).

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective is roughly (R_s / a). Because the star's angular size is R_s / a, and the planet needs to pass within that angular size for a transit to occur. So the probability would be proportional to R_s / a.

So for each planet, the probability of transit is (R_s / a). But wait, the star's radius? Both stars have the same radius, so R_s1 = R_s2. Because the question says both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is same for both.

So the probability is proportional to 1/a. So the planet with a smaller semi-major axis has a higher probability of transiting because a is smaller, so 1/a is larger.

But wait, what's the semi-major axis related to? The planet's orbital period. Using Kepler's third law, which states that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_s) / (4π²), so a^3 is proportional to M_s * P².

So a is proportional to (M_s * P²)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1:

M_s1 = 2 * M_s2 (since the host of Planet_1 is twice as massive as Planet_2's host).

P1 = (1/3) * P2 (since Planet_1 has three times shorter period).

So a1 = [ (2 M_s2) * (P1)^2 ]^(1/3) = [ 2 M_s2 * ( (P2 /3) )^2 ]^(1/3) = [ 2 M_s2 * P2² / 9 ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2 * (M_s2 / M_s2)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let's think. Let's calculate a1 and a2.

Kepler's third law is a^3 = (G * M_s * P^2)/(4π²). So a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1: a1 ∝ (M_s1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P2² / 9 )^(1/3 ).

For Planet_2: a2 ∝ (M_s2 * P2²)^(1/3) = (M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3).

So a1/a2 = [ (2 M2 P2² /9 ) / ( M2 P2² ) ]^(1/3 ) = (2/9)^(1/3) = (2)/(9^(1/3)).

Wait, 9 is 3², so 9^(1/3) is 3^(2/3). So a1 = (2 / 3^(2/3)) * a2.

Wait, but wait, M_s1 is twice M_s2. Wait, M_s1 is mass of star 1, which is twice the mass of star 2 (M_s2). So M_s1 = 2*M_s2.

So a1 is ( M_s1 * P1^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M_s2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = [2 M_s2 * P2² / 9 ]^(1/3) = [ (2/9) * M_s2 P2² ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * [ M_s2 P2² ]^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of that is about 0.6. So a1 is approximately 0.6 * a2. So a1 is smaller than a2.

Since the transit probability is proportional to R_s / a, and R_s is same for both, the probability for Planet_1 is ( R_s / a1 ) and for Planet_2 is ( R_s / a2 ).

Since a1 is smaller than a2, ( R_s / a1 ) is larger than ( R_s / a2 ), so Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

But wait, let's calculate the exact ratio. So the ratio of transit probabilities is (R_s/a1) / (R_s/a2) )= a2 / a1.

From earlier, a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) => a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) = (9)^(1/3)/(2)^(1/3) )= ( (3^2) )^(1/3) ) / (2)^(1/3) ) = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3) ).

But 3^(2/3) is approximately (3^(1/3))^2 ≈ (1.442)^2 ≈ 2.08.

2^(1/3) is around 1.26.

So 2.08 / 1.26 ≈ 1.65.

So the ratio a2/a1 is approximately 1.65. So (R_s/a1)/(R_s/a2) = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65. So Planet_1's transit probability is 1.65 times higher than Planet_2's.

Wait, but wait. Is the transit probability proportional to (R_s + R_p)/a? Or is it R_p/(a) ? Because if R_p << R_s, then R_p + R_s ≈ R_s. So the probability is roughly R_s / a.

So for Planet_1, transit probability P1 = R_s/(a1).

For Planet_2, P2 = R_s/(a2).

But a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.63.

So a1 is about 0.63 a2.

So P1 = R_s/(0.63 a2) ≈ (1/0.63) * (R_s/a2) ) ≈ 1.587 * P2.

Wait, no. Let me compute the ratio P1/P2.

P1/P2 = (R_s/a1) / (R_s/a2) )= a2/a1.

We have a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) a2.

So a2/a1 = (9/2)^(1/3) = (9)^(1/3)/(2)^(1/3) )= ( (3^2) )^(1/3) ) / (2)^(1/3) ) = 3^(2/3) / 2^(1/3) ) ≈ (2.0801) / (1.2599) ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

Now, looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says 2.7 times, which seems higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation of a1 and a2? Let me double-check.

a1 is proportional to (M_s1 * P1² )^(1/3).

M_s1 = 2 M_s2.

P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1^3 = (2 M_s2) * ( (P2/3) )² = 2 M_s2 * P2² /9.

a2^3 = M_s2 * P2².

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Hmm, wait, wait. Let's compute (2/9)^(1/3).

2=2, 9=3². So (2/9) = 2/(3^2) = 2 * 3^(-2).

So cube root is 2^(1/3) * 3^(-2/3).

So (2/9)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) / 3^(2/3) ≈ (1.26) / (2.08) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

So a2/a1 ≈ 1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So yes, the ratio is about 1.65.

So P1 = (R_s/a1) = R_s/(0.606 a2) = (1/0.606) * (R_s/a2) ) ≈ 1.65 * P2.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So the researchers prefer Planet_1, as it has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option C says 'Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.' So that's the correct answer.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The probability of a transit is proportional to \( \frac{R_s}{a} \), where \( R_s \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_s \)), the key factor is the semi-major axis (\( a \)).

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_s \cdot P^2 \), where \( M_s \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_{s1} = 2M_{s2} \)).
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)).

The semi-major axis for each planet is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left( M_s \cdot P^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_1:
\[
a_1 \propto \left( 2M_{s2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2M_{s2}P_2^2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

For Planet_2:
\[
a_2 \propto \left( M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2 \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Taking the ratio of \( a_1 \) to \( a_2 \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{\frac{2M_{s2}P_2^2}{9}}{M_{s2}P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{9^{1/3}} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{(3^2)^{1/3}} = \frac{2^{1/3}}{3^{2/3}}.
\]

Numerically:
\[
2^{1/3} \approx 1.26, \quad 3^{2/3} \approx 2.08, \quad \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx \frac{1.26}{2.08} \approx 0.606.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 has a smaller semi-major axis than Planet_2.

The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_s}{a_1}}{\frac{R_s}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}.
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \):
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{0.606a_2} \approx 1.65.
\]

Therefore, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 due to its higher transit probability.

**Option C: Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
