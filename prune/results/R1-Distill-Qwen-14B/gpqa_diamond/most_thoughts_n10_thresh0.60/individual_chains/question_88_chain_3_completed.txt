Okay, let me try to work through this question. So, the setup is about rotavirus tagged with GFP, given to mice orally. Hmm, I remember that rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis and that it has these outer proteins. Wait, the question says they tagged the inner capsid proteins, so maybe those are the ones that are more antigenic.

When they delivered them via oral gavage, which means they went into the stomach. The GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid in some cases. Stomach acid is strong, so I guess the proteins might have been broken down. But some made it through and got entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches, right? Because Peyer's patches are in the small intestine and are part of the immune system.

They observed the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests some kind of diversification process. Oh right, during an immune response, B cells undergo several processes to increase diversity.

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination. Let me think about each.

VDJ recombination is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's part of generating the initial diversity of the B cell receptor by rearranging the variable, diversity, and joining segments. But that happens early, during maturation, not after antigen exposure. So probably not D.

Complement activation is part of the innate immune response. It's about marking pathogens for destruction, maybe opsonization or causing lysis. But this doesn't directly cause variability in B cell receptors. So B is probably not the answer.

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the B cells are exposed to an antigen. This process introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, leading to higher affinity antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers during the immune response. So if they're seeing high variability in the variable heavy chains, this fits with somatic hypermutation because each cell's receptor is being tweaked for better binding.

Class switching is about changing the isotype of the antibody (like from IgM to IgG). It doesn't change the variable regions; it's more about the class. So C is about switching but not the variability in the antigen-binding site.

So putting it together: the rotavirus proteins were taken up, reached the Peyer's patches (which have a lot of B cells and APCs). The B cells that recognized them start proliferating, and during that process, undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity and specificity of their antibodies. So the high variability in the variable regions is due to somatic hypermutation.


The question involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reached the Peyer patches, where they caused proliferation in a population of cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells revealed high variability. This suggests a process that diversifies the antigen-binding regions of the B cell receptors.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
  This process occurs after antigen exposure and introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, leading to increased diversity and affinity of B cell receptors. This fits the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

- **Option B: Complement activation**  
  Complement activation is part of the innate immune response, marking pathogens for destruction. However, it does not directly cause variability in B cell receptors, making this option unlikely.

- **Option C: Class switching recombination**  
  Class switching involves changing the isotype of the antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG). While it modifies the antibody's function, it does not alter the variability of the antigen-binding site, so this is not the correct answer.

- **Option D: VDJ recombination**  
  VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity by rearranging variable, diversity, and joining gene segments. This process happens before antigen exposure and is not relevant to the observed variability in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in the germinal centers during the immune response to an antigen. This process diversifies the B cell receptors to enhance antigen recognition and binding.
