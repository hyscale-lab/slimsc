Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me try to think this through.

The question says: A charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, each with different expressions.

Wait, so the setup is a conducting sphere. Since it's a conductor, any excess charge would reside on the surface. But wait, the sphere is grounded. Oh right, when a conductor is grounded, it can let charges flow in or out. So if another charge is placed near it, electrons might move to the sphere's surface to cancel the field inside.

But here, the sphere is initially neutral because it's grounded, I think. Because if it's grounded and isolated, it would stay at the ground potential. So when a charge q is placed nearby, the sphere would induce charges on its surface to maintain electrostatic equilibrium.

Wait, but the charge q is placed outside the sphere. So the sphere being a conductor, the charges will redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, any induced charges will adjust accordingly. Oh, right, when a charge is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges will be such that the interior remains at zero potential. But wait, the sphere is grounded, so the potential on its surface is zero, same as the ground.

Wait, no. The conductor's surface must be an equipotential at the same potential as the surrounding. If it's grounded, the potential is set to zero. So the conducting sphere is at zero potential.

But the charge q is placed outside. So the conductor's surface will have induced charges. Let me think: the charge q will cause the sphere to have an induced charge of -q on its outer surface, but wait, no, that's when the sphere is isolated. Wait, if the sphere is grounded, the induced charge might not just be the opposite of q. Because the ground can supply or remove charges.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a charge q is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced charge of -q (if it was isolated), but since it's grounded, the charges can flow. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

If the sphere is conducting and uncharged, and we bring a charge q near it, the charge q will cause the electrons in the sphere to redistribute. Since the
