Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as c times the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, so A_y = c * S. Let me write down what S looks like. S is:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So then, A_y is c times that matrix. Oh, right, c is h/(4π), so A_y = (h/(4π)) * S.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. But the question is about which statement is correct regarding the calculation process. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, let me recall that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and a is the eigenvalue.

Let me compute A_y first. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So each element of S is multiplied by c. So A_y is:

[ 0 * c    (-i) * c ]
[ i * c     0 * c ]

Which is:

[ 0        -i c ]
[ i c       0 ]

So the matrix A_y is [[0, -i c], [i c, 0]]. 

To find the eigenvalues, I'll set up the characteristic equation:

det( A_y - a I ) = 0

Which becomes:

| -a      (-i c) |
| (i c)   (-a)  | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, let's compute that. The product (-i c)(i c) is (-i)(i) * c². Since (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = +1. So that part is (1) c².

So the determinant is a² - ( c² ) = 0.

So the equation is a² = c². So the eigenvalues a are plus and minus c.

But wait, c is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but hold on. The options don't directly show this. Let me look.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues for angular momentum are real, so they shouldn't have imaginary parts. So A must be wrong.

Option B suggests imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That doesn't match either because our eigenvalues are real, so their imaginary parts should be zero. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Well, I know that for angular momentum, [A², Az] = 0, so the eigenfunctions of A² and Az are simultaneous eigenfunctions. But wait, A_y and A_z don't commute, so their eigenfunctions are different. So if a function is an eigenfunction of A_y, it can be an eigenfunction of A², but not of A_z.

Wait, but can it be an eigenfunction of both A_y and A²? I think A² commutes with any component, so if φ is an eigenfunction of A_y, then it is also an eigenfunction of A² because A² and A_y commute. Because [A², A_y] = 0. Since A² is the sum of squares of the components (A_x, A_y, A_z), but the commutators between A²
