Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does not show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a bonding electron from one atom to another, leading to an isomer with a different structure but same molecular formula. Like in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move, such as in some carbonyl compounds.

Benzoquinoneâ€”I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound, maybe with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is C6H4O2, right? It's a cyclic di-ketone, so it has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. So, like 1,4-benzoquinone or 1,2-benzoquinone? Well, regardless, it's a cyclic structure with two ketones.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups. So it's a six-membered ring with ketones at positions 1,3,5. So that's three ketones on a cyclohexane ring.

Tautomerism typically occurs when there are adjacent double bonds or when there's a possibility of keto-enol tautomerism. But wait, for keto-enol to happen, the compound needs a carbonyl group adjacent to another carbon with hydrogen. So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is adjacent to other carbonyls? Let's see: the ring has three alternating ketones. So each group is on carbons 1,3,5. So each is separated by two CH2 groups. So maybe each ketone is not adjacent to another carbonyl group, so maybe no enol tautomer is possible. Alternatively, maybe the positions allow for some conjugation that could cause tautomerism.

Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone,
