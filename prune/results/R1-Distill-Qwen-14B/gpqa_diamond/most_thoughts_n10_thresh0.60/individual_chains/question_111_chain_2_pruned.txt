Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the major products for two reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I need to determine which major products A and B are formed, and then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction A: 

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. That's a cyclohexanone derivative. I'm thinking maybe it's a Claisen or some kind of aldol condensation reaction, but wait, ethyl acrylate is an acrylate ester, which is a Michael acceptor. Oh wait, no, Michael addition is when a nucleophile attacks the alpha position of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, since the starting material is a ketone, perhaps it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) if the starting ketone can undergo some enolate formation.

Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives can undergo enolate formation under basic conditions. t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's probably deprotonating the ketone to form an enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the acrylate. But wait, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So, the acrylate has the structure where the carbonyl is at the end, conjugated with a double bond.

In a typical Michael addition, the enolate (nucleophile) attacks the alpha position (the beta to the carbonyl) of the Michael acceptor. So in this case, ethyl acrylate would be the acceptor. The enolate from the cyclohexanone would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

Wait, but where would the enolate form on the cyclohexanone? The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, with substituents at 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). The structure is probably such
