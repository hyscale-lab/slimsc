Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. Let me think through each of the given compounds.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each combining some of these compounds.

Let me go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, this is a biphenyl compound with substituents. Let me visualize the structure. The biphenyl has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which comes from chirality. So, does this compound have any chiral centers?

Wait, the substituents are dimethyl esters and nitro groups. So each of the two phenyl rings has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester group at position 2. But on biphenyl, the single bond between the two rings allows for free rotation, I think. Oh, wait, but in some cases, like if the substituents are in a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image, maybe the biphenyl itself can have a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have at least one chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry so that it's not chiral.

Wait, in this case, the biphenyl has two ester groups at 2,2' and two nitro groups at 6,6'. So the substituents are in positions that are symmetric across the central axis. Let me think: the molecule is symmetrical because each ring has the same substituents. So when you rotate the biphenyl, the mirror image might be the same as the original. Therefore, maybe this compound doesn't have optical isomerism. Because if it's symmetrical, it can't be chiral.

Hmm, or does the substituent arrangement cause the molecule to be non-symmetrical? Let me think again. The substituents are on positions 2
