Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, okay, let's read it carefully.

The setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. We need to find the difference between the correct T1 (using relativistic considerations) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Okay, so first, I need to figure out the masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2, where m1 is the more massive one. The problem says m1 is twice as massive as the other, so m1 = 2*m2. Also, m1 + m2 = 0.99*M, since the sum is 99% of M.

Substituting m1 = 2*m2 into the sum equation: 2m2 + m2 = 0.99M → 3m2 = 0.99M → m2 = 0.33M. So m1 is 0.66M, right?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. 0.33M * 3 is 0.99M, yes. So m1 is 0.66M and m2 is 0.33M.

Now, the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Let me denote their velocities as v1 and v2, but wait, actually, since in relativity momentum is gamma*m*v, but in the non-relativistic case, it's m*v. Hmm, but for initial calculations, I think I should compute the velocities and then find kinetic energies.

Wait, but the problem is about the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical approximation. So perhaps I should compute both and subtract.

Let me think about the process. Since the system is isolated and initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momentum of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, m1 * v1 = m2 * v2, but wait, if we're using non-relativistic momentum, then yes. But in reality, in relativity, it's gamma*m*v. So this will affect the velocities.

Wait, but perhaps I should first find the velocities using both approaches.

So, let's approach this step by step.

First, let's compute the momentum conservation in the relativistic case.

But wait, perhaps I should find the velocities first, then compute the kinetic energies.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the energy released and then distribute it between the two fragments.

Wait, another approach: The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. After fission, the rest mass energy of the two fragments is 0.99 * M * c² (since M is the initial mass). So the energy released is 300 GeV - 0.99*M*c². Wait, but wait, the rest mass of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV, and the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 0.99 M. But M is the rest mass of the initial nucleus. So the rest mass of the fragments is 0.99 M, meaning that the initial rest energy is 300 GeV, so the rest mass of the fragments is 0.99 * (300 GeV)? No, wait, no, because M is the initial rest mass. So the rest mass of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So the energy released is (300 GeV - 0.99 M c²). But wait, if M is in units where c² is 1 (as in, when using GeV for energy and GeV/c² for mass), then the rest energy is
