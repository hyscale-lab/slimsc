Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are given in meters, ranging from 1e-9 m to 1e-1 m.

Wait, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be affected by their speed relative to the observer. Because in relativity, moving clocks run slower, but wait no, that's the other way around. If the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime. Oh right, time dilation. The formula is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how does that relate to the resolution? Oh, I think the resolution here refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point from the production point in the bubble chamber. So, if the particle moves a certain distance before decaying, that distance must be less than the resolution to be observed correctly. So the requirement is that the average decay length (distance traveled before decay) is at least 30% detected. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "at least 30% of the decays." So we need to make sure that the resolution is sufficient to see the decay in at least 30% of the cases. So I think the idea is to calculate the length that the particle travels on average and set that to the resolution.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So in the lab frame, since the particle is moving, its lifetime is longer. The distance it travels before decaying is velocity multiplied by the lifetime in the lab frame, right?

So the average decay length L is v * τ = v * γ τ₀. But wait, gamma is v/(c² sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), but maybe it's easier to compute gamma from the energy and mass.

The energy of the particle is given as 27 GeV. The mass is
