Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum, and the options are A to D. 

Wait, in quantum mechanics, when the potential is separable in polar coordinates, the problem can be solved by solving the radial and angular parts separately. Right, because the Hamiltonian often separates into radial and angular components when the potential depends on r and θ in a certain way.

Looking at the potential V(r,θ): it's (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor that. So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Or maybe I can think of it as two terms: V(r) = (1/2)kr² and V(θ) = (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Wait, but actually, both terms have kr² multiplied by some function of θ. So maybe it's better to see if the potential can be written in terms of r and angular terms that separate. 

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The first term is (1/2)kr², which is purely radial. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ, which is proportional to cos²θ. So the entire potential is a sum of a radial term and an angular term multiplied by r². 

In polar coordinates, the potential's angular dependence is cos²θ. I remember that in such cases, especially for central potentials, the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the radial and angular parts. But wait, in this case, the potential has angular dependence, so the problem might not be purely radial. Hmm, so maybe it's a kind of perturbation? Or perhaps the angular part can be treated separately.

Wait, no. Let me think about the form of the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates. The Hamiltonian is H = (-ħ²/(2m)) (1/r)(d/dr)(r dr) + (-ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²/dθ²) ) + V(r,θ). So here, V(r,θ) is (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So the potential is V(r,θ)
