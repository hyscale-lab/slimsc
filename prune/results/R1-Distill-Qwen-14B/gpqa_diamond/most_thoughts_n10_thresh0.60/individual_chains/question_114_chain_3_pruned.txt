Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to find the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with a nitrile, what usually happens? Oh right, I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism is something like the cyanide attacking the carbonyl carbon.

But wait, what's the product here? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, wait, wait. No, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN adds to it, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Oh, because the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, making the cyanide group attach and then the proton comes in from where? Oh, wait, the mechanism is that the ketone is attacked by CN‚Åª, which adds to the carbonyl carbon making an intermediate that's then protonated. Then maybe it's a substitution? Or maybe it's a two-step process where the nitrile is added and then a proton is added elsewhere.

Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write that structure. That would be (CH3)C(OH)(CH2CN)CH3? Wait no, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is (CH2CN)(CH3)C(OH)CH3? Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butane has four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but 2-hydro
