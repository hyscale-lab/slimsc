Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents from the options provided.

First, let's look at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that in the presence of a base, ketones can undergo a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. But ketones typically don't react with such nucleophiles unless in specific conditions. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the mechanism here.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's an example of a cyanohydrin formation. Oh right! The cyanohydrin reaction. That's when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and then the base deprotonates to form the alcohol. So the product would be a secondary alcohol with a cyano group attached.

So for the cyanohydrin formation, the reagent A should be an acid. Because the reaction usually uses an acid catalyst like H3O+ or H2SO4. Looking at the options,
