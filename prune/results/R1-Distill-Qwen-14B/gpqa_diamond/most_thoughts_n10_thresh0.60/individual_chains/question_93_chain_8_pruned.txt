Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about qPCR and calibration curves.

The scientist is making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples in technical replicates, and the qPCR efficiency was 100%, which I think means it's perfect, so the efficiency equation would be something like 100% efficient, meaning each cycle doubles the target.

The RÂ² value is 1, which indicates a perfect correlation between the dilutions and the Ct values. That makes sense; a perfect curve. The slope is -3.3, which I remember relates to the efficiency. The formula for the slope (b) in the qPCR equation is b = ln(10)/E. Wait, E is the efficiency. If E is 100%, that's 1, so ln(10) is about 2.3026. So 2.3026 divided by 1 is 2.3026. But his slope is -3.3, which is more negative than that. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula for the slope when using the standard curve method is slope = ln(10)/E, but with a negative sign because as the starting quantity increases, Ct decreases. So if the efficiency is 100% (E=1), the slope should be -3.3219 approximately? Because ln(10) is about 2.3026, but wait, 100% efficiency is E=1, so 2.3026/1 is 2.3026, so slope is -2.3026. But the given slope here is -3.3, which is more negative. So wait, that doesn't match. Because with 100% efficiency, the slope should be around -3.3219? Wait, maybe I'm confused. Wait, let me think again. Let me calculate ln(10)/E. If E is 100% (E=1), then ln(10) is about 2.3026, so the slope is -2.3026. But the given slope is -3.3, which is bigger in magnitude. So that suggests that perhaps the efficiency isn't 100%... But the question says efficiency was 100%, so this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Oh, wait, another formula: the slope is calculated based on the equation. The formula is:

Ct = Ct0 + (log10(E^-1)) * log10(N0)

But wait, more accurately, the standard curve method uses the equation:

Ct = - (log10(E)) * log10(N0) + Ct0

Which can be rewritten as:

Ct = (log10(1/E)) * log10(N0) + Ct0

So the slope (b) is log10(1/E) because when you express it in terms of log10(N0), the equation
