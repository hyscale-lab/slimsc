Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So I need to figure out which of these options has the highest density.

Let me read the options again. The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a to d, each describing different properties.

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth, so Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³. That's a known value, I think. Earth is pretty dense because it's made of rock and metal.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. No, wait. Let me read again. Oh, option b says it's a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of about 5.5. Wait, that can't be right. Because if density is given, maybe the density is 5.5, but wait, the question is about which has the highest density. But wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The question is which planet has the highest density. So option b says the planet has a density of 5.5. So if another planet has a higher density, then option b isn't the answer.

Option c: same composition as Earth, but 5 times Earth's mass. So if it's the same composition, what does that mean for density? Well, same composition implies same density because density is mass/volume. But wait, if the mass increases, but the radius also increases because volume
