Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product formed after a reaction. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That sounds a bit complex, but let's parse it. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with a double bond. The "3-en" part tells me the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Then, the substituents are a formyl group on carbon 2 and a vinyl group (which is CH2=CH-) on carbon 5.

Wait, no, wait. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so when it's attached as a substituent on the ring, it's at position 5. So the structure would have a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5.

The reaction conditions are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, that's the Clemmensen reduction, right? Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. Wait, but wait, what's the starting material here? The starting molecule has a formyl group (which is a carbonyl group, RCHO) and a vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Clemmensen reduction typically reduces ketones (RCOR') to alkanes (RCH2R'). But wait, the starting material here is a cyclohexenecarboxylic acid with a formyl group. So, the formyl is a carbonyl, so maybe that's the part that's getting reduced.

But wait, the carboxylic acid group is COOH. How does the Clemmensen reaction affect that? Oh wait, wait. Clemmensen is usually done in an acidic environment with HI. Oh, but wait, carboxylic acids are acidic. So, would the COOH group be deprotonated? Or is the HI acting as a source of H-?

Wait, the Clemmensen reduction uses red phosphorus and HI. It's a strong reducing agent, usually for aldehydes and ketones. Wait, but carboxylic acids are not typically reduced by Clemmensen, unless under specific conditions. Or wait, maybe the COOH group isn't involved in the reaction. Let me think.

So the starting molecule has a formyl (CHO) group. That's a carb
