Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to think through this.

First, I need to remember what parallax is. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from different points in Earth's orbit around the Sun. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer to us.

The question states that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means that their spatial density is the same throughout space. So, if I consider a spherical shell at a certain distance from Earth, the number of stars in that shell depends on the volume of the shell and the density of stars.

Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula relating parallax to distance is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs, I think). So, distance d = 1/plx.

If I have a shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere (4πd²) multiplied by dr. So V = 4πd² dr.

But since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, V = 4π (1/plx)^2 dr.

Now, the number of stars in a volume would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars (n). Number density is the number of stars per unit volume, and since the distribution is uniform, n is constant.

So number of stars N = n * V = n *4π (1/plx)^2 dr.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how the count changes with plx. Wait, the dr term is in terms of distance, but how does that relate to plx?

Parallax plx is 1/d, so if the distance changes by dr, the change in plx dplx would be the derivative of plx with respect to d multiplied by dr. Let's compute that: plx = 1/d → dplx = - (1/d²) dr. So dr = -d² dplx. But since plx is positive, I'll take the absolute value, so dr = (1/(plx²)) dplx.

Substituting back into N, we get N = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, let me make sure. dr is (1/plx²) dplx, right? So substituting that:

N = n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx?

Wait, no. Wait, the shell's volume is 4πd² dr. d is 1/plx, so d squared is 1/(plx²). So dr is in terms of d. So 4πd² dr = 4π (1/plx²) dr. But dr is (1/(plx²)) dplx. So substituting:

4π (1/plx²) * (1/(plx²)) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) would be N divided by dplx. So that would be n *4π (1/plx^4).

Wait, no, wait. The question is about the number per unit range of plx. So for a given plx, how does the number of stars in a small range (dplx) depend on plx.

So N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * dr. And dr is (1/(plx^2)) dplx. So substituting:

N = n *4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx = n *4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So N = (4π n) / plx^4 * dplx.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) is
