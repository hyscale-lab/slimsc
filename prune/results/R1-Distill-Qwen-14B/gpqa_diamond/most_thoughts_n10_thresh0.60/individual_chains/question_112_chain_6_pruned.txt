Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because right now it's only proportional, not necessarily a unit vector.

Wait, the question says "calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator..." So the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So this matrix is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin states (up and down are the eigenstates of S_z). 

Let me think about what this operator looks like. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero because when i=j, A_ij is zero. The off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would be:

[ 0,   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Hmm, this looks a lot like the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yeah, scaling that gives us this operator.

Now, the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of X are the spin states in the x-direction, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. Specifically, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), or something like that.

Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check: The eigenstates of the Pauli X (σ_x) operator are indeed (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So the operator given here is (ħ/2)σ_x, so its eigenstates are the same as σ_x but with eigenvalues ±(ħ/2).

So the question is asking for the probabilities of measuring the system in each of these eigenstates (|+x> and |−x>). So essentially, we need to express the state |alpha> in terms of the |+x> and |−x> basis and find the probabilities.

But wait, first, let's handle the initial state |alpha>. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So we need to normalize this state. The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

The coefficients are (1+i) and (2−i). Let me compute their magnitudes squared. For the first coefficient: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. For the second: (2−i)(2+i) = 4 +1 =5. So the squared magnitudes are 2 and 5. Adding them together gives 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), so |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2−i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, to find the probabilities of measuring in each eigenstate of the operator, which are |+x> and |−x>. Alternatively, we can express |alpha> in the |+x> and |−x> basis and square the coefficients to get the probabilities.

Alternatively, since the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, the probabilities are the square of the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

Let me write down |+x> and |−x> again:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So the inner product < +x | alpha > would be [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2
