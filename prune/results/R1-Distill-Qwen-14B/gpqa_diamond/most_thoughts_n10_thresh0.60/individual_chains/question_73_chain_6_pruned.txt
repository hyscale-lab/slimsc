Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: Two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so the options are A to D. First, I need to find the relative speed between them. Oh right, in relativity, you don't just subtract speeds like you would in classical mechanics. There's that velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So u is the speed of one object relative to the other's frame. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's speed?

Wait no, actually, I think I have to consider the frame of one of them. Let's pick the frame of the astronaut moving at 0.6c (A) and find the speed of the other astronaut (B) relative to A. Because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no
