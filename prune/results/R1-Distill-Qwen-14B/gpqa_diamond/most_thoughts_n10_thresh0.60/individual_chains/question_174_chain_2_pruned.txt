Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We're told that the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. The question is asking for the difference between the correct T1 value and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are in MeV, ranging from 2 to 20.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to understand the setup. The nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

Let me break it down. The initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, which is a lot. But the sum of the rest masses after fission is 99% of M. Wait, so the sum is 0.99*M, and the initial was M. So the mass defect is 1% of M. That means some energy is released as binding energy, which becomes kinetic energy of the fragments.

Since the nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. The problem states that one is twice as massive as the other. Let's say m1 is the more massive one, so m1 = 2*m2.

Wait, but the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99*M. Since m1 = 2*m2, substituting gives 2*m2 + m2 = 3*m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99M /3 = 0.33 M. Therefore, m1 = 2/3 M and m2 = 1/3 M.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that math. 2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99M /3 = 0.33 M? No, 0.99/3 is 0.33, but 0.33 times 3 is 0.99. Yeah, right. So m1 is 2/3 M, m2 is 1/3 M.

Now, the rest-mass energy of the original nucleus was 300 GeV, but the rest masses of the fragments sum to 0.99 M. So the mass defect is M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. That mass defect is converted into kinetic energy, right? Because in nuclear reactions, the energy comes from the rest mass difference.

But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M is the rest mass, which is 300 GeV/cÂ². But when the nucleus splits, the rest masses of the fragments are 0.99 M, so their combined rest-energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV. That 3 GeV is the total kinetic energy plus any binding energy (like in the form of gamma rays or other particles, but the problem states that nothing else is produced, so all that energy goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore the electrons. So perhaps we don't have to consider any electrons in the fragments, just the nucleus. So all the energy from the mass defect goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

So the total kinetic energy (K_total) is 3 GeV. But let's calculate it in more precise terms.

According to
