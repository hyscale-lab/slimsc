Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A (C3H6), which I think is propene because that's C3H6. Let's see what each step does.

First reaction: Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH₂=CH₂CH3) would add bromine to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propene is CH₂=CHCH₂? No, wait, propene is CH₂=CH₂CH3? No wait, propene is actually CH₂=CHCH3, right? So when it undergoes bromination, it would add Br2 across the double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dibromopropane (CH₂Br-CHBr-CH3). So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. But wait, B is 1,2-dibromopropane, right? So when two vicinal bromides (bromines on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they might eliminate two equivalents of HBr. So two E2 reactions could happen. Let me think: each Br is on adjacent carbons. So removing H from one adjacent carbon to each Br, leading to the formation of a double bond. So for 1,2-dibromopropane, removing two HBr would give back propene. Wait, but wait, the starting compound is propene, so after bromination and then elimination, we get back propene? Hmm. Or maybe it's possible to form another alkene?

Wait, but when you have vicinal dihalides like 1,2-dibromopropane, treating with alcoholic KOH would dehydrohalogenate twice, removing two HBr molecules. So that would form an alkene. The possible products would depend on where the elimination occurs. Let's see:

The structure of B is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When KOH (alcoholic) is added, each Br is adjacent. So each Br can attack a beta hydrogen. So let's imagine eliminating H from the first carbon (CH
