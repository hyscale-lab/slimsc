Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these multiple-choice questions can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Let me read it again and note the key points.

So, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is just about 3 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C). Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry, probably something common.

Hmm. First, I think I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let's think about reagents in organic chemistry that react violently with something to release a gas. Common reagents could be something like a strong base or a metal, perhaps.

Wait, reactions that produce gases upon mixing with another liquid. For example, metals reacting with acids to produce hydrogen gas. But I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. Let's see, H2O has 8 protons (since O is 8) but that's a molecule. Wait, but the gas is a molecule, not an atom. So for each molecule, the sum of protons and neutrons in each atom?

Wait no, wait. The molecule's entire molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, if W is H2O, each molecule has (protons: H2 is 2, O is 8; total protons 10. Neutrons: H has 0 or 1, but assuming normal H, 0. O is 8, so O has 8 neutrons. So total neutrons in H2O would be 8. Protons are 10
