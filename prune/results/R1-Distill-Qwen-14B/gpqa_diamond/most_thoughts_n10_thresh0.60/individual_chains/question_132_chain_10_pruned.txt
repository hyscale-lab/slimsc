Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their NMR spectra. Both compounds have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, wait. Let me break this down. So the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two compounds. The aromatic region has two singlets integrating for a ratio of 1:1. That probably means each compound contributes one singlet. Because if each has a singlet, and they're in 1:1, the total would be two signals each integrating as a singlet.

And in the aliphatic region, around 2.2 ppm, there are three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio. So the aliphatic signals must come from different types of protons in the two compounds. Let's think about what those could be.

Looking at the options, all the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene would have ethyl groups attached to the benzene. Each ethyl group has two types of protons: the CH2 adjacent to the benzene (maybe around 1.3 ppm) and the CH3 at the end (maybe around 1.0 ppm), but that's just a rough thought. Or wait, maybe my shifts are off. I think the CH2 next to the benzene might be deshielded a bit, so higher ppm. Hmm.

But wait, the aliphatic signals are at 2.2 ppm. Let's think about what gives peaks around there. Maybe something like CH3 groups attached to something else, like maybe adjacent to an oxygen or attached to the ring in a way that deshields them. Alternatively, perhaps geminal protons or something else.

Wait, the compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which has diethyl groups. Let me list each option's structure.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. So each has four
