Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me try to think through this. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. They used both the transit and radial velocity methods to detect them. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. 

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits and same albedo. We need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures, Planet1 to Planet2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. The formula I remember is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ... Oh, but wait, the albedos are the same, so that part cancels out. So the ratio would be based on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planets' orbital distances.

But wait, how do I find the orbital distances? Because the question gives us the Doppler shifts. Oh, right! The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. But without knowing the period, maybe we can relate the shifts to the mass and the velocity amplitude, which relates to the planet's distance.

Wait, no. Let me think. The radial velocity (RV) method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us due to the planet's gravitational pull. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by a formula that involves the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. But without the period, I'm not sure how to get the distance. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of the velocities, which would relate to the ratio of the Doppler shifts.

Wait, the question gives the shifts as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2 respectively. Let me think about the Doppler shift formula. The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is equal to v/c, where v is the velocity. But since the shifts are given in absolute terms, perhaps I can find the velocities of the star due to each planet.

Wait, but the forbidden line is
