Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through this. So, the question is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth in a super fast spacecraft. The speed is given as 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really close to the speed of light, right? So, I remember that when you travel at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation effects come into play. Time dilation is part of Einstein's theory of relativity, right?

The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. Wait, the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut," so this is the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler. So, I think I should calculate the proper time, tau (τ), using the time dilation formula.

But wait, I also need to know the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The distance is approximately 160,000 light-years away. Wait, no, wait. I think I might be mixing it up. Wait, no, actually, the distance is about 160,000 light-years. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. Oh, wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. So that's the distance we're dealing with here.

So the distance is about 160,000 light-years. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. Let me compute the time it would take from Earth's frame of reference first, and then account for time dilation.

From Earth's perspective, the time taken (t) is distance divided by speed. So t = d / v. Here, d is 160,000 light-years, and v is 0.99999987c. So, t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 / ~1 (but just slightly less than 1). Let me compute that. 160,000 divided by 0.99999987 is approximately 160,000 * 1.00000013. Wait, because dividing by a number slightly less than 1 is like multiplying by a bit more than 1. Let me approximate. 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013, so 1/(1-x) ≈ 1 + x when x is small (like x is 0.00000013). So 160,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3e-7. Let me compute 160,000 * 1.3e-7. 1.3e-
