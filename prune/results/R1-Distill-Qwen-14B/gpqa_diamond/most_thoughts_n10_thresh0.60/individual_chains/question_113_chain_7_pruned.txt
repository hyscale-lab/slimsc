Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what I remember. The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas. Hmm.

First, the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I think that's usually an O-H stretch. Broad peaks around there are typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. But sometimes esters can have O-H if they're like hemiacetals or something, but I'm not sure.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Oh, 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's common in ketones, aldehydes, esters, carboxylic acids, or amides. The 1650 cm-1 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring or conjugated system. Wait, for example, conjugated carbonyls or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group in a ketone and another in something else? Or maybe it's an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Wait, but aromatics usually show absorption around 1600 cm-1. So 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene group. Oh, and the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that the molecule has some sort of unsaturated structure, like an alkene.

Then, the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. I need to think about what that could be. Common fragment ions at m/z 45... Well, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2-? Wait, no. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 15 (CH3) *2 +16 (O) = 46? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is
