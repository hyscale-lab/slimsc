Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again.

Astronomers are studying three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They used the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, their mass ratios, and their albedos, which are all 0.3. I need to find the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm. So the question is about the orbital periods. The problem gives me temperature ratios and mass ratios. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = (L * (1 - a) )^(1/4) / (16 * π * σ * D^2)^(1/4), but maybe I can simplify that.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4). But perhaps a better approach is to think about the relationship between the equilibrium temperatures. Because all the planets have the same star, L is the same for all. Also, the albedo a is given as 0.3 for all. So for each planet, T is proportional to (1/(D^2))^(1/4) which is (1/D^(1/2)). So T ∝ 1/√D. 

So if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, T2 of Planet2, and T3 of Planet3, then T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2 / D1). Because if T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). Similarly, T2/T3 = sqrt(D3 / D2).

Wait, let me check that. If T ∝ 1/√D, then T1 = k/(√D1), T2 = k/(√D2). So T1 / T2 = (√D2)/(√D1) ) = sqrt(D2/D1). So yes.

The problem gives T1/T2 ≈ 1.4. So sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 is about 1.96 times D1.

Similarly, T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. So sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3 → D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29. So D3 is about 5.29 times D2.

Wait, but if I multiply these ratios, I can find D3/D1. Because D3 = D2 * 5.29, and D2 = D1 * 1.96. So D3 = D1 * 1.96 * 5.29.

Let me calculate that. 1.96 * 5.29. Let's see, 2*5.29 is about 10.58, but since it's 1.96, which is 0.04 less than 2, so 10.58 - (0.04 *5.29) = 10.58 - 0.2116 ≈ 10.3684. So D3 is approximately 10.3684 times D1.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods. Kepler's third law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star). So P² ∝ D³, but only if the mass of the planet is negligible compared to the star. Wait, but the problem gives me the mass ratios. Hmm.

Wait, the mass of the
