Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the fission of an atomic nucleus. Hmm, fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, right? And in this case, it's splitting into two fragments. The question is about the kinetic energy difference between the more massive fragment in the correct relativistic calculation and the classical approximation.

Let me read the problem again. The initial nucleus has a rest mass M with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It splits into two fragments where one is twice as massive as the other. So the masses are in a 2:1 ratio. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Wait, so M is the initial rest mass, and the two fragments have a combined rest mass of 0.99M?

Wait no, wait. Let me think. If the initial nucleus is at rest, and it splits into two fragments, but in reality, when a nucleus fissions, it usually emits some neutrons or other particles, but the problem says it splits into two fragments and nothing else. So the total mass of the two fragments is less than the original. Because some energy is released as kinetic energy, which is the binding energy.

Wait, the problem says the sum of rest-masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. So, M_initial = M, M_final_rest = 0.99 M. So the rest mass has decreased by 1%, so the rest mass energy is 300 GeV, so that's the initial energy. After fission
