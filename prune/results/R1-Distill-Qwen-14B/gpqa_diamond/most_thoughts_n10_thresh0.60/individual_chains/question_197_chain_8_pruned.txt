Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different organic compound.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches, usually around 2500-3000 and a strong peak around 2500 for the acidic O-H. Alternatively, this could also be an alcohol or maybe even an amine, but amine N-H is usually a bit lower. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions are around the area for aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's break it down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): This is a very deshielded proton. For a benzene ring, a proton at 10.5 could be an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it might be an O-H proton, but carboxylic acids have O-H around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But wait, in the NMR, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an -OH group, like in a phenol? No, phenols are usually less downfield, maybe around 5 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid's -COOH proton. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm, which fits here. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

But wait, looking at the other peaks:

- 8.
