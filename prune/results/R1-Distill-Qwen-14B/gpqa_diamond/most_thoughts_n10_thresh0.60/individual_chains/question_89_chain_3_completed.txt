Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH to give product 1, which is a light yellow solid. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I'll go through each reaction step by step and see what each product might be.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) at 240°C. I remember that when dihalides react with strong bases like KOH, elimination reactions can happen, leading to alkenes. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a dihalide, KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination. Since it's heated and there's excess KOH, probably a double elimination occurs. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So 1 and 3 positions on the adamantane skeleton. The structure of adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings, so the positions 1 and 3 are on adjacent carbons perhaps?

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide? No, because in adamantane, the positions are more spread out. Oh, wait, let me think. Adamantane has a structure where each carbon is part of three rings. So, 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent carbons, but the dihalide isn't vicinal. Wait, maybe it's on carbons that are two apart? Or perhaps it's a meso compound.

Hmm, but regardless, when KOH is added, elimination occurs. Since KOH is a strong base, it's likely to form an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But since both bromines are in the structure, maybe two eliminations happen, but wait, 1,3-dibromide would have two Br atoms on the same or different positions.

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that each Br is on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure. So heating with KOH would cause two E2 eliminations, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. So product 1 would be an adamantylene, perhaps 1,3-adamantylene. Because each elimination would form a double bond between adjacent carbons.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on positions 1 and 3. So if each Br is on a different carbon, perhaps each elimination forms a double bond. Wait, but if they are on adjacent carbons, then each elimination would form a double bond. Wait, maybe the two Br are on the same carbon? No, 1,3 suggests different carbons.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a compound with two Br atoms on positions 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. Since each carbon in adamantane is connected to three others, the positions 1 and 3 might not be adjacent but perhaps in some other arrangement. But for elimination, the position of the Br atoms matter. If the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. But if they're on non-adjacent carbons, perhaps the elimination would form a different structure.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a different carbon, and the KOH would abstract a β-hydrogen from each carbon, leading to the formation of a double bond. So product 1 would be 1,3-didehydrogenated adamantane, but wait, that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a different carbon, and each elimination forms a double bond, so the product is an alkene. But given that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is symmetrical, maybe the product is a single alkene, perhaps 1,3-adamantylene, which would be a diene? No, wait, elimination of two HBr would form a diene? Or maybe a monoene.

Wait, but KOH is in excess, so maybe two elimination steps occur. Let me think about the reaction conditions. Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely leads to a double elimination, forming an alkene. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a different face, but the elimination leads to a conjugated diene. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. The IR peak suggests a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. Wait, that's conflicting with the initial thought that product 1 is an alkene. So maybe I was wrong.

Wait, IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl peak, which is more characteristic of an ester or ketone. So product 1 might not be an alkene but a ketone or ester.

Wait a minute, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. But with two Br atoms, substitution would lead to a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretches (like broad peaks around 3300), so perhaps it's an esterification or some kind of substitution leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation followed by a rearrangement. Or maybe the base causes a substitution that forms a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination leading to a ketone or ester. Wait, maybe the starting material is a dihalide, and KOH causes a Dieckmann-type elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bromoalkane, but in this case, it's a dihalide.

Wait, maybe the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when KOH is added, it leads to the formation of a ketone. Because the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which might be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a number of equivalent CH2 groups, and 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another CH2 group.

Wait, so if product 1 has a carbonyl group, perhaps it's an epoxide. But wait, epoxides usually have two protons adjacent to the oxygen, but their chemical shifts are around 3-4 ppm. Oh, but in this case, 4.79 ppm may be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an ether or ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe the product is a diketone. But then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, which fits. So if the product is a ketone, the NMR would not have a peak at 4.79 ppm, unless it's some other group.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl peak. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a glycol, but that would have O-H stretches, which the IR doesn't show. So that's probably not it.

Another angle: The IR peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an ester or a ketone.

Wait, considering the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But two substitutions might form a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H. Alternatively, maybe elimination forms a carbonyl, like a ketone.

Wait, elimination reactions can sometimes form carbonyl groups. For example, in the formation of ketones via elimination from a geminal dihalide. Oh, wait! If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a vicinal dihalide, perhaps each elimination would form a double bond, but if they're on adjacent carbons, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide which upon elimination forms an alkene. Wait, but the IR doesn't have a peak for an alkene (like around 1650 cm-1 for C=C). Instead, it's 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps there's another reaction pathway. Oh! Maybe it's a double elimination leading to a ketone. Wait, but how?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a quaternary carbon. So when KOH is added, each Br is eliminated as HBr, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond. But then why the IR shows a carbonyl? Or perhaps the initial elimination forms a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, not elimination. Wait, but with two Br atoms, substitution would give a diol. But the NMR doesn't show broad peaks that would indicate OH groups. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, alternative approach: Let's look at the NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely a -OCH2 group, perhaps an ether or ester. The 1.94 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl (like a ketone group). The 2.41-2.23 (10H) are probably a series of equivalent CH2 groups in a ring structure.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, the 4.79 ppm would be the CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. But then, why the IR peak? Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but again, the IR doesn't show an O-H stretch.

Hmm, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes two eliminations, perhaps each Br is removed, and each elimination forms a double bond. Wait, but that would produce an alkene, not a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination leads to a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe it's a scenario where each Br is on adjacent carbons, and elimination leads to a conjugated diene. But without an IR peak for a C=C, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a ring opening or a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has four fused cyclohexane rings. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms on positions 1 and 3. If each Br is on a different carbon of the diamondoid structure, then elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons.

Wait, but how would that form a carbonyl group? Maybe the elimination forms a transannular double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but how? Unless the starting material has adjacent Br and a hydrogen that can be abstracted to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's a pinacol-type rearrangement, but that usually involves vicinal diols, not dihalides.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination where the two adjacent Br atoms each lose HBr, leading to a conjugated diene. But then the NMR would show peaks indicative of an alkene, like vinyl protons. But in the given NMR, there are no obvious vinyl protons.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is 1,3-dibromo-1,3-adamantane, which is a geminal dihalide. But wait, can a geminal dihalide exist on adamantane? Because each carbon in adamantane is tetrahedral, so a geminal dihalide would require two Br on the same carbon. But the name is 1,3, which suggests different carbons. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination leads to a carbonyl. For example, if each Br is on a carbon adjacent to a CH2 group, then elimination of two HBr might form a carbonyl group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the NMR data again. The IR shows a peak at 1720, so definitely a carbonyl. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. The NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), probably a CH2 next to an electronegative atom. The 1.94 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be from the adamantane structure, perhaps a ring of CH2 groups.

So putting this together, product 1 might be a diketone or an ester. But how is that formed from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, wait a second. Maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the OH- attacks a Br, but since there are two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution. But that would form a diol, but in that case, the IR would show O-H stretches, which are absent here. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a rearrangement reaction. Wait, in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the product is a carbonyl because the reaction is an oxidation. But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed elimination, but KOH is a base, not an acid. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the dihalide is undergoing a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but how? Let me think about the mechanism. If you have a dihalide where each halogen is on a carbon that's adjacent to a quaternary carbon, perhaps elimination of two HX could form a carbonyl. For example, if you have CH2Br-CBrH-..., eliminating two HBr could form a carbonyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination would form a double bond, but that doesn't directly lead to a carbonyl.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the IR peak. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. Maybe it's an ester. So if product 1 is an ester, then perhaps the reaction involves some kind of esterification. But with KOH as a base, how would that happen?

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxide attacks a Br, forming an alcohol. But then, because there are two Br atoms, perhaps two substitutions occur, but again, that would form a diol, which doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone formed via a single elimination. Wait, but with two Br atoms, perhaps a double elimination is required to form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, and elimination of two HBr forms a double bond, but then maybe a further reaction occurs. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the product is an epoxide, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's think about the next reaction. Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an acyl chloride, but no, because KOH is a base, not a chloride source. Alternatively, product 1 could be an ester, which would make sense if it's reacting with a Lewis acid for Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, product 1 has a carbonyl. So it's either a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. But considering the reagents, it's more likely an ester or ketone.

If product 1 is an ester, then heating with Al isopropoxide (AlP) could lead to a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but for that, the ester would need to be an acylating agent. Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of enol ether formation or something else.

Wait, but another possibility: Product 1 is a cyclic carbonate or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diepoxide. But again, that doesn't fit the IR.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an adamantane derivative with a ketone group. Let me think about the structure. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane, then IR would show a strong peak around 1720 cm-1, which fits. Then, the NMR would have a CH2 group adjacent to the ketone, which is around 2.1 ppm, but the given data shows 1.94 ppm (2H). Hmm, that's a bit low for a ketone adjacent CH2. Alternatively, maybe there's a CH2O group.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a gem-dialdehyde, but that's less likely given the NMR data.

Wait, another approach: The NMR data for product 1. The 4.79 (2H) could be a -OCH2O- group, as in an ether. But then why the carbonyl IR? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound, like a ketone, with adjacent CH2 groups. The 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a methylene next to an oxygen, perhaps an epoxide. Wait, but again, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. For example, if the dihalide is converted into an ester via substitution. But with KOH, that's a base, so substitution would form an alcohol, not an ester.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the overall plan. The first step is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. So maybe the product is a diene with a carbonyl group elsewhere. Or perhaps the reaction is forming a ketone via some mechanism.

Wait, another idea: If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a secondary carbon, and elimination forms a conjugated diene. Then, the diene could undergo further reaction. But with KOH, perhaps it's just the elimination step.

Wait, but the IR doesn't show a C=C peak. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane, but I don't see how the IR would show that.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to the next step and see if that gives any clues.

So, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. The Al isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid catalyst in Friedel-Crafts reactions, which are acylations or alkylations of aromatic rings. But if product 1 is an ester, perhaps product 2 is an acylated compound. But wait, product 1 could be a dienophile or something else.

Alternatively, product 1 is a diene, and with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of Diels-Alder reaction, but without an aromatic component, that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an acylated version of adamantane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the second step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. So if product 1 is an acyl chloride, but since product 1 is formed from KOH and a dihalide, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, which can undergo Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, product 1's NMR has a 4.79 (2H), which could be an -OCH2- group, perhaps in an ester. So if product 1 is an ester, then reacting with Al isopropoxide could generate an acylium ion, which could then attack another part of the molecule or another aromatic ring.

Wait, but adamantane doesn't have an aromatic ring. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the Al isopropoxide is causing a rearrangement. Maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and the Lewis acid is causing it to form an enol or undergo some acylation.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a more substituted carbonyl compound.

Wait, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is the result of acid-catalyzed ring opening. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the ozonolysis step. Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide. Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond, and product 3 would be the ozonolysis products.

So, if product 2 is a diene, ozonolysis would break both double bonds into carbonyls. Alternatively, if product 2 is a monoene, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl-containing fragments.

Wait, but the product of ozonolysis is product 3, and the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

So, perhaps product 2 has a certain structure that, upon ozonolysis, gives a specific coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a cyclopropane or a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an allene or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to map out the possible structures.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane → product 1 (with carbonyl)
Step 2: product 1 → product 2 (heated with Al isopropoxide)
Step 3: product 2 → product 3 (ozonolysis)

So, let's go back to step 1. Product 1 has a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's a ketone or ester.

If product 1 is a ketone, then step 2 involves Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. Perhaps it's causing some kind of keto-enol tautomerism or acylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation, but without an aromatic ring, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and step 2 involves its conversion into an acid chloride, but Al isopropoxide isn't typically used for that.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a dihydroxy compound. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a dehydration reaction, forming a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond, which would then undergo ozonolysis.

So, putting it all together, product 1 is a compound with a carbonyl group, product 2 is an alkene, and product 3 is the ozonolysis product with carbonyl groups.

Wait, if product 2 is an alkene, then ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

But how does that help with the NMR coupling pattern?

Let me think about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative groups or in strained environments, like near carbonyls.

In the ozonolysis product, if the molecule has carbonyl groups, the adjacent hydrogens would be deshielded. Let's say product 3 has a structure like RCO-R'CO-R''.

Wait, but considering the starting material is adamantane-based, perhaps the ozonolysis breaks a bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups attached to the adamantane structure.

Wait, another angle: the coupling pattern in NMR depends on the number of neighboring hydrogens. For example, a triplet arises from coupling with two equivalent neighboring hydrogens.

If the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a CH2 group, then it would couple with those two, leading to a triplet. Or, if it's adjacent to a CH group, it would split into a doublet.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is next to a CH2 that's next to another CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, but in product 3, after ozonolysis, the structure would have carbonyl groups. Let's think of a simple case. Suppose product 2 is an alkene, say, CH2=CH-... Then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

But considering the adamantane structure, perhaps the double bond is part of a bridge. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, creating two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two ketone groups, or maybe esters, depending on product 2.

Wait, but ozonolysis of a simple alkene gives carbonyl compounds. For example, ethylene would give two formaldehyde molecules.

But in the case of product 2, which is derived from product 1, perhaps product 2 is a substituted alkene. So, the ozonolysis would produce two carbonyl groups, each attached to the adamantane structure.

But the NMR of product 3 would show the protons near the carbonyl groups. These protons would be deshielded and might have specific coupling patterns.

Wait, another thought: If product 2 has a bridgehead double bond, ozonolysis would break the bridge, leading to two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyls, giving a structure with two ketones.

In such a case, the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups would be deshielded. Each of these hydrogens would be next to a CH2 group, perhaps, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is next to a CH group, it would be a doublet.

Wait, but if the structure after ozonolysis leads to a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the protons on that CH2 would be deshielded. Each of these protons would be split by neighboring protons.

Wait, let me imagine product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO-R, where R is part of the adamantane. The CH2 next to the carbonyl would have two protons, each coupling with the other. But if they're next to another CH2, it might lead to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded protons are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH2 is next to another CH2. So each proton on the first CH2 would couple with two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets or some other splitting.

Wait, but the options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Hmm, perhaps the most deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and this CH2 is next to another CH2. So each proton on the first CH2 is coupled with two protons on the adjacent CH2, which are themselves split into a triplet.

Wait, that would result in a triplet of triplets. Alternatively, if each proton on the first CH2 is coupled with two equivalent protons, it would be a triplet. But if those two protons are each split into a triplet, then the overall splitting would be more complex.

Wait, another possibility: The most deshielded proton is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. So, the CH group would have two neighboring protons from a CH2 group. Each of those protons would split the signal into a doublet, and each doublet would be further split by the other, leading to a doublet of doublets. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, if the CH group is next to a CH2 that is next to another CH2, the splitting could become a triplet of triplets.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the deshielded proton is on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group that's further split.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, considering that ozonolysis typically forms carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded proton would be near those groups, the coupling pattern would likely depend on the neighboring groups.

In a typical scenario, a CH2 next to a carbonyl group would have each proton coupled with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 (if any). So each proton would have two neighboring protons, giving a triplet. But if those two protons are further coupled with another set of protons, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another thought: If the deshielded proton is on a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH is next to a CH2 group, then each of the two protons on the CH2 would split the signal into a triplet. So the deshielded proton would have a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the CH group is next to a CH2 group that's itself next to another CH2, the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options include a triplet of triplets (option B) and a doublet of triplets (option C). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl, and that CH2 is next to another CH2 group which is itself next to a CH group. So the first CH2's protons would couple with the adjacent CH2's two protons, leading to a triplet, and perhaps the adjacent CH2's protons are each split into a triplet by the CH group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 group that is adjacent to a carbonyl and also adjacent to a CH group. So each proton would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2 and the one proton on the CH group. That would lead to a triplet of triplets or a pentet.

Wait, a pentet arises when a proton is coupled with four equivalent neighboring protons, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 group, which is itself adjacent to another CH2 group. So the CH proton would be split by the two protons on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet, and each of those CH2 protons is split by another group, leading to a more complex pattern.

But without the exact structure, it's challenging. However, considering the options, the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, which would arise if the deshielded proton is coupled with two protons on one adjacent group and another two protons on another adjacent group, leading to each coupling adding a split.

Wait, but another approach: The ozonolysis of a diene would produce two carbonyls. Suppose product 2 is a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis would cleave each double bond into carbonyl groups, but wait, no, a conjugated diene would break into two carbonyls. For example, 1,3-pentadiene would ozonolyze into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but in this case, product 2 is derived from product 1, which has a carbonyl. So product 2 may have a double bond adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, something like (CH2)2CO-CH2-CH2-CO-. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, product 2 could be an enone (conjugated enone), and ozonolysis would break the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups.

In that case, the product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. The CH2 groups would have protons that are deshielded, split by neighboring groups.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The most deshielded would likely be the one closest to the carbonyl group. So, perhaps the protons adjacent to the carbonyl would be deshielded.

In a typical alpha position to a carbonyl, the protons are deshielded. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring groups. For example, if each alpha proton is next to a CH2 group, each would have two neighboring protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if each of those two protons is split by another set, the pattern could be more complex. For example, a triplet of triplets if each proton is coupled with two from one group and another two from another group.

Alternatively, if the deshielded proton is part of a CH2 next to a carbonyl and also adjacent to another CH2 group, each proton would couple with the two protons from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. If the adjacent CH2 is itself split into a triplet by another group, the overall pattern could be a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to look for common coupling patterns in ozonolysis products.

Wait, ozonolysis of a simple alkene like propene would give formaldehyde. But in more complex structures, the splitting can vary. For example, ozonolysis of 2-pentene would give two carbonyl compounds, each with adjacent CH2 groups.

In such a case, the protons on the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be split by the neighboring CH2 protons, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, if the CH2 is next to another CH2 group that's further from the carbonyl, the splitting could be more complex.

Wait, another example: Suppose product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2CO-R. The CH2 closest to the carbonyl would have each proton coupled with two others (the adjacent CH2 protons), resulting in a triplet. If those adjacent CH2 protons are themselves split into triplets by another group, the most deshielded proton would be a triplet of triplets.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. However, considering the options, a triplet of triplets (option B) might be the most plausible if the deshielded proton is coupled with two sets of two protons each.

Alternatively, a doublet of triplets could arise if the deshielded proton is coupled with two protons from one group and another two from a different group, but that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded proton is adjacent to a single proton (like in a CH group) and also adjacent to a CH2 group. So, each proton on the CH would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet, and each CH2 proton would couple with the single proton, leading to a doublet. But this would result in a doublet of triplets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain. Given the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a product 3 after ozonolysis. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in the ¹H NMR spectrum of product 3.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: Formation of Product 1**  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH.  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O).  
   - The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a structure with a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen) and other CH₂ groups in a rigid adamantane framework.  
   - This strongly suggests that product 1 is a ketone, as the carbonyl group aligns with the IR data, and the NMR is consistent with a CH₂ group near a carbonyl.

2. **Reaction 2: Formation of Product 2**  
   - Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or other carbocation-mediated reactions.  
   - The exact structure of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it likely contains a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step suggests the presence of an alkene in product 2.

3. **Reaction 3: Formation of Product 3**  
   - Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl-containing products.  
   - Product 3 likely contains carbonyl groups where the double bonds in product 2 were cleaved. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be near these carbonyl groups.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen in Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, as carbonyl groups deshield nearby protons.  
   - If this hydrogen is part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, it would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet.  
   - If the adjacent CH₂ group is further coupled with another set of protons (e.g., from a neighboring CH₂ group), the splitting pattern would become more complex, such as a triplet of triplets.  
   - Considering the options, the most plausible coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is a **triplet of triplets**, arising from coupling with two protons on one adjacent group and another two protons on another adjacent group.

### Conclusion:
The coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is **triplet of triplets**.  
**Answer: B**
