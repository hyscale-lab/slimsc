Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transiting is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but they both have the same radius. Wait, same radius but different masses. So the star with higher mass (Planet_1's) would be a bit larger? Or wait, no. Oh, but same radius, so maybe Planet_2's star is a bit evolved, so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, but same size. So for transit probability, it's about the ratio of planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, and the star's radius is same for both.

Wait, the probability of transit is given by the formula: R_star is the star's radius, a is the orbital distance (semi-major axis), and the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star) multiplied by something else. Wait, I think the formula for the probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 times a function of the alignment. But another factor is the orbital
