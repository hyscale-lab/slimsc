Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, let's think through this step by step. I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its host star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the planet's orbital distance and the star's size.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which is interesting. But their orbital periods are differentâ€”Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but more massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, the stars have the same radius. That's a bit confusing. Oh, well the question says they have the same radii despite Planet_1's star being more massive. Maybe they're at different evolutionary stages or something, but I don't think that affects the transit probability.

The transit probability formula is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but since planetary radii are much smaller than the star's, it's approximately R_star / a_planet. Wait, no, more accurately, the probability P is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + sqrt((M_star / m_planet)))). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up.

Wait, no, the geometric probability for a transit is roughly (R*/a) where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because for the planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned edge-on relative to us. The probability is proportional to R*/a. So if one planet has a smaller a, the probability is higher.

But wait, let me think again. The transit probability is given by (R*/a) multiplied by the term (1/(1 + (M_star/m_planet)^(1/3))) ), but I'm not sure. Oh wait, no, maybe that's the probability in another context. Alternatively, the geometric probability is (R*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / m_planet)^(1/3))) )? No, maybe I'm mixing with the Doppler method.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. For
