Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. Since this is a two-dimensional metric, it's probably in a two-dimensional space. Wait, but pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface in anti-de Sitter space, I think. Or maybe it's a surface with constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape.

Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature. So the metric given must represent such a space. Now, the question is about finding the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2.

Wait, first, what's the radius of curvature in this context? I think the radius of curvature for a pseudosphere is related to the curvature. Oh right, for a surface with constant negative curvature, the Gaussian curvature K is negative, and the radius of curvature R is related by K = -1/R². So if R is 2, then K is -1/(4). But wait, I need to find the area, so perhaps I need to compute the area of a sphere in this space.

Wait, but in Euclidean space, the area of a sphere of radius r is 4πr². But in a pseudosphere,
