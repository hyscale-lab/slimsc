Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. 

The question is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? I remember that method is used to detect exoplanets by looking at the variations in the timing of a planet's transit across the star's disk. But I'm not sure if the detection method affects the problem here. Probably not, since the question is about orbital periods and equilibrium temperatures.

The given data points are the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 as about 2.3. So, T_eq ratio Planet1/Planet2 is 1.4, and Planet2/Planet3 is 2.3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the first ratio is Planet1 to Planet2 being 1.4. So T1/T2=1.4, and T2/T3=2.3. 

Also, the mass ratios are given. The mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So M1/M2=1.15 and M2/M3=1.35. 

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1, given that all have the same albedo of 0.3 (like Earth). 

Hmm. So I need to find the ratio P3/P1. 

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Teq = [ (L(1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4)

But I think another version of the formula, when considering the star's luminosity and the planet's distance, is that equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4). Or more accurately, since albedo (a) is given, the formula might include that. But in this problem, albedo is the same for all three planets, so a=0.3 for all. So when taking the ratio of Teq between two planets, the albedo cancels out, I think. 

So let's think. The equilibrium temperature T_eq is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4) * (1 - a)^(1/4). But since a is the same for all, the (1 - a) term is a constant factor, so when taking the ratio of two temperatures, it'll cancel. So the ratio of Teq would be [ (L1 / D1²) / (L2 / D2²) ]^(1/4).

Wait, but wait. L is the luminosity of the star, right? And for all three planets, they're orbiting the same star, so L is the same for all. Therefore, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends inversely on the square of their orbital distances, all raised to the 1/4 power.

So for Planet1 and Planet2: T1 / T2 = ( (D2²) / (D1²) )^(1/4 )

Wait, because if D1 is the distance for Planet1, and D2 for Planet2, then T1 would be proportional to (1/D1^2)^(1/4) and T2 proportional to (1/D2^2)^(1/4). So T1/T2 = (D2^2 / D1^2 )^(1/4) = (D2/D1)^(1/2). 

Wait, that's another way to see it. So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). 

So given that T1/T2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides, 1.96 = D2/D1. So D2 = 1.96 * D1. 

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3. Again, using the same formula:

T2 / T3 = sqrt(D3/D2). 

So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring both sides: 5.29 = D3/D2. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

Now, substituting D2 from earlier: D3 = 5.29 * (1.96 * D1) ) = 5.29 *1.96 * D1. Let me calculate that.

5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 * 2 is 10, but more accurately:

1.96 *5.29 = let me calculate 2*5.29=10.58, subtract 0.04*5.29=0.2116, so 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684. So D3 =10.3684 * D1.

So the distance of Planet3 is approximately 10.37 times that of Planet1.

But wait, we're asked about the orbital periods. How do the orbital periods relate to the distance? Using Kepler's third law, which in the case of a star (assuming the mass is much larger than the planet masses) is P² ∝ D³ / (M_star)^(1/3). But if all planets are orbiting the same star, then M_star is the same for all, so P^2 ∝ D^3. Therefore, P ∝ D^(3/2).

So the ratio of periods P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2). 

We have D3 = approx 10.37 * D1. So (10.37)^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3).

Let me compute 10.37^3. 

10.37^3 = (approx) 10^3 is 1000, but more precisely:

10.37 *10.37 = let's compute that. 

10 *10 is 100, 10*0.37=3.7, 0.37*10=3.7, 0.37^2=0.1369.

So (10 +0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*(10*0.37) + (0.37)^2 = 100 + 7.4 + 0.1369 = 107.5369.

Multiply by 10.37 again: 107.5369 *10.37.

I think 100 *10.37=1037; 7.5369 *10.37 ≈ let's see: 7 *10.37=72.59; 0.5369 *10.37≈5.573. So total 72.59 +5.573=78.163. So total 1037 +78.163 = 1115.163 approximately.

So 10.37^3≈1115.163. The square root of that is sqrt(1115.163). Let me find sqrt(1115). Hmm. 33^2 is 1089, 34^2 is 1156. So sqrt(1115) is between 33 and 34. Let's approximate.

33.4^2 = 33^2 + 2*33*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 1089 + 26.4 + 0.16 = 1115.56. Oh, that's very close to 1115.163. So sqrt(1115.163) is approximately 33.4. 

So (10.37)^(3/2) ≈ 33.4. 

So the ratio P3/P1 is approximately 33.4.

Looking back at the options, D is ~33.4. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait. I think I should double-check my steps because sometimes I might have mixed up the ratios.

Let me go through the steps again:

1. T1/T2 = 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). So D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 D1.

2. T2/T3=2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). So D3 = (2.3)^2 * D2 = 5.29 D2.

Substituting D2=1.96 D1, D3=5.29 *1.96 D1 = approximately 10.3684 D1.

3. Periods: P^2 ∝ D^3. So P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

As calculated earlier, (10.3684)^(3/2) ≈33.4.

So yes, the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)
   - The equilibrium temperature \( T_{\text{eq}} \) is proportional to \( \left( \frac{1}{D^2} \right)^{1/4} \), where \( D \) is the orbital distance. Since the albedo is the same for all planets, the ratio of temperatures depends only on the distances.

2. **Distance Ratios**:
   - From \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \), we have:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \implies 1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1
     \]
   - From \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \), we have:
     \[
     \frac{T_2}{T_3} = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \implies 2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \):
     \[
     D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 = 10.3684 D_1
     \]

3. **Orbital Period Ratios**:
   - According to Kepler's Third Law, \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), so:
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Substituting \( D_3 = 10.3684 D_1 \):
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Approximating \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \):
     - \( 10.3684^3 \approx 1115.163 \)
     - \( \sqrt{1115.163} \approx 33.4 \)

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1.

**Answer: D**
