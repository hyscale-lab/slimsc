Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

An alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud built a super fast spacecraft. The average lifetime of their people is about 150 Earth years. They plan to send a 22-year-old astronaut to Earth at a constant speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The question is, from the astronaut's point of view, how long will the trip take? The options are A to D, with A suggesting the astronaut dies before reaching.

Hmm, right. So this has to do with special relativity, specifically time dilation. Time dilation occurs when an object is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, which affects the passage of time for that object relative to a stationary observer.

Wait, but in this case, we're looking at the astronaut's perspective. So from their frame of reference, the trip should take less time, right? Because of length contraction. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think step by step.

First, I need to find the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but I think the LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Let's approximate it as about 170,000 light-years. So the distance is roughly 1.7e5 light-years.

But wait, the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. That's extremely close to the speed of light. So the time from Earth's perspective would be distance divided by speed. Let me calculate that.

Time from Earth's frame (t0) = distance / speed = (170,000 ly) / (0.99999987 c). Since 1 ly is the distance light travels in a year, the units will cancel, and t0 will be in years.

Calculating that: 170,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 170,000 * (1/0.99999987). What's 1/0.99999987? Let me approximate. Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013, because (1 - x)^-1 ≈ 1 + x for small x. Here, x is 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013. So, 1/(0.99999987) ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 = 1.00000013. So t0 is about 170,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 170,000 + (170,000 * 0.00000013). Let's compute 170,000 * 0.00000013. 170,000 * 1.3e-7 = 170,000 * 1.3e-7 = 0.0221. So t0 is about 170,000.0221 years. So from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 170,000 years.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait a second. No, wait, the distance is 170,000 light-years, so if you go at nearly the speed of light, the time taken is roughly the distance divided by speed. So 170,000 ly / 0.99999987c = approx 170,000 / (0.99999987) years. Wait, but 1 ly is 1 light-year, so moving at 0.99999987c would take nearly (1 / 0.99999987) years to cover 1 ly. So for 170,000 ly, it's about 170,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 170,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 170,000.0221 years. So about 170,000 years.

But the astronaut is on the spacecraft. So from their frame, they experience less time due to time dilation. The time experienced by the astronaut (t) is t0 multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma. Wait, no, wait. Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, v²/c² is (0.99999987)^2. Let's calculate that: (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051 (since 0.00051^2 is 0.0000002601). So gamma is 1/0.00051 ≈ 1960.7843.

So gamma is approximately 1960.8. So the time experienced by the astronaut is t = t0 / gamma. Wait, wait: no, wait. From the Earth frame, the time is t0 ≈ 170,000 years. The astronaut's proper time is t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t0 / gamma. So, t ≈ 170,000 / 1960.8 ≈ let's compute that. 170,000 / 2000 is 85, so 170,000 / 1960.8 is a bit less. Let's compute 170,000 / 1960.8.

Calculate 1960.8 * 86 = 1960.8 *80=156,864; 1960.8*6=11,764.8 → total 168,628.8. 1960.8*87=168,628.8 +1960.8= 170,589.6. So 86.5 would be about 86.5 *1960.8. Let me compute 86 *1960.8= 168,628.8; 0.5 *1960.8=980.4. So 86.5 → 168,628.8 +980.4=169,609.2. So 86.5 *1960.8 is 169,609.2. But 170,000 is 390.8 higher. So how much more? 390.8 /1960.8 ≈ approx 0.2. So 86.5 + 0.2=86.7. So t ≈ 86.7 years.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate 170,000 divided by 1960.8 exactly. Using a calculator approach:

1960.8 × 86 = 168,628.8 → as before. 170,000 - 168,628.8 = 1,371.2. So 1,371.2 / 1960.8 ≈ 0.699, so 86.7 years approx. So about 86.7 years.

But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old. 86.7 years added to 22 would make him 108, but the average lifetime is 150 years. So he would live longer than that. So he'd reach Earth before dying, right? So option A is "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth." That would be wrong because he's 22, and the trip takes about 86 years. So 22 + 86 = 108, which is less than 150. So he should live.

So the options are:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching.

B)72

C)81

D)77

Wait, my calculation was about 86.7 years, which is approximately 87, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me double-check. v is 0.99999987c. So v squared is (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7. The square root of that is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that more accurately.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6)= approx 1.612. 1e-3.5 is same as 1e-3 * 1e-0.5 → approx 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 0.000509. So gamma is 1 / 0.000509 ≈ 1964. So approximately 1964.

So t0 is 170,000 years. So proper time t is t0 / gamma = 170,000 / 1964 ≈ let me compute this.

1964 × 86 = 1964 *80=157,120; 1964 *6=11,784 → sum 168,904. 1964 × 87 = 168,904 +1964 = 170,868. But 170,000 is between 86 and 87 times 1964. So the exact value would be 170,000 / 1964 ≈ approximately 86.47 years.

So around 86.5 years. But the astronaut is 22, so 22 + 86.5 = 108.5 years. Since the average lifetime is 150, he would live, so option A is incorrect.

But the options given don't have 86.5. The closest is option C) 81, but that's not close. So perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Wait, wait, wait. Oh wait! The problem says the Large Magellanic Cloud, but I assumed distance is about 170,000 ly. Let me check: the actual distance to the LMC is roughly about 160,000 ly, sometimes stated as about 170,000. So perhaps 163,000 ly. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the time from the astronaut's perspective using length contraction. Because from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted.

So the proper length (from Earth's frame) is L0 = 163,000 ly. The astronaut measures a contracted length, L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) = L0 / gamma. So L = 163,000 / 1964 ≈ 83.1 ly.

Wait, no: L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = L0 / gamma. So 163,000 / 1964 ≈ 83.1 ly. So the time experienced by the astronaut is L / v. Since v is 0.99999987c, which is about 1c for all practical purposes.

So, time t = (83.1 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since light travels 1 ly per year, the time is approximately 83.1 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.1 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.1001 years. So about 83 years.

Wait, but earlier calculation using time dilation gave 86.5 years, and this one gives about 83. Hmm. Which approach is correct?

Ah, because in special relativity, both approaches should give the same result. Maybe I made a mistake in the first approach.

Wait, time from Earth's frame is t0 = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000.013 years.

And the astronaut's time is t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000.013 * 0.000509 ≈ 82.9 years.

Wait, that's about 83 years. So that aligns with the length contraction approach.

Wait, why the discrepancy in the first calculation? Oh, because I think I messed up the first calculation. Let me recalculate that.

Earlier, I did 170,000 / 1960.8 ≈ 86.7. But if the distance is 163,000 ly, then t0 is 163,000 / 0.99999987 → approx 163,000.013 years.

Then, t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000.013 * 0.000509 ≈ let me compute 163000 * 0.000509. 163000 * 0.0005 is 81.5. 163000 * 0.000009 = 1.467. So total is 81.5 + 1.467 = 82.967. So about 83 years.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years. So the options are: option C is 81, D is 77, B is 72. So 83 is closer to 81, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait but perhaps I should consider that the actual distance is closer to 170,000 ly, but maybe I should not use 170,000 as the distance. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the approximation that at v ≈ c, time is distance (in light-years) divided by gamma.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.99999987c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².

So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 → let's compute that.

0.99999987^2 = ?

Well, (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + negligible, so 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.099e-4 ≈ 1962.

So using the Earth frame time:

t0 = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000 + (163,000 * 1.3e-7) → 163,000 + 0.02119 → 163,000.02119 years.

Then t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 163,000.02119 * 5.099e-4 ≈ let's compute 163,000 * 5.099e-4.

163,000 * 0.0005099 → 163,000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, 163,000 * 0.0000099 is approximately 1.6137. So total is 81.5 + 1.6137 ≈ 83.1137 years.

So about 83.1 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is C)81, but that's about 2 years off. Alternatively, perhaps the distance is considered as 180,000 ly, which would make a difference.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the exact gamma.

v = 0.99999987 c.

So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 )

Compute (0.99999987)^2:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 → 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 → approx 0.9999997400000169.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) = 0.0005099 approximately.

Gamma ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 = 1961.18.

So, if the distance is L = 163,000 ly.

Time in Earth frame: t0 = L / v = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000*(1 + 1.3e-7) → 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-7 → 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

Astronaut's time: t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → 163,000.021 * 0.0005099 → same as before, about 83.11 years.

Hmm, but the options don't have 83. So perhaps the problem assumes that the time is approximately 81 years, but that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using v=0.9999c, which would have a gamma of about 70.9, leading to a shorter time.

Wait, but the speed here is 0.99999987c, which is super close to c. So gamma is about 1960, which makes the time experienced about 83 years.

But none of the options are close to 83. So perhaps I miscalculated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the distance of 100,000 light-years. Let me assume that. No, the LMC is about 160,000 ly away, but perhaps the problem takes a different value. Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the Milky Way's size or another figure. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it with v = 0.999999c, which would have a gamma of about 220, but that's a different number.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the astronaut is 22, and if the trip takes about 83 years, then 22 +83=105, which is under 150, so he'll live. So the answer is not A.

But the options don't have 83, but they have options like 77 and 81. Maybe I should recalculate with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the distance from the astronaut's perspective. From their frame, the distance is contracted. So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) → L = L0 / gamma.

So, t = L / v = (L0 / gamma) / v = L0 / (v * gamma).

But L0 is the distance in Earth's frame, which is 163,000 ly.

v is 0.99999987c, so v * gamma = 0.99999987c * 1961.18 ≈ (0.99999987 * 1961.18) c.

Calculating 0.99999987 * 1961.18 → approximately 1961.18 * (1 - 1.3e-7) → 1961.18 - 1961.18 * 1.3e-7 → approx 1961.18 - 0.000255 → 1961.179745.

So v * gamma ≈ 1961.179745 c.

Then, t = L0 / (v * gamma) → 163,000 ly / (1961.179745 c) → since 1 ly / c is 1 year, so t = 163,000 / 1961.179745 ≈ 83.11 years.

Same result as before.

Hmm. So the correct time is about 83 years. But the options are 72, 77, 81, or 83 is approx 81, but not exact. So perhaps the problem expects the use of a different distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the average distance as 150,000 ly, which would give t0 = 150,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 150,000.015 years.

t = 150,000.015 * 0.0005099 ≈ 150,000 *0.0005099=76.485, plus 0.015 *0.0005099≈0.0000765 → about 76.485 years. So that's approximately 76.485, which is close to 77 years. So if the distance is 150,000 ly, the time would be about 76.5 years.

So in that case, the astronaut would experience about 76.5 years. Which is option D, 77 years.

But why would the problem use 150,000 ly as the distance? The LMC is about 160,000 ly away, but maybe the problem approximates it.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is 170,000 ly, but I have a miscalculation elsewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculation again with 170,000 ly.

Gamma is 1961.18.

t = 170,000 / 1961.18 → 170000 ÷ 1961.18.

Compute 1961.18 * 86 = 168,  let me calculate 1961.18 × 80 = 156,894.4; 1961.18 ×6 = 11,767.08 → total 168,661.48. 170,000 - 168,661.48 = 1,338.52.

1,338.52 ÷ 1961.18 ≈ 0.683. So 86.683 years.

So about 86.7 years, which as before. So if the distance is 170,000, the time is 86.7 years, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.99999987c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt( 1 - ( (1 - 1.3e-7 )^2 ) )

= 1 / sqrt( 1 - ( 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 ) )

= 1 / sqrt( 2.6e-7 - (1.3e-7)^2 )

≈ 1 / sqrt( 2.6e-7 )

= 1/(5.099e-4) ≈ 1961.18.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to use the approximation gamma ≈ 1/(v/c) * c / (sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2)) )? No, that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of a different formula, such as t = t0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2 ), which is correct.

But regardless, the time is around 83 or 76, depending on the assumed distance.

In the options, the closest is D)77 or C)81.

But the problem says "the Large Magellanic Cloud", so the distance is about 160,000 ly. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem doesn't require knowing the actual distance. Maybe it's a trick question.

Wait, the speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be approximately the distance divided by c, multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But without the actual distance, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Wait, the question is about how long the astronaut will experience. The options are in the range of 72-81 years. 

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation for v approaching c, where t ≈ L / (c * gamma), and gamma is about 1/(v/c). Because when v is very close to c, 1 - v/c is very small.

Wait, let me think. As v approaches c, gamma approaches 1/(sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))) approximately, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, when v is 0.99999987c, then 1 - v/c = 1.3e-7.

Wait, perhaps I can model gamma as 1/(sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))) → but that's an approximation when v is near c. Let me see:

v/c=0.99999987 → 1 - v/c = 1.3e-7.

So sqrt(2*(1 - v/c))=sqrt(2.6e-7)≈5.099e-4. So gamma ≈ 1/ (5.099e-4) ≈1961.18.

Same as before.

So, regardless, the time is about 83 years with the actual distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick and the time is about 22 years, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem expects us to realize that the speed is so high that the time experienced is very small, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance as 100,000 ly. Then, t0=100,000 /0.99999987 ≈ 100,000.013 years.

t = 100,000.013 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 50.99 years → about 51 years. Which is not an option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for time dilation incorrectly. Maybe they think that the time experienced is t0 * v/c, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time experienced as t = L / (v * gamma).

Wait, earlier calculation for L=163,000 ly:

t = 163,000 / (0.99999987 * 1961.18 ) → 163,000 /1961.179 → approximately 83.1 years.

Hmm.

But the problem options don't include 83. So perhaps the intended answer is D)77, which would be if the distance is 150,000 ly.

So, perhaps the problem assumes the distance is about 150,000 ly. So t = 150,000 / 1961.18 ≈76.48 years, which rounds to 77, option D.

So the answer would be D.

But wait, the problem says 'approximate', so perhaps 77 is the intended answer.

But earlier, I thought the time was about 83, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is that, using gamma of approximately 220. Wait, no, wait: wait, wait, perhaps I'm confusing 0.9999c with 0.99999987c.

Wait, what is gamma when v=0.9999c?

At v=0.9999c, v²/c²=0.99980001.

1 - v²/c²=0.00019999.

sqrt(0.00019999)=≈0.014142.

gamma=1/0.014142≈70.71.

Wait, so for v=0.9999c, gamma is ~70.71.

So the time would be t0/gamma.

If the distance is 170,000 ly:

t0=170,000/0.9999≈170,017 years.

t=170,017 /70.71≈2398. So that's way too big.

That can't be. So perhaps that's not the approach.

Wait, no, because when using v=0.9999c, the time would be longer, but in our problem the speed is even higher (0.99999987c), which leads to a much higher gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach. Maybe it's not considering the distance correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the distance as the distance that light would travel in the astronaut's lifetime, but that would be different.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, so from their perspective, Earth is moving towards them at 0.99999987c. The distance is contracted, so L= L0 * sqrt(1 -v²/c²). So L= L0 / gamma.

Time t = L /v = (L0 / gamma ) / v → L0/(v gamma).

But L0 is the distance to Earth, say 163,000 ly.

So t=163,000 / (0.99999987 * 1961.18 ) → 163,000/(1961.179) ≈83.11 years.

So if the problem gives options of 72,77,81, etc., none match. So perhaps the intended answer is that the astronaut does reach Earth, but the time is about 83 years, which isn't an option. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects you to compute the time as the distance divided by speed, but without considering relativity from the astronaut's perspective. But that would give t0 = 163,000/0.99999987 ≈163,000.02 years, which is way longer than the astronaut's lifetime, but that's not the case because the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. Wait, no, wait: the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years, but from Earth's perspective, the trip takes 163,000 years, so the astronaut would have died long before.

Wait, but wait, no. That's from Earth's frame of reference. From the astronaut's frame, the trip takes about 83 years, so he would reach Earth alive.

Ah, so the options are:

A: die before.

B:72

C:81

D:77.

So the correct answer is that the astronaut doesn't die, so A is incorrect.

So the time is about 83, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is that the astronaut will live, so the correct option is not A, but the closest time is 81 or 77.

Wait, but the options don't include 83, so perhaps the intended answer is that the trip takes about 81 years. So option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me compute 1 - v²/c².

v = 0.99999987c → v² = (0.99999987)^2 c².

So, 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7.

So, (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2 ≈ 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14.

So, 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7 - 1.69e-14 ≈2.59999983e-7.

So, sqrt(2.59999983e-7) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4.

So, gamma = 1 /5.099e-4 ≈1961.18.

So, t = L0 / (gamma * v) → L0 is 163,000 ly.

v=0.99999987c.

So,

gamma * v = 1961.18 * 0.99999987 ≈ 1961.18*(1 -1.3e-7) → 1961.18 - (1961.18 *1.3e-7) → 1961.18 - 0.00025495 → 1961.17974505.

So, gamma * v ≈1961.17974505.

So, t = 163,000 / 1961.17974505 ≈83.11 years.

Hmm.

So, given that, I think the problem expects the answer to be approximately 83 years, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is not present, but the closest is C)81.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of approximate calculations without considering the exact distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D)77, assuming a different distance.

But without knowing the exact distance used in the problem, it's hard to say, but I think the intended answer is D)77, because in some cases, using a distance of 150,000 ly would give t ≈76.5, which rounds to 77.

So, despite my confusion, I think the intended answer is D)77.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the trip to Earth, we analyze the problem using principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), and the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is approximately \( 163,000 \) light-years (ly). The astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Time in Earth's Frame (\( t_0 \)):**
   The time taken for the trip from Earth's perspective is:
   \[
   t_0 = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 163,000.02 \, \text{years}.
   \]

2. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \)):**
   The Lorentz factor is given by:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \), we find:
   \[
   \gamma \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 1961.18.
   \]

3. **Proper Time Experienced by the Astronaut (\( t \)):**
   The proper time experienced by the astronaut is:
   \[
   t = \frac{t_0}{\gamma}.
   \]
   Substituting \( t_0 \approx 163,000.02 \, \text{years} \) and \( \gamma \approx 1961.18 \):
   \[
   t \approx \frac{163,000.02}{1961.18} \approx 83.11 \, \text{years}.
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** "The astronaut will die before reaching Earth."  
  The astronaut is 22 years old, and the trip takes approximately 83 years. Adding 83 years to 22 years gives a total age of 105 years, which is less than the average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the trip, making this option incorrect.

- **Option B:** \( 72 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is significantly lower than the calculated proper time of 83 years. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option C:** \( 81 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is close to the calculated proper time of 83 years. However, it is still not exact.

- **Option D:** \( 77 \, \text{years} \)  
  This is also close to the calculated proper time but slightly less accurate than 81 years.

### Conclusion:
The calculated proper time is approximately 83 years, but since this value is not among the options, the closest available answer is **C) 81 years**. This discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.
