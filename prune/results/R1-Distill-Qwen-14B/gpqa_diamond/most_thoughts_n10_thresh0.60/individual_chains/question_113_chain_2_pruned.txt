Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let me read the question again. The unknown compound has been characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll go through each of these and see what information they provide.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around this region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical O-H stretching for alcohols (which is usually around 3200-3600). But maybe it's a different functional group. Alternatively, it could be an N-H stretch, but the problem doesn't mention amines. Hmm. Wait, another possibility is that it's an O-H from a carbonyl group. Like in a ketone or aldehyde? No, those don't have O-H. Oh, wait, maybe an ester or something else.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is a strong peak, which is a common region for carbonyl groups. That's probably a ketone or an aldehyde, but aldehydes usually have higher wavenumbers, maybe around 1720. Alternatively
