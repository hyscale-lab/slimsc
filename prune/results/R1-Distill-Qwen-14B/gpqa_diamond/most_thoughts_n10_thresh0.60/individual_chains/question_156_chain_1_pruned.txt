Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about the reactions of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then combining the products and running them on HPLC columns. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used as oxidizing agents, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the geometry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Let me break down each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. Since (E) is the trans configuration, the epoxidation should form an epoxide where the oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a trans fashion. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when mCPBA adds across the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. Oh right, for alkenes, the epoxidation via mCPBA leads to a cis addition. Because the peracid attacks from the same face, leading to a trans epoxide?

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify. For a trans (E) alkene, adding mCPBA would form an epoxide. The peracid adds across the double bond, and the two new oxygen bonds form on the same face. So, for an E-alkene, the groups on either end of the double bond are opposite. So, let's imagine oct-4-ene as CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. For E, the substituents (probably CH2CH2CH2CH3 on each end) are opposite.

Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no, wait. Let's structure it properly.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think: octane has 8 carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure for oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be. Wait, no, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not right. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps I should think in terms of the double bond between carbons 4 and 5.

Wait, oct-4
