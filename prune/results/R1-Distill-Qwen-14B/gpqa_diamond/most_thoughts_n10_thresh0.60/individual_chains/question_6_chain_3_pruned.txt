Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, potentials often lead to specific types of equations, like the Schrödinger equation, and sometimes you can separate variables.

The potential given is V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, that looks like a combination of a harmonic oscillator part and maybe an angular part. Let me think about this. I remember that in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian can sometimes be split into radial and angular parts when the potential depends on r and θ in a certain way.

So, the particle is in two dimensions, so the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates should apply here. The general form for the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates is something like:

H = (-ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r²) ∂²/∂r² (r²) + (1/(r² sinθ)) ∂²/∂θ² (sinθ) ) ] + V(r,θ)

Wait, but the potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor that. Oh, I see, it's (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, no, 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos^2θ can be written as (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ) k r². Hmm, that's (1 + 3 cos²θ) (k r²/2). Or maybe I should factor it differently. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the potential can be expressed in a way that separates into radial and angular parts.

Wait, the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the r²:

V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ].

Hmm, but the angular part is 1 + 3 cos²θ. I wonder if that's expressible in terms of something else. Oh wait, maybe I can express it using the double-angle identity. Because I know that cos²
