Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again. 

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions using different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are enantiomers of each other. The products are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. 

The options for starting materials A and B are various compounds, all of which are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with different stereochemistry.

So, I remember that the stereochemistry of the starting material affects the product in certain reactions. Here, the reactions are reductions using LiBH4 and BH3. 

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually for carbonyl groups. BH3 is typically used for ketone reductions too, but I think maybe in different conditions. Wait, in the presence of other things like H2O or something else? Maybe not relevant here. 

The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone, specifically a lactone, I believe. Pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen. So, the ring is formed by the esterification of a carboxylic acid and an alcohol group in the same molecule, right? So, the starting material must have an ester or an acid that can form a lactone upon reduction or other reaction. 

Wait, wait. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, that's a pentanoic acid with substituents. Let's see: pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, 3-ethyl would be an ethyl group on the third carbon. 5-isobutoxy would be an isobutoxy group (OCH(CH2CH3)2) on the fifth carbon. And 5-oxo refers to a ketone group (O) on the fifth carbon.

Wait, that can't be. Because pentanoic acid's structure is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the fifth carbon is the carboxylic acid. Hmm, wait maybe the numbering is different. Maybe it's 5-oxo pentanoic acid. Let me think: the structure would have the COOH at one end, then on the fifth carbon (if it's pentanoic acid, 5 carbons in total). But that's the same as the COOH, so maybe I got the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a four-carbon chain with substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like:

COOH-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no. Let me think. The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Let me number from the COOH end. So position 1: COOH, position 2: CH2, position 3: CH2, position 4: CH2, position 5: CH3? Wait, that can't be right because the substituents are on 3 and 5.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Position 1: COOH
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: CH(CH2CH3) (because of 3-ethyl)
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: OCH(CH2CH3)2 (isobutoxy) and also a ketone (oxo) on position 5. But position 5 is the last carbon before the COOH. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the COOH is on position 1. Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

Structure: 
O
||
O=C-OCH(CH2CH3)2 (that's the isobutoxy group)
 attached to a CH2 group, then another CH2, then CH(CH2CH3), then CH2COOH?

Wait, maybe it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no. Let me try to draw it out.

Pentanoic acid: 5 carbons, COOH on C-1.

So, the structure:

C1: COOH

C2: CH2

C3: CH(CH2CH3) [3-ethyl]

C4: CH2

C5: C(O-) ?

Wait, but the substituents are on C3 and C5.

Wait, but C5 is the last carbon. So, how can it have both isobutoxy and oxo groups?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

C1: COOH

C2: CH2

C3: CH(CH2CH3)

C4: CH2

C5: C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2) 

Wait, but then C5 would have an ester group, right? Because it's O-isobutoxy attached to the carbonyl.

So, the structure is 5-oxo-pentanoic acid, with isobutoxy ester at C5 and ethyl substitution at C3.

Wait, maybe the molecule is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid has a ketone at C5, and an isobutoxy group at C5? Or perhaps a lactone ring?

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)-COOH

Wait, but that would make C5 the COOH, which can't have a substituent. Hmm, maybe I should focus more on the reaction.

The products are tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one derivatives. Structure-wise, that's a six-membered ring, with an oxygen, and a ketone (the 2-one). So, the ring is formed from the esterification of a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group, but wait, in this case, the starting material is an acid.

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, you get an alcohol. But in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester, and upon reduction, it forms an alcohol that cyclizes.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a ring closure after some reduction.

Wait, another approach: think about the mechanism of the reactions. The starting materials are being treated with LiBH4 and BH3, which are both reducing agents. 

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces esters to alcohols. Wait, no, esters are reduced to alcohols via LiAlH4, but LiBH4 might not reduce esters. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: LiBH4 can reduce ketones and aldehydes, but not esters. Wait, no, I think esters are reduced by LiAlH4 to give alcohols. LiBH4 doesn't usually reduce esters. But in some cases, maybe under certain conditions, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. So perhaps the starting material is an ester which, upon reduction, becomes a diol that cyclizes to form a ring.

Wait, no. Let me think: The starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. When treated with a reducing agent, perhaps the ester group is being reduced. But wait, they're using LiBH4 and BH3. 

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a ketone ester. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol, and the ester becomes a primary alcohol. Then, perhaps the diol formed can undergo cyclization to form a ring. 

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm. Maybe the reaction isn't a reduction of the ester, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition or some kind of keto-enol tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a carbonyl that, upon reduction, forms an alcohol which then cyclizes to form a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, but that seems unrelated.

Wait, another approach. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is six-membered, with one oxygen. The ketone is at position 2. So, the structure is:

O
||
C2
/   \
C1    C3
|     |
O--C4--C5-C6

But perhaps it's a five-membered ring? No, the question says pyran, which is six-membered.

Wait, another thought. The product is a cyclic ketone formed via a reduction. The starting material must have a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms a secondary alcohol which then undergoes some kind of cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are used. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers. So, the two reactions produce opposite configurations in the product.

So, the starting materials A and B, when reduced, give opposite configurations at a certain stereocenter. Therefore, the starting materials must have opposite configurations that would lead to the opposite configurations in the product.

But what's the configuration in the product? The product is (R) or (S) at the 4-position of the tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyl. So, the ethyl group is on carbon 4 of the ring. The configuration is R or S at that carbon.

So, the reduction must lead to the formation of a stereocenter at C4. Thus, the starting material must have a carbonyl adjacent to a stereogenic center that, upon reduction, becomes a chiral center.

Wait, but the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the pentanoic acid has a ketone (5-oxo) and an isobutoxy group on the same carbon (C5), and an ethyl group on C3.

Wait, so the structure is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - CH2 - C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2 )

Wait, that can't be, because the numbering would have the COOH at C1, so C5 would be the last carbon. Hmm, maybe it's:

COOH
|
CH2
|
CH(CH2CH3)
|
CH2
|
C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2 )

So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2 )

But wait, that makes the C5 the carbonyl with the isobutoxy group. So, the molecule is a pentanoic acid with an ester group on the same carbon as a ketone? That doesn't make sense because a ketone and ester on the same carbon would imply a geminal diester or something, which isn't possible.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let's think about the IUPAC name: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. The substituents are on C3 and C5.

So, C3: ethyl group.

C5: isobutoxy and oxo groups.

Wait, but pentanoic acid has five carbons, so C5 is the COOH group. Hmm, that can’t have substituents. So perhaps the numbering is from the other end.

Wait, perhaps in the IUPAC name, the substituents are numbered from the end that gives the lowest numbers. So, the COOH is on C1, and the substituents are on C3 and C5.

But C5 would be the same as the COOH, which can't have substituents beyond the COOH. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2) - CH2 ?

Wait, no, that would make it six carbons, but it's pentanoic acid. Maybe the structure is:

CH2(COOH) – CH2 – CH(CH2CH3) – C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, but that would be four carbons, not five. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure.

The key point is that when the starting materials A and B are treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, they produce enantiomers. So, the starting materials must have opposite configurations at a certain stereocenter, leading to opposite configurations in the product.

But wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. They might affect the reaction differently, perhaps leading to different stereochemical outcomes.

Wait, LiBH4 is a bulky reducing agent. It might lead to anti-Markovnikov addition, or perhaps the reaction proceeds with some stereochemical control. BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, which have their own stereochemistry.

Ah, hydroboration! Oh wait, wait. When using BH3, perhaps it's a hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which typically follows anti-Markovnikov addition and has a certain stereochemistry, like in the case of ketones.

Wait, no, hydroboration-oxidation is for alkenes. But in this case, the starting material is a ketone ester. Hmm, perhaps the reaction is a ketone reduction. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, they have a ketone (5-oxo) group and an ester group (5-isobutoxy). So, the structure is a pentanoic acid with an ester on C5 and a ketone on C5? That doesn't make sense because in a pentanoic acid, C5 is the COOH. So maybe the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but the name doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a β-keto ester. A β-keto ester would have the structure RCO-COOR'. So, in this case, the starting material could be a β-keto ester. That would make sense because β-keto esters can undergo various reductions.

So, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, then when it's reduced, the ketone group would be converted to an alcohol. But wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are used. Maybe in different solvents or conditions.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the ester part remains, and the ketone is reduced, but that wouldn't form a ring. Hmm, perhaps the starting material has both a ketone and an ester in such a way that upon reduction, a ring is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester, but that's not indicated in the name.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction mechanism. Let's suppose the starting material is a β-keto ester. So, it has the structure:

RCOO-COR'

When reduced, the ketone (COR') becomes CH2OR', and the ester (RCOO-) remains.

But wait, LiBH4 can reduce the ketone to a primary alcohol. So, in the case of a β-keto ester, the reduction would give RCOO-CH2-O-R'.

Wait, but how does that form a ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester or something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a Claisen condensation or something similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, and upon reduction, the ring opens and something else happens. But I'm not getting it.

Wait, perhaps it's more straightforward. The product is a cyclic ketone. So, the starting material must be a γ-keto acid or something that can form a ring upon reduction.

Wait, but the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, a six-membered ring. For that, the starting material must have a chain that can cyclize into a six-membered ring upon reduction.

Wait, the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents. So, perhaps the chain is such that upon reduction, an alcohol is formed which can attack the carbonyl group to form a ring.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the stereochemistry aspect.

The two reactions produce enantiomers. So, the starting materials must differ in their configuration, leading to opposite configurations in the product.

The starting materials are A and B. When A is reduced with LiBH4, it gives (R)-product. When B is reduced with BH3, it gives (S)-product. Or the other way around.

Wait, the question states:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-product

B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-product

So, the two different reagents are used on A and B to give opposite configurations.

So, the reducing agents might affect the stereochemistry of the product.

Wait, but what's the role of the reducing agents in the stereochemistry? LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and is typically used for reductions of esters, but I'm not sure about the stereochemistry.

Wait, in the reduction of ketones, the stereochemistry is determined by the mechanism. For example, in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride can approach from either face, leading to racemization. But in some cases, like with hindered reducing agents, the approach might be more controlled.

Wait, but in the case of hydroboration, BH3 adds in a way that the boron attaches to the less substituted carbon in a concerted manner, following anti-Markovnikov and with a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but here the starting material isn't an alkene. It's a ketone. So perhaps the reaction is a ketone reduction.

Wait, when using BH3 as a reducing agent for a ketone, perhaps it's a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a reduction of an ester to an alcohol, with the stereochemistry determined by the reducing agent.

Wait, but LiBH4 doesn't usually reduce esters. LiAlH4 does. So, if the starting material is an ester, LiBH4 wouldn't reduce it. So, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the ester is another functional group that doesn't react in this condition.

Wait, maybe the ester is in the starting material, but the reaction is reducing the ketone.

Hmm. Let me think about the product. The product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ketone is converted to an alcohol, which then forms a ring with the ester.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction of the ketone, would form an enol, which can cyclize to form a ring.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has both a ketone and an ester group, and upon reducing the ketone, a diol is formed which can cyclize into a ring.

Wait, perhaps the reducing agent adds a hydride to the ketone, converting it into an alcohol. The ester then could act as a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a conjugate addition. But I'm not getting anywhere.

Let me think about the options. The options A, B, C, D give different configurations for A and B.

The product from A is (R) configuration, and from B is (S). 

Assuming that the starting material's configuration determines the product's configuration. So, if A is (R) and B is (S), or vice versa.

Wait, but the product's configuration at C4 is determined by the starting material's configuration at a certain position.

Assuming that during the reduction, the configuration is inverted or retained.

Wait, if the starting material is a β-keto ester, then upon reduction, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. The configuration at that center would depend on the reduction.

But in a reduction, if the ketone is R or S, the reduction to the alcohol would follow certain stereochemistry based on the reducing agent.

Wait, but ketones are planar, so when reduced, the resulting alcohol's configuration is determined by the approach of the hydride.

If the reducing agent approaches from a certain face, the configuration would be R or S.

Wait, for LiBH4, which is a bulky reducing agent, perhaps it leads to a certain configuration, like more preference for a certain face.

But if the starting material's configuration is R, and the reducing agent adds in a certain way, the product's configuration would be determined.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center, and the reduction leads to the opposite configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a chiral β-keto ester. When reduced, the configuration at the new stereocenter (the former ketone) is determined by the starting material's configuration.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the product's structure.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, the ethyl group is at position 4.

The ring is six-membered. The ketone is at position 2. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C2
C1 - C3
|    |
O--C4 - C5 - C6

Wait, no, more accurately, the ring is formed by the esterification of a hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid group in the starting material.

Wait, but the starting material is a pentanoic acid derivative. So, perhaps the product is formed via a lactone formation after reduction.

Wait, but how?

Another approach: the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which suggests that it was formed via a Robinson annulation or similar process, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, which then undergoes condensation with the carboxylic acid to form a ring.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so maybe the ester is reduced to an alcohol, which then forms the ring with another part of the molecule.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me consider the options.

Looking at the options, all the starting materials are either R or S configuration in 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, perhaps the configuration at C3 or C5 affects the product's configuration.

Wait, in the product, the configuration is at C4 (the ethyl group). So, the starting material must have a configuration that affects C4.

Hmm. Let me think about the possible reaction mechanism.

Suppose the starting material is a β-keto ester. The structure would be:

RCO-COOR'

When reduced, the ketone (RCO-) would become RCH(OH)-, and the ester (COOR') would become CH2OR'.

Wait, but how does that form a ring?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester, with the structure:

RCO-CH2-COOR'

Then, reducing the ketone would give RCH(OH)-CH2-COOR', which might cyclize.

Wait, maybe the ester group would attack the hydroxyl group to form a ring.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone, and the reducing agent converts it into an alcohol. The ester group then undergoes ring closure with the alcohol.

Wait, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed by the reduction of a ketone in the starting material, leading to an alcohol which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring, incorporating the ester group.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is:

CH2(COOH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2 )

But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2-COOH
|
CH(CH2CH3)
|
CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2 )

But again, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ring remains but the ketone is converted to an alcohol, which then forms the product.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about how the stereochemistry is determined.

Assume that the starting material has a chiral center at C3. When reduced, the configuration at that center determines the configuration of the product's C4.

So, if the starting material is (R) configuration at C3, the product would be (R) or (S) at C4, depending on the reaction.

But with different reducing agents, perhaps the configuration is inverted or not.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different reducing agents. LiBH4 is a hydride source, while BH3 is typically used in hydroboration. Could that affect the approach of the hydride and thus the stereochemistry?

Wait, but in the case of ketone reduction, the approach of the hydride from either face would determine the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

If the starting material is a chiral β-keto ester, the reduction would involve the ketone, which is a planar sp2 hybridized carbon. So, the approach of the hydride from either face would lead to the R or S configuration in the product.

But the starting material's configuration would influence the position of substituents, which in turn would influence the approach of the hydride.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's configuration creates a more favorable approach for the hydride from a particular face, leading to a certain configuration in the product.

So, if the starting material is (R) configuration, the hydride might approach from the less hindered face, leading to the (R) product when using LiBH4, and from the opposite face when using BH3, leading to (S).

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents have different selectivities in terms of the face they approach.

But wait, LiBH4 is a bulky reducing agent. It might approach from the less hindered face, leading to the formation of a certain configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with BH3 (which is more like hydroboration) would proceed with a certain stereochemistry, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion, or vice versa, depending on the reaction.

But in the case of ketone reduction to secondary alcohols, the product's stereochemistry is determined by the approach of the hydride ion.

If the starting material is a β-keto ester with a certain configuration, the approach of the hydride (from LiBH4 or BH3) would be determined by the steric environment, leading to the product's configuration.

But I'm still not entirely clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something that upon reduction forms the product.

Wait, maybe the product forms via a pinacol rearrangement or something similar, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ether ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester which, upon reduction, forms a diol which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ketone is converted to an alcohol. Then, the ester group undergoes hydrolysis to form a carboxylic acid, which then reacts with the alcohol to form a cyclic ester (lactone).

But the product is a cyclic ketone, not an ester. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, and upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, and the ester remains. Then, the molecule cyclizes to form a ring, incorporating the ester and the alcohol.

Wait, perhaps that's it. So, the reduction of the ketone to an alcohol creates a hydroxyl group that can attack the ester's carbonyl, leading to a ring formation.

In that case, the starting material's configuration would determine the configuration at the new stereocenter in the product.

So, if the starting material is (R) at C3, then after reduction and cyclization, the product's C4 would be (R) or (S), depending on the reaction.

Now, considering the reagents: LiBH4 and BH3. Perhaps LiBH4 is a bulky reducing agent, leading to a certain configuration, while BH3 leads to the opposite.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Maybe when the ketone is reduced, the approach of the hydride is influenced by the configuration of the starting material, leading to different products based on the reagent.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are different. LiBH4 is usually used in aprotic solvents, while BH3 might be used in something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition. For example, the hydride adds to the α,β-unsaturated ketone, leading to a certain stereochemistry.

But the starting material doesn't seem to have an α,β-unsaturated system.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S) configuration.

B) A and B are both (R) configuration.

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

The product from A is (R), and from B is (S).

So, looking for A and B to have opposite configurations, which would make sense if the reaction's stereochemistry is controlled by the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but looking at the options, only options C and D have opposite configurations for A and B.

Option C: A is (S), B is (R).

Option D: A is (R), B is (S).

So, which of these would lead to the correct product configurations?

Now, the question is about the effect of the reducing agents on the product's configuration.

If the reagents (LiBH4 and BH3) cause the product configurations to be opposite, regardless of the starting material, then the starting materials would have to be the same configuration. But that's not the case here because the products are enantiomers.

Alternatively, the reagents might cause the configuration to flip based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 adds the hydride from one face, leading to a certain configuration, while BH3 adds from the opposite face, leading to the opposite configuration.

So, if the starting material is (R), LiBH4 would lead to (R) product, and BH3 would lead to (S), or vice versa.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reducing agents have different reactivities that influence the approach of the hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ketone reduction, and the configuration of the starting material determines the approach of the hydride, leading to the product's configuration.

But I'm not making progress.

Wait, another approach: the product's configuration is opposite when different reducing agents are used. So, if A uses LiBH4 and produces (R), B uses BH3 and produces (S). Therefore, the starting materials must be the same configuration. Because the same starting material, when reduced by different reagents, gives opposite configurations. But that's only possible if the reagents lead to opposite configurations from the same starting material.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, leading to opposite products when reduced with the same reagent. But the question uses different reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents cause the product configuration to be the same as the starting material's configuration for one reagent and opposite for the other.

But I'm not certain.

Without a clear understanding of the mechanism, perhaps I can make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, options C and D have opposite configurations for A and B.

Given that A uses LiBH4 and B uses BH3, and the products are enantiomers.

Assuming that the reagents cause the product's configuration to be the opposite of the starting material's configuration.

If A is (S) and B is (R), then with LiBH4, A becomes (R), and with BH3, B becomes (S). That would fit.

So, the correct option would be C: A is (S), B is (R).

Wait, but I'm not completely confident.

Alternatively, if the reagents cause the same configuration to be retained, then A and B would need to be opposite. But that would lead to the same product configurations.

Hmm.

Wait, if the product's configuration is opposite to the starting material's configuration when using a certain reagent, then A and B would be the same and the products would be opposites. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's configuration is the same as the product's configuration. So, if A is (R), then the product is (R). So, the correct answer would be D: A is (R), B is (S), leading to products (R) and (S).

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about the effect of LiBH4 and BH3 on the configuration of the starting material.

LiBH4 is a hydride donor that typically doesn't have high steric demand. So, it might approach from the less hindered face, leading to a certain configuration. BH3, when used in hydroboration, adds in a way that depends on the structure, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, while BH3 leads to inversion. Or vice versa.

But I'm not certain. 

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is D: A is (R), B is (S), because when each is reduced with their respective reagent, they produce (R) and (S) products.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, option C: A is (S), B is (R), leading to (R) and (S) products.

Without a clear understanding of the exact mechanism, it's tough. But I'll go with option D, where A is (R) and B is (S), because that would mean that each reagent produces the corresponding enantiomer.


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 and BH3. The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can have either (R) or (S) configuration.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Formation**: The product is a cyclic ketone, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, with the ethyl group at position 4. The stereochemistry of the product (R or S) depends on the stereochemistry of the starting material and the reducing agent used.

2. **Role of Reducing Agents**:
   - **LiBH4**: A strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the approach of the hydride ion, which can be influenced by steric and electronic factors.
   - **BH3**: Often used in hydroboration reactions, which follow anti-Markovnikov addition and have specific stereochemical outcomes. However, in this case, BH3 is likely reducing a ketone to an alcohol, with a different stereochemical preference compared to LiBH4.

3. **Stereochemical Relationship**:
   - The starting materials A and B must have opposite configurations to produce enantiomeric products. If A is (R), B must be (S), and vice versa.
   - The reducing agents (LiBH4 and BH3) likely induce opposite stereochemical outcomes from the same starting material, leading to the enantiomeric products.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S). This would not produce enantiomeric products, as both would yield the same configuration.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R). Similarly, this would not produce enantiomeric products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S), B is (R). This configuration allows for the production of enantiomeric products, as the reducing agents would induce opposite stereochemical outcomes.
   - **Option D**: A is (R), B is (S). This is also consistent with the requirement for enantiomeric products.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Options C and D are the only plausible choices, as they involve starting materials with opposite configurations. Based on the reasoning that the reducing agents induce opposite stereochemical outcomes, **Option D** (A = (R), B = (S)) is the most consistent with the formation of the enantiomeric products.
