Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Hmm, wait, filling factor is usually the area of the spots relative to the total surface area they're covering. So if it's 20%, that's 0.2.

The star's effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, right? The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots must be at 5000 K because 6000 - 1000 equals 5000. Cool spots, so they emit less light.

The main point is that when the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective. This causes variations in the brightness we observe, which is similar to the dip in brightness when a planet transits in front of a star (like the transit method for exoplanet detection). But in this case, it's the star's spots that are causing the variation, not a planet. However, the question is asking, if a planet were to cause the same amplitude in the light curve, what would its radius be relative to the star?

So, the problem is comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a planet. The goal is to find R_pl (planet radius) / R_star (host star radius) such that the planet's transit causes the same change in brightness as the spots do.

First, I need to calculate the amplitude (depth) of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude caused by a planet, and solve for R_pl.

Let me think about the brightness variation from the spots. The star's total brightness when the spots are visible changes because some cooler (dimmer) areas are blocking the hotter parts. Since the star is rotating, the spots come into view when the star's rotation brings them into our line of sight.

Wait, but the star's entire surface is emitting, so the overall brightness when spots are visible depends on how much cooler area is blocking the hotter star. 

The formula for the brightness variation (ΔF) would be based on the difference in flux from the star with and without the spots. But when considering rotational modulation, the brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Alternatively, for the purpose of this problem, maybe I can model the total flux change when the spots are facing us versus when they're not. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spots are visible, the total flux from the star decreases because the spots (cooler regions) are now part of the visible surface. The variation in flux is the difference between the star's normal flux and the flux when the spots are blocking part of it.

The star's luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But when part of the star's surface is cooler, the total luminosity is reduced. 

The flux from the star without spots is F0 = σTeff^4. Wait, no, the flux per unit area is σT^4, so the total flux (luminosity) is the area times that flux per unit area. 

Wait, let's do this more carefully. Let me consider the star's total flux as F0 when all its surface is at Teff. When part of it is cooler, the total flux is F0 - ΔF, where ΔF is the flux lost due to the spots.

The spots cover a fraction of the surface. The filling factor is 0.2, but wait, the question says one hemisphere is covered, with a filling factor of 20%. Hmm, so the total area covered by
