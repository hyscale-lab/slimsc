Okay, so I've got this problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy is given in terms of E, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²). 

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so each has spin up or down. But in this context, since they're identical fermions, I guess the Pauli exclusion principle applies. So their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. 

The well is one-dimensional, so each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The energy for a single particle in a 1D infinite well is E_n = (n²) * E, right? Because E is based on n squared. So for a single particle, n=1,2,3,..., E is E, 4E, 9E, etc.

But with four particles, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin. But wait, the particles are in the same potential well, so each will have their own n and spin state.

In a 1D well, each single-particle state is characterized by n (the principal quantum number) and spin. Since spin is 1/2, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles: one spin up, one spin down. Wait, no, wait: no, each particle is spin-1/
