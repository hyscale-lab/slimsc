Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing product 1. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each step does. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that when adamantane derivatives react with KOH, elimination reactions can happen because KOH is a strong base. So, heating with KOH would likely cause an elimination, maybe forming an alkene. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Oh wait, no, 1 and 3 are positions on the adamantane structure. So maybe each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is used in such cases, it can lead to dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond. So, probably, product 1 is 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe it's a transannular elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide? Wait, no, because KOH is a base, not an acid. Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane... when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you'd form a double bond between those carbons. So product 1 would be 1,3-diene, but in an adamantane structure, that might form a bridge. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening or forming an epoxide? Wait, no, KOH isn't an oxidizing agent in this case. Wait, perhaps it's a dielimination to form a diene. So, product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene. But I'm not 100% sure.

Looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Wait a minute, but if product 1 is a diene, where's the carbonyl? That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the initial reaction.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Oh, wait, when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, sometimes they undergo substitution, but that's more for primary alkyl halides. Adamantane is a highly branched, diamondoid structure, so it's more likely to undergo elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening if the structure allows. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide via an elimination but I'm not sure. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl, which suggests maybe an ester or ketone group is formed.

Wait another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could undergo a double elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide formation typically requires a peracid or something like that, not KOH. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction, but in a hindered environment. Alternatively, could it form a diol? No, because that would have OH groups, but the IR doesn't show broad peaks around 3300, which diols usually do. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a carbonyl. Wait, wait, if two Br atoms are adjacent, perhaps an elimination would form a carbonyl group, but that's only possible if the Brs are on adjacent carbons and can form a double bond. Wait, but 1 and 3 on adamantane probably aren't adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four six-membered rings. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. So, if each bridgehead has a Br, then eliminating HBr from each would form a bridge between those carbons, perhaps creating a double bond. Wait, but that would require the two Brs being on adjacent carbons, which I think they are. So, when KOH is added, maybe the two Br atoms leave, taking H+ with them, and forming a double bond. So, the product would have a double bond between C1 and C3 of the adamantane. But how would that look? Alternatively, each Br might leave, but forming a ring? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-type elimination. Wait, but pinacol is vicinal diol elimination, which isn't the case here. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR data of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is maybe a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is probably a lot of equivalent protons in a rigid structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 (2H) might be another methylene group. Oh wait, 4.79 could be an OCH2 group. So, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Wait, but then an epoxide would have two protons adjacent to oxygen, which would be deshielded, so around 3-4 ppm. But if it's an OCH2, perhaps it's an ether.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. So, product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

Hmm. Maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. Wait, KOH could deprotonate something. Alternatively, perhaps the Br atoms are replaced by hydroxide, but that would form a diol, which doesn't fit the IR data. So that's probably not it.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the IR. A peak at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of an ester (C=O stretch around 1720-1740) or maybe a ketone (around 1700-1750). So, product 1 has a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the reaction is an oxidation? But KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Unless there's another factor, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, considering the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a ketone. Because two Brs being eliminated would create a carbonyl group. That makes sense! So, if each Br is on a bridgehead, eliminating two HBr molecules would form a carbonyl. So product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane? Wait, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single elimination forming a ketone.

Wait, but elimination of two HBr would form a double bond, but that doesn't give a carbonyl. Oh wait, wait, elimination of two HBr from adjacent carbons would form a double bond. But how does that lead to a carbonyl group? Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Maybe a substitution where the Br is replaced by an -O- group, forming a cyclic ether. But no, that would give an epoxide, which doesn't have a carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe the KOH is acting as a base for a rearrangement. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH is added, perhaps it undergoes a double elimination (two E2 mechanisms) to form a conjugated diene. But then where is the carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the NMR and IR again. The IR has a strong peak at 1720, so definitely a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH could form a diketone. How? Maybe each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would require substitution, which is less likely with KOH. Alternatively, perhaps the base induces a rearrangement where the Br leaves, and an oxygen takes its place. Wait, but that would require O to substitute Br, which would be more of a substitution reaction, but under basic conditions, maybe it's possible.

Wait, another angle: maybe the product is a ketone. Suppose each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination of HBr leads to formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, but elimination typically forms alkenes, not ketones. Unless it's a special case. Wait, wait, perhaps the structure is such that elimination of two HBr from 1,3 positions leads to formation of a carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe the Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, but in a way that when they eliminate, they form a carbonyl. For example, if the carbon adjacent to each Br has a hydrogen, then elimination would form a double bond. But that doesn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's not elimination. Maybe it's a substitution, but with something else. Wait, what if the Br is replaced with an -O- group? So, for example, each Br is replaced by an -O- group, forming a cyclic ether. But then that would have an oxygen connecting the two bridgehead carbons, making a five-membered ring? Not sure. But that would give an ether, which would have an IR peak around 1100 cm-1, but not at 1720.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think about the NMR shifts. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a methylene group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. 1.94 ppm (2H) could be another methylene group. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) are probably in a rigid structure, perhaps like adamantane.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diol. But the IR doesn't show broad peaks for OH. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but again, the IR doesn't match. So maybe I'm stuck. Let me consider the IR again. 1720 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a gem-dibromide that undergoes some reaction to form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH undergoes a substitution where one Br is replaced by hydroxide, but then what? That would give a bromo-adamantanol, which doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a double substitution, but I don't see how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not substitution but oxidation. But KOH isn't an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the base induces an elimination to form a carbonyl. Oh! Wait, maybe it's a keto-enol tautomerism? I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates something, leading to a carbonyl formation.

Wait, another approach: let's think about product 1. The IR shows a carbonyl. The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. If that's an OCH2 group, perhaps it's an ester or an ether. Wait, but 4.79 could also be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone. The 4.79 could be something else, like an ethylene group adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, but then why would there be a 2H at 4.79?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a carbonyl and an adjacent OCH2 group. Maybe a cyclic ester or something else.

Wait, this is getting me nowhere. Let's think about the next step. Product 1 is treated with excess Al isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid. It's often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. So, product 2 is likely an acylated or alkylated version of product 1.

So, if product 1 has a carbonyl group, Al isopropoxide could help in the acylation of an aromatic ring. But wait, adamantane doesn't have an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diol or something else. Or maybe product 1 undergoes some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, if product 1 is a diol, then treating with Al isopropoxide might lead to some kind of acetylation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and reacting with Al isopropoxide could form some kind of enol ether or something else. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diketone. Then, when treated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of cyclization. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide, and Al isopropoxide could help in opening it. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diethyl ether derivative, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making progress on the first two steps. Let's move to product 3, which is the result of ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis of alkenes typically cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. The most deshielded hydrogen is typically near an electronegative atom or in an environment that deshields it, like near a carbonyl group.

So, if product 3 has carbonyl groups, the nearby hydrogens would be deshielded. The coupling pattern depends on the neighboring hydrogens.

Suppose product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So, the structure of product 2 must be an alkene.

Wait, but product 2 is formed from product 1 treated with Al isopropoxide. So product 1 must have had a structure that, when treated with a Lewis acid, forms an alkene.

Wait, another possibility: product 1 is a diol, and with Al isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes some kind of elimination to form an alkene. That would make product 2 an alkene, which when ozonolyzed would give diols or carbonyl compounds.

Hmm, let me think again. Product 1 has a carbonyl group, as per the IR. So, product 1 is a carbonyl-containing compound. When treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, maybe it acts as a catalyst for some kind of elimination, forming an alkene. So product 2 would be an alkene.

Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. The resulting product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were.

So, let's imagine product 2 is an alkene, perhaps a transannular alkene in the adamantane structure. Ozonolysis would break this into two carbonyl groups, perhaps ketones or aldehydes.

Once product 3 is formed, the 1H NMR would show the hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups. These are usually deshielded and appear downfield.

Now, the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So, in the product 3, the hydrogens next to the carbonyl groups would be these deshielded hydrogens.

In ozonolysis, each double bond is cleaved, and the number of carbons on each side determines the structure. Suppose the alkene in product 2 is between two sets of carbons. Each carbonyl in product 3 would have adjacent hydrogens.

Assuming the alkene was symmetrical, product 3 would have identical environments on each side. So, each carbonyl would have a CH2 group next to it, each with two hydrogens.

Wait, but the coupling pattern depends on neighboring protons. For example, if a hydrogen is next to another hydrogen, it would split into a doublet. If it's next to two sets of Hs, it could be more complex.

Wait, let's say the carbonyl is at the end of a chain. For example, if product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 group next to the carbonyl would have two Hs. Each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2, but that's just a thought.

Alternatively, if product 3 has a structure where each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, and those CH2 groups are next to each other, then the Hs on each CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs from the neighboring CH2. So, each H would be a triplet.

Wait, but in ozonolysis, the number of carbons on each side of the double bond determines the structure. For example, if the alkene was between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would form two aldehyde groups.

Wait, sorry, perhaps a better approach would be to consider the possible structure after ozonolysis.

Let me try to reconstruct the steps:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane â product 1 (with carbonyl) upon heating with KOH.

2. Product 1 â product 2 upon heating with Al isopropoxide. Since Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, perhaps it induces an elimination to form an alkene.

3. Product 2 is ozonolyzed to form product 3, which has carbonyl groups.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were in product 2.

Now, considering product 3's NMR. The most deshielded H would be adjacent to the carbonyl. Let's say each carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group. Then, the Hs on those CH2 would be deshielded.

Each of those Hs would be next to two Hs on the same CH2. So, each H would couple with two others, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but in reality, each H on a CH2 would have neighboring Hs on adjacent groups. Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to another CH2 group.

But wait, if the ozonolysis breaks the double bond into two carbonyls, each attached to a CH2 group, then each CH2 would be adjacent to the carbonyl and possibly another CH2 group.

If it's like O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO, then each CH2 group is between two carbonyl groups. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain. Or maybe it's a ring structure.

Wait, but in the case of ozonolysis of a simple alkene like CH2=CH2, you'd get two formaldehyde molecules. But in a more complex structure, it would cleave into two carbonyl compounds.

Alternatively, if product 2 is an exocyclic double bond, ozonolysis would break it into a ketone and an aldehyde or two ketones, depending on the structure.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the coupling pattern.

The most deshielded H is likely to be on a CH2 next to a carbonyl. Each H on that CH2 would see two neighboring Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps one or more on adjacent groups.

Wait, in the case of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, the Hs on that CH2 are adjacent to each other (two Hs) and possibly to another CH2 group. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C=O, then each CH2 is next to another CH2.

So, each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, but wait, that's for two neighboring groups each with two Hs. Or is it more?

Wait, let's think about a CH2 group in the middle of a chain. Each H on the CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (giving a triplet) and by the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group (another triplet). So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which would be a 9-line splitting, but that's not common. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are similar, leading to a more simplified pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are next to one H on one side and two on the other. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each CH2 is only adjacent to one other H. No, that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is part of a larger system, like a ring. For example, if the product 3 is a cyclic diketone, then each CH2 would be between two carbonyls. Each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 and perhaps one H from an adjacent CH2 in the ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: if the CH2 is attached to a carbonyl and is adjacent to another CH2 which is attached to another carbonyl, then each H on the first CH2 would be next to two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the splitting would be (n+1) for each neighboring group. So, each H would be split by two groups: their own CH2 (giving a triplet) and the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but that's a lot of lines. Alternatively, perhaps the coupling constants are different, leading to a more complex pattern.

But looking at the options, the possible answers are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

If the H is split by two neighboring groups, each giving a triplet, then the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets (each triplet has three lines, and each line is further split into three, leading to 3x3=9 lines). But that's a lot, and I haven't heard of such a pattern being common.

Alternatively, maybe the H is next to two Hs on one side and one H on the other. For example, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHO, then the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be adjacent to two Hs on their own CH2 and one H on the CH(CH3) group. But that would lead to a triplet and a doublet, resulting in a triplet of doublets, which isn't one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is next to two Hs on one side and another two Hs on another side, but maybe the coupling constants are similar, leading to a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about the possible structures again.

If product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 after ozonolysis would have carbonyl groups where the double bonds were. Suppose product 2 is an exocyclic alkene, perhaps with one end as a CH2 and the other end as a bridge. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups, each attached to a CH2.

So, the structure would be something like O=C-CH2-CH2-O=C-. But that's just a four-membered ring, perhaps. Wait, no, that's not possible. Maybe it's a chain.

Alternatively, think about ozonolysis of a cyclopropane? No, that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is an adamantane with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups on adjacent carbons. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups adjacent to each other, maybe as (CH2) groups next to each ketone.

So, the structure would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO. Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain with two ketones at each end. Then, the CH2 groups in the middle would each have two Hs, which are adjacent to each other and to the ketone groups.

Each H on the central CH2 would be next to two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and perhaps another set of Hs from adjacent CH2 groups. But if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 is between two carbonyls, so each CH2 is next to another CH2 on either side. So each H on the central CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same CH2 and two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

Wait, but in that structure, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. So, each H on CH2 would be split by the two Hs on the same CH2 (triplet) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (another triplet). So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are only coupled to the Hs on the same CH2 and not the adjacent ones because of symmetry or because the adjacent groups are equivalent. Hmm, that could change the coupling pattern.

Wait, if the two CH2 groups are identical (due to symmetry), then each H would only see the two Hs on their own CH2, making it a triplet. But if the two CH2 groups are adjacent and different, then each H would see the two Hs on their own CH2 and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the Hs are only coupled to the adjacent CH2 group, but that would still lead to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 group is only adjacent to one other H. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, the correct answer is likely a triplet or a triplet of triplets.

If the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then each CH2 group's Hs are adjacent to two Hs on their own group and two Hs on the other CH2. So each H would be split by two couplings: one with J1 and another with J2. If J1 and J2 are similar, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, but that's a lot of lines. Alternatively, if J1 and J2 are very different, the splitting might not be as complex, but I'm not sure.

But the options are limited, so perhaps the correct answer is a triplet.

Wait, another thought: maybe the Hs are in a geminal position (same carbon) but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are on a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl and another CH group, leading to a different coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 is next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, each CH2's Hs would be adjacent to two Hs on their own CH2 and two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So same as before, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not 100% certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs are only next to one other H, making a doublet. But that doesn't fit with the IR data.

Wait, maybe the most deshielded H is a methine (CH) group. If it's a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl, then it would be split by the two Hs on the same CH and perhaps another H on an adjacent group.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is between two sets of Hs with different J values, leading to a doublet of triplets or something else.

Wait, I'm going around in circles. Let me think about the options. The options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the H is coupled to two sets of two Hs each, with similar J values, it would be a triplet of triplets (option B). If the J values are different, perhaps it's a doublet of triplets (option C). Alternatively, perhaps it's only coupled to one H (leading to a doublet) or three Hs (a quartet), but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is between two carbonyls, and each H on the CH2 is split by the two Hs on the same CH2 and one H on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Hmm. I'm still not entirely sure, but given the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, option B.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step and the reasoning leading to the answer:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH likely results in a double elimination of HBr, forming a carbonyl-containing compound. The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cmâ»Â¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group (C=O). The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen) and a rigid adamantane-like structure.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   Aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, likely induces an elimination reaction in product 1, forming an alkene (product 2). This step introduces a double bond into the structure.

3. **Ozonolysis of product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming carbonyl-containing compounds (product 3). The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is on a CHâ group adjacent to a carbonyl. This hydrogen is coupled to two hydrogens on the same CHâ group (giving a triplet) and two hydrogens on the adjacent CHâ group (another triplet). The overall coupling pattern is a **triplet of triplets**.

Critical analysis of the options:  
- **A) Triplet**: This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled only to two equivalent hydrogens on the same CHâ group, which is insufficient given the structure.  
- **B) Triplet of triplets**: This matches the scenario where the hydrogen is coupled to two hydrogens on the same CHâ group and two hydrogens on the adjacent CHâ group.  
- **C) Doublet of triplets**: This would occur if the hydrogen were coupled to one hydrogen and two equivalent hydrogens, which is not consistent with the structure.  
- **D) Pentet**: This would require coupling to four equivalent hydrogens, which is not possible in this case.

The most consistent coupling pattern for the most deshielded hydrogen is **triplet of triplets**.

ANSWER: B
