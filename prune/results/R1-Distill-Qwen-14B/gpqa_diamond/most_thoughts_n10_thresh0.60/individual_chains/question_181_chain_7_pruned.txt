Okay, I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio question. Let's see. So the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. And we need to find the ratio of the fluxes between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

Hmm, I remember that the Sun produces neutrinos mainly through the proton-proton chain. There are different branches, like the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III, each producing neutrinos at different energies. Oh wait, right, the main one is the pp-I branch which produces a lot of neutrinos, but the pp-III branch does something else.

Wait, the pp-III branch is supposed to produce higher energy neutrinos. Because the pp-I branch is the dominant one, but pp-III is a minor branch. So when the pp-III stops, what happens to the neutrino flux in different energy ranges?

So the flux from pp-III would be gone. But how does this affect the two bands?

Band 1 is 700-800 keV. Band 2 is 800-900 keV. Let me think about which neutrino energies come from where.

I think the pp-I branch produces neutrinos around 250 keV, like the main neutrinos from the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch might produce higher energy neutrinos, maybe around 700-800 keV or higher. Wait, wait, I need to remember the details.

Wait, I think the main neutrinos are from the pp-I branch at around 250 keV. The pp-III branch is less dominant and might produce higher energy neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in higher energy regions would decrease.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of two specific bands. So band 1 is 700-800, band 2 is 800-900. If the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in these higher bands, stopping it would reduce the flux in those bands.

But I'm not sure exactly which branch contributes where. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch produces more of the higher energy neutrinos. So if it stops, then the flux in the higher bands would drop
