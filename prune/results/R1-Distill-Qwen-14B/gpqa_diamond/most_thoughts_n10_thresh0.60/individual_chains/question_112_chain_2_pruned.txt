Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's an electron in a state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator.

Hmm, the operator in question has a matrix representation where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Wait, so if it's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (since up and down are spin states), then the matrix would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
      [hbar/2, 0] ]

Right, because for i â‰  j, Aij is hbar/2, and diagonal elements (i=j) are zero.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait, no, the problem says Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, else zero. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So yeah, the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, but then what are the eigenstates of this operator? Because the probability of
