Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me think. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds based on their NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14, so both compounds must fit that. The mixture is 1:1, and the NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. And then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, let me break this down. So the aromatic region shows two singlets, each integrating for one proton each, because the ratio is 1:1. That suggests each aromatic compound has one set of equivalent protons. Because when you mix two compounds, each with their own aromatic protons, each would show as a separate signal. So each of these compounds must have a single type of aromatic proton.

Looking at the options, each is a tetramethylbenzene except option C, which is diethyl. Let me list the structures:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So that's a benzene ring with methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, but that's adjacent, so maybe it's 1,2,3,4 positions. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more symmetrical arrangement. Wait, wait, 1,2,3,4 would mean four methyl groups at four adjacent positions. Wait, no, that's four in a row, which probably isn't possible because benzene is a six-membered ring. Oh wait, no, 1,2,3,4 would be four positions in a row, so that's not correct. Wait, maybe it's 1,2,3,4 as in four positions in a square? No, benzene is a ring, so 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions, but that doesn't make complete sense. Wait, perhaps it's a typo. Wait, but the question says 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which would have four methyl groups at positions 1,2,3,4. So that would leave positions 5 and 6 empty. Wait, but that doesn't seem symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more symmetric structure. Let me think about the substituents.

Wait, another approach: for
