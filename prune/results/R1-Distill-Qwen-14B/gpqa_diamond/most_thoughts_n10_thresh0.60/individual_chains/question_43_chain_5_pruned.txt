Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I need to visualize the benzene ring. The question says there's a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. Hmm, meta means each is separated by one carbon. So if the carboxylic acid is on carbon 1, the other two (carbaldehyde and cyano) would be on 3 and 5, but wait, wait, wait. No, because if they are meta to each other, each is two positions apart. Let me maybe draw this out mentally.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with positions 1 to 6. The substituents are all meta. So if I number the ring, the carboxylic acid (let's call that COOH) is at position 1. Then, the other two substituents (formyl, CHO, and cyano, CN) should be at positions 3 and 5, but wait, that can't be because three substituents can't all be meta. Oh wait, perhaps I got that wrong. The question says all three are meta to one another. So each substituent is meta to the other two. That's only possible if they are on positions 1, 3, and 5 of the ring. So that's every other position, each separated by two carbons. So, that makes sense.

But wait, let me think again. The question says "meta to one another." So each substituent is meta to the others. So for three substituents, they must each be at positions 1,3,5. Because each is two carbons apart from the others.

So, the carboxylic acid is in position 1, formyl in 3, cyano in 5. Or any other permutation, because the substituents could be in any of those positions. But I need to figure out where each group is based on the other details.

The next part of the question: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh wait, carboxylic acid is at position 1. Ortho positions are 2 and 6. So positions 2 and 6 have
