Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, the question involves some concepts I remember from my studies, but I'm a bit rusty, so I need to take it slow.

Alright, the question states that we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. The final NN state has T=0, and we need to determine which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each with different transitions.

First, let me parse the information. The initial state is 1S0. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 would be S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), orbital angular momentum L=0 (since it's S, which is spherically symmetric), and J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is NN plus X. The problem is about the conservation laws—specifically angular momentum and parity. Also, Pauli's exclusion principle is involved, which relates to the quantum numbers via the equation T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, let me get the Pauli condition right. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So the isospin T is related to the spin S and orbital angular momentum L of the NN. So if T is 0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which means S + L must be 1 mod 2, because 0-1 = -1 ≡ 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

So, the final NN state must have S + L odd. Let me note that down.

Now, the system emits a particle X. So the initial state is 1S0 (S=0, L=0, J=0). The process is initial state → final state (NN) + X. So the initial total angular momentum and parity must equal the sum of the final state's.

But since X is emitted, it's a decay process. So the initial state's angular momentum is the same as the sum of the final state's angular momenta. The same goes for parity.

Wait, the initial state has J=0, so the sum of the angular momenta of the NN and X must be zero. So, we're considering the decay 1S0 → (NN in some state) + X. Let's think in terms of angular momentum conservation.

Also, the parity of the initial state must equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X. Because parity is multiplicative under tensor products.

The initial parity is the parity of the 1S0 state. For a state with L=0, the parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. So parity is +1.

The parity of the final state is parity of NN multiplied by parity of X. The parity of X is given as -1. So, parity of NN * (-1) must equal +1 (initial parity). Therefore, the parity of the NN state must be -1, because (-1) * (-1) = 1.

Wait, let me compute that. Initial parity is +1. Final parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X). So +1 = (parity NN) * (-1). Therefore, parity NN = (-1) * (+1) = -1. So the NN state in the final state must have parity -1.

But the parity of the NN state is determined by its L quantum number. The parity is (-1)^L. So, (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd, because (-1)^odd = -1.

So L (for the NN state) must be odd.

Additionally, from the Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2. The NN state has T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L must equal 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

We already have that L is odd, because parity of NN is -1. So L is odd, so S + L is S + odd. But since S + L must be odd, that implies S must be even. Because odd (L) + even (S) = odd. Alternatively, if S were odd, L is odd, sum would be even. So S must be even.

So for the NN state, S is even, and L is odd.

So, in the final state, the NN must have even S and odd L.

Now, considering the decay, the initial state is J=0. The NN and X have their own angular momenta, and their vector sum must be zero. So the total angular momentum J_total = J_NN + J_X must be zero.

But J_X is the angular momentum of X. Let's think about each option.

Each option gives the transition as 1S0 → something + X, where X is p, s, d, f, etc. So the possible X particles are p (l=1), s (l=0), d (l=2), f (l=3), etc.

Wait, but the options list the angular momentum state of X as lowercase letters: p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3.

But wait, in the options, the transitions are given as:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p: So X is a p (l=1)
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p: X is p (l=1)
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f: X is f (l=3)
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s: X is s (l=0)

Wait, but wait: each option is labeled as 1S0 → ... + something.

No, wait, the description of the problem says that the options are like 1S0 -> 7D1 + p. So the first part is the initial state, then the final NN state, then the emitted particle.

Wait, no, the question says "the final NN state has T=0" and the initial state is 1S0 which is a NN state. So the initial state is NN in 1S0, which emits X, becoming another NN state (let's say state F) plus X. So, the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN in F plus X.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. The final state is F (NN) with some S, L, and J, plus X with angular momentum l (from X's state, like p is l=1, etc.).

So, for each option, the F state is given as, e.g., 7D1. Let me parse that.

The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for F = 7D1: 7 implies 2S+1=7 → S=3. L is D → L=2. J=1.

Wait, but J is the total angular momentum, which is the sum of S and L. But in reality, J can take values |S-L| to S+L in integer steps. So for S=3 and L=2, possible J are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So J=1 is allowed.

But in the problem, the F state has T=0. For NN, isospin T is determined by whether they are in a singlet or triplet state. But I'm not sure about that. Wait, in the Pauli condition, T(NN) is the isospin of the NN state. For two nucleons (protons and neutrons), the isospin depends on their combination. But if the NN state is in a singlet state (T=0), that's for spin 0, but wait, isospin is separate from spin. Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of isospin addition.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to the problem.

Each option gives the F state as, say, 3S1. So, for F = 3S1: 3 is 2S+1 → S=1. L is S, so L=0. J=1. But wait, if L=0 and S=1, J can only be 1. That's okay.

So, for each option, let's note the F's S, L, and J.

But perhaps I should think about the angular momentum conservation. The initial J is 0, so the total J of the final state (F + X) must be 0. So, J_F (NN) + J_X (X) must be 0. But since angular momentum is a vector, their sum must be zero. So, the magnitudes and directions must cancel.

Wait, but J is a vector, so their vector sum must be zero. So, the possible cases are when J_F = J_X and their directions are opposite. But in the options, the emitted X's states are given as p (l=1), s (l=0), d (l=2), f (l=3). So, the orbital angular momentum of X would be l=1, etc. But maybe X can have spin, but I think we're talking about orbital angular momentum here. Hmm, but perhaps the spin is considered as part of the angular momentum. Wait, no, in particle physics, the spin is a separate from orbital angular momentum, but in the context of decay, the total angular momentum comes into play.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. The sum of the angular momenta of F and X must result in J=0. So, for each option, F has a certain J and X has a certain l (which is its orbital angular momentum, but maybe its total angular momentum? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.)

Alternatively, perhaps when X is emitted, its angular momentum state is part of the process, and we have to ensure that the initial angular momentum (J=0) is conserved. So, the angular momentum of the NN state (F) plus that of X must add to J=0.

Wait, but J of the NN state is given in the options, and the X is a particle with its own angular momentum. So let's see.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which has J=0. The final state is (F) J_F + X's J_X, and their vector sum must be zero.

So, J_F and J_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. So, J_F = J_X, but opposite in direction. But since we're dealing with quantum numbers, perhaps the only possibility is that J_F equals J_X, but opposite. But in quantum terms, the only way their vector sum can be zero is if J_F and J_X are the same magnitude and opposite directions. But since these are quantum numbers, perhaps we can only have a situation where J_F = J_X, and in that case, the only possible way for the sum to be zero is if J_F = J_X = 0. But wait, that's not possible in all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps we should consider the possible values for J_F and J_X such that their sum can be zero. So if J_F is m and J_X is n, their sum can be zero only if m = n and their directions are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, the only way this can happen is if J_F = J_X and they are in opposite directions. But how does that translate into the possible options?

Wait, perhaps for each option, we can compute the possible J_F and J_X and see if their sum can be zero.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total angular momentum must be conserved. The initial J is 0, so the sum of the final J's (vector sum) must be zero. So, the possible J's for F and X must be such that their sum can result in zero. So, for each option, we can compute the possible J of F and X.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the possible J values. The initial J is 0. So F's J and X's J must be such that their vector sum is zero. So, J_F and J_X must have the same magnitude and opposite direction. But in quantum mechanics, this can only happen if J_F = J_X and they are aligned oppositely, but the total must be zero.

Wait, but the only way their vector sum is zero is if J_F = J_X, and they are in opposite directions. But in terms of quantum numbers, the only possibility is if J_F = J_X and their sum can be zero. But this is possible only if J_F = J_X, but how?

Wait, perhaps the only way for their vector sum to be zero is if J_F = J_X, but that's not possible unless both are zero. Because otherwise, the vectors would add up to something non-zero. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that the initial state has J=0, so the sum of the final J's (J_F and J_X) must be zero. So, J_F and J_X must form a zero vector when added. The only way this can happen is if J_F = J_X and they are opposite. But considering the possible J values, the only way is if J_F = J_X and their sum is zero. But that's only possible if both are zero, which is unlikely except for s-waves.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the possible angular momentum states. For the initial state to have J=0, the final state must have NN and X with total J=0.

So, for each option, let's look at the F and X.

Each option gives F as a certain state and X as another. Let's take each option one by one.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

F is 7D1 (S=3, L=2, J=1). X is p (l=1). So X's J would be l=1, but wait, the total angular momentum of X includes its spin as well. But perhaps in this problem, X is treated as a spin-0 particle? Or wait, no—if X is a p (proton), but wait, X is a boson or a fermion? Wait, the problem says X is a particle, but its intrinsic parity is -1, but that's about it. Wait, but in the question, the particle X is emitted, so perhaps its spin is considered in the decay.

Alternatively, perhaps the decay involves the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X. So perhaps the orbital angular momentum L of the decay process is the same as the orbital angular momentum of X.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

Each option gives the final NN state as something like 7D1. For each of these, let's compute S, L, and J.

Option A: F =7D1.

2S+1=7 ⇒ S=3. L=D ⇒ L=2. J=1.

From the Pauli condition: T = S + L +1 mod 2. T=0, so 0 = 3 + 2 +1 mod2 → 3+2+1=6 → 0 mod2. So 0=0. That works. So T=0 is allowed.

Now, the parity of F is (-1)^L = (-1)^2=1. But earlier, we determined that the parity of F must be -1. So this would be a problem. Because the parity of F is 1, but we need it to be -1. So this option would have parity +1.

Wait, but wait, the parity of the F state is (-1)^L. So if L=2, parity is (+1). But earlier, we determined that the parity of NN must be -1. So this would violate parity conservation. Because initial parity is +1, and final parity (NN) is +1, so 1 * (-1) [parity of X] = -1, which doesn't match initial parity of +1.

Wait, no, let me clarify. The initial parity is +1. The final state is NN (parity P_NN) and X (parity P_X = -1). So P_initial = P_NN * P_X.

So +1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1. So F's parity must be -1. So for F, (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd. So in option A, F has L=2 (even), which gives P=+1. So this would violate the parity condition. So option A cannot happen because parity isn't conserved. But wait, the initial parity is +1. The final parity is F's parity * X's parity. So F's parity must be -1 to get (+1) = (-1) * (-1) = +1. So F's parity is -1 → L must be odd.

So for F, L must be odd. So any option where F has even L is invalid.

Looking at the options:

Option A: F has L=2 (even). So parity of F is +1. Which would make the total parity +1 * (-1) = -1, which is not equal to initial parity +1. So this option is invalid. So option A is not allowed.

Option B: F is 3S1.

So L is S → L=0 (S here is the symbol for L=0). So F's parity is (-1)^0 = +1. Which again would require X's parity to be +1 to make initial parity +1. But X's parity is -1, so this would give +1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial +1. So this would also violate parity. So option B is invalid.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. The initial parity is +1. The final parity is (parity of F) * (parity of X) = P_F * (-1) = +1. So P_F must be -1. Thus, F must have parity -1, which requires L being odd. So in option B, F has L=0 → even → parity +1. So this would make the final parity (+1)*(-1)= -1, which doesn't match initial +1 → so parity is violated. So option B is invalid.

Option C: F is 3D3.

3D3 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L=D → L=2. J=3.

From Pauli condition: T= S + L +1 mod2 → 0 = 1 + 2 +1 → 4 mod2 → 0. So condition holds.

Parity of F: (-1)^2 = +1. Again, which would mean the final parity is (+1)*(-1) = -1 → not equal to initial +1. So this violates parity. So option C is invalid.

Wait, but wait, no: L=2 is even, so parity is +1. So F's parity is +1. So total parity is (+1)*(-1) = -1, which doesn't match initial +1. So option C is invalid.

Option D: F is 3P0.

3P0 → 2S+1=3 → S=1. L=P → L=1. J=0.

Pauli condition: T= S + L +1 → 0 = 1 + 1 +1 → 3 → 1 mod2. So 0 ≡ 1 mod2 → which is not correct. So the condition is not satisfied.

Wait, but wait, T must be 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod2. So S + L must be 1 mod2. Here, S=1, L=1 → sum is 2 → 0 mod2. So 0 = 0 +1 → 1 mod2. So 0 ≡1 mod2 → which is false. So condition is not met. So option D would violate the Pauli exclusion condition.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2. So 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L must be 1 mod2. Here, S=1, L=1. S+L=2 → 0 mod2. So 1 mod2 ≠0 mod2 → condition not met. So option D's F state would have T=1, not 0, which is not allowed, as the problem states that T=0.

Wait, but I thought the final state has T=0. So option D's F state would have T=1, but the problem says T=0. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that F's parity must be -1. Let me check this again.

Wait, initial parity is +1. X's parity is -1. So F's parity must be -1. So F's L must be odd, so parity is (-1)^L = -1 → L is odd.

So let me check which options have F with L odd.

Option A: F has L=2 (even) → invalid.

Option B: F has L=0 (even) → invalid.

Option C: F has L=2 (even) → invalid.

Option D: F has L=1 (odd) → valid.

So only option D has F with L=1, which is odd, so F's parity is -1. Thus, the parity is conserved: (-1) * (-1) = +1.

But then, in option D, the Pauli condition isn't met, as S=1 and L=1 → sum is 2 → even (0 mod2). So the condition 0 = (1 +1 +1) mod2 → 3 mod2=1 → 0≠1. So condition not met. So T would be 1, but the problem states T=0.

Wait, but the Pauli condition says T = S + L +1 mod2. So if T=0, 0 = (S + L +1) mod2 → S + L must be 1 mod2.

In option D, S=1, L=1 → sum is 2 → 0 mod2. So 0 +1=1 mod2 → 0 = 1 → which is not correct. So T would be 1, which is not allowed.

So the only option where parity is conserved (L is odd) is option D, but the Pauli condition isn't met. So that's a problem.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in Pauli condition. Let me think again. The condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So for T=0, S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd.

In option D, S=1, L=1 → sum is 2 → even. So S+L is even → S+L+1 is odd → T would be 1. Which is not allowed because the problem states T=0.

So option D violates the Pauli condition, but satisfies parity.

Wait, but the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So any option that doesn't meet T=0 is invalid.

So, among the four options, which ones satisfy both parity conservation and the Pauli condition.

Looking back:

Option A: F has L=2 → even → parity +1 → which doesn't match. So invalid.

Option B: F has L=0 → even → parity +1 → invalid.

Option C: F has L=2 → even → parity +1 → invalid.

Option D: F has L=1 → parity -1 → correct. But S=1, L=1 → S+L=2 → even. So S+L+1=3 → odd. Thus, T would be 1 → which doesn't match T=0. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but that leaves none of the options as valid. But the question states that the final state has T=0, so one of the options must be allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition.

Wait, let me re-express the condition. The equation is T(NN) = S + L + 1 mod2. So if T=0, then 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L = 1 mod2.

So S + L must be odd.

So, for the F state, S and L must be such that their sum is odd.

So, in each option:

Option A: F has S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → odd → condition met. But L=2 → even → parity +1 → which violates the parity condition. So option A is invalid.

Option B: F has S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → odd → condition met. But L=0 → parity +1 → violates parity. So B invalid.

Option C: F has S=1, L=2 → 1+2=3 → odd → condition met. But L=2 → parity +1 → invalid.

Option D: F has S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → even → condition not met. So T would be 1, but the problem says T=0 → invalid.

Wait, so none of the options meet both conditions. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the Pauli condition.

Wait, perhaps the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. Wait, perhaps it's T = S + L +1 mod2, but if that equals zero, then T=0.

Wait, no, the condition is that the sum S + L +1 must be even because T is 0.

So, S + L +1 must be even → S + L must be odd.

So, the options:

A) S=3, L=2 → sum 5 → odd → condition met. But L even → parity +1 → invalid.

B) S=1, L=0 → sum 1 → odd → condition met. But L even → parity +1 → invalid.

C) S=1, L=2 → sum 3 → odd → condition met. L even → parity +1 → invalid.

D) S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → even → condition not met (needs sum odd) → T=1 → invalid.

So all options have either parity violation or Pauli violation. That can't be right. So perhaps I made an error in the parity condition.

Wait, perhaps the parity of X is -1, so the parity of F must be -1 as well, because initial parity is +1. So F's parity is (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd.

Which would mean F has L=1,3,5, etc. So looking at the options, only option D has L=1 (P state).

So in that case, option D is the only one that satisfies parity.

But in option D, the Pauli condition is not met. So perhaps the problem is that I'm incorrectly calculating the Pauli condition.

Wait, the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S + L +1 mod2.

In option D, F has S=1, L=1 → sum is 2 → even. So T would be (1 +1 +1) mod2 → 3 mod2 =1. So T=1, but the problem states T=0. So option D is invalid.

Hmm, but that leaves all options as invalid, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the Pauli condition is T = S + L +1 mod2. So for T=0, S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd.

So, in option D, S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → even. So condition not met. So T would be 1. So option D is invalid.

Wait, but let's look back at the problem statement. It says that the Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod2). So, the equation is T = S + L + 1 mod2.

So for T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L = 1 mod2.

In which case, S + L must be odd.

So among the options, only options A, B, C have S + L odd.

Wait, let me check each option again.

Option A: F has S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → odd. So condition met. But L even → parity +1 → invalid.

Option B: F has S=1, L=0 → sum 1 → odd. Condition met. But L even → parity +1 → invalid.

Option C: F has S=1, L=2 → sum 3 → odd. Condition met. L even → parity +1 → invalid.

Option D: F has S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → even → condition not met. So T=1 → invalid.

So, only options A, B, C meet the Pauli condition, but they all have L even, which violates parity.

Wait, but that can't be. The problem must have an option that is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the parity of the final state.

Wait, the parity of the final state is P_NN * P_X.

P_initial = +1.

So +1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So F must have P_F = -1 ⇒ L odd.

So only option D meets this.

But in option D, the Pauli condition isn't met. So D doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

So, the only possible conclusion is that option D is the only one that satisfies parity, but not Pauli condition. So, it's invalid. But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So which option violates either parity or the Pauli condition.

Wait, but the question says "which of the following partial waves is not permitted." So, the forbidden option would be the one that violates either parity or the Pauli condition.

In this case, all options except D violate parity. So they are invalid. D violates the Pauli condition, but satisfies parity.

But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the forbidden option is one that either violates parity or Pauli.

So, the partial wave refers to the orbital angular momentum of X.

Wait, the options list the emitted X as p, s, d, etc. So the partial wave is the orbital angular momentum state of X.

Wait, but in the decay, the orbital angular momentum between the NN and X is the same as the orbital angular momentum state of X. So the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the decay process.

Wait, but in the problem, X is emitted, so the orbital angular momentum involved in the decay is the same as X's angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the orbital angular momentum of the decay process. The orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum in the decay. So, the orbital angular momentum l of X is given by the lowercase letter in the option.

So, the orbital angular momentum of X is l, which is the same as the orbital angular momentum in the decay process.

Conservation of angular momentum would require that the initial J (0) is equal to the sum of the angular momenta of the final states. So, the F state's J and X's l must combine to give J=0.

Wait, but in reality, the orbital angular momentum is part of the decay process, and the total angular momentum is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps for the decay to be possible, the orbital angular momentum l of X must have the same parity as the initial and final states.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the parity of the initial state is +1. The parity of the final state is P_F * P_X. So F's parity is (-1)^L, and X's parity is (-1)^{l} * intrinsic parity. Wait, no—the intrinsic parity is given as -1 for X. So the total parity of X is (-1)^l * (-1).

Wait, that might complicate things, but perhaps it's better to think that the parity of X is given as -1, which includes its orbital and spin contributions. Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the parity of a particle is a combination of its orbital angular momentum and spin. But for this problem, perhaps X's parity is given as -1, regardless of its orbital state.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's instead consider each option's X's orbital angular momentum and see if angular momentum can be conserved.

The initial J is 0. So, the final state's angular momentum (F's J and X's l) must combine to 0. So, the sum of J_F and l_X (vectorially) must be zero. So, J_F must be equal in magnitude to l_X, and opposite in direction.

But since J_F and l_X are quantum numbers, the only way this can happen is if J_F = l_X and they are oppositely aligned. But since J and l are quantized, this is only possible if J_F = l_X, and their sum can be zero.

Wait, but J_F is the total angular momentum of the F state, which is a combination of its spin and orbital angular momentum. So F's J is determined by the combination of its spin S and orbital L.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the angular momentum coupling. The initial state has J=0, so the final state must have J=0. So, the sum of F's J and X's l must be zero. So, F's J must be equal to X's l, and in opposite directions. But in quantum mechanics, this can happen only if F's J equals X's l, and they are in a state where their sum is zero.

But considering the possible options, for each X's l, we can check if F's J can equal l, and that their sum can be zero.

Let's analyze each option:

Option A: X is p → l=1.

F's J is 1.

So, can F's J=1 and X's l=1 combine to J=0? Yes, if they are in opposite directions. So, possible.

But earlier, the parity condition isn't met, so this option is invalid.

Option B: X is p → l=1.

F's J is 1.

Same as A. But parity condition not met.

Option C: X is f → l=3.

F's J is3.

So, can J_F=3 and l=3 combine to J=0? Yes, if their directions are opposite. So, possible.

But parity condition not met.

Option D: X is s → l=0.

F's J is 0.

So, J_F=0 and X's l=0 → sum is 0. Possible.

But Pauli condition not met.

So, all options except D have parity issues, and D has Pauli condition issues.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So, the forbidden option would be the one that either violates parity or the Pauli condition.

Looking back, the problem states that the final state has T=0. So, only option D has F with L=1 (parity -1) but violates the Pauli condition.

So, the other options have F with L even (parity +1), which violates parity. So, they are not allowed.

Wait, but the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So, the X's orbital angular momentum (l) in the forbidden option is what's being asked.

The options are:

A) X is p (l=1)

B) X is p (l=1)

C) X is f (l=3)

D) X is s (l=0)

Wait, but if all options except D have parity violation, then their partial waves are forbidden. But the question is which is not permitted.

Wait, but the problem states that the final state has T=0. So, only option D has F with L=1 → parity -1. But in option D, the Pauli condition is not met, so T would be 1. So, the F state in D has T=1, which is not allowed. So, option D is invalid.

Thus, the only option that meets both parity and Pauli conditions is none. But that can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial state's parity isn't +1. Let me double-check. The initial state is 1S0. The S here refers to spin, and L=0. The parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the Pauli condition. Let me re-express it.

The Pauli condition is: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.

So, for T=0, S + L +1 must be even → S + L must be odd.

So, for each option:

A) S=3, L=2 → 3+2=5 → odd. Condition met.

B) S=1, L=0 → 1+0=1 → odd. Condition met.

C) S=1, L=2 → 1+2=3 → odd. Condition met.

D) S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → even. Condition not met.

So, options A, B, C meet the Pauli condition, but their L is even → parity +1 → which doesn't match. Only option D meets parity but violates Pauli.

So, the only option that meets both is none. But the question must have an answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the NN state isn't just (-1)^L. Maybe there's more to it, like considering the exchange of the two nucleons. Because parity is a product of orbital and spin parts.

Wait, no, the parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum between the two nucleons. So, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial state's parity is not +1. Let me think again. The initial state is 1S0: L=0 → parity +1. Correct.

So, the only option that satisfies parity is D, but it doesn't meet the Pauli condition.

So, the forbidden option would be the one that doesn't meet either condition. But the question is which partial wave is not permitted.

Looking at the options, the only one that meets parity is D. But it doesn't meet the Pauli condition, so it's invalid.

Thus, the partial wave in D is s (l=0), which is allowed in parity but not in Pauli. So, it's forbidden.

Wait, but the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So, the partial wave would be the one that can't happen due to either condition.

In this case, all options except D have parity issues, but D has Pauli issues.

So, the correct answer is D, because it's the only option that meets parity but violates Pauli. So, the partial wave s is not permitted.

Wait, but the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So, the answer would be the one that can't happen due to either condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D, because even though it satisfies parity, it doesn't meet the Pauli condition, making it invalid. So, the partial wave s is not allowed.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again.

The problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So, any option where F doesn't have T=0 is invalid.

In option D, F has S=1, L=1. So, T= S + L +1 mod2 → 1+1+1=3 → mod2 is 1. So T=1, which is not allowed. So, option D is invalid.

Thus, the partial wave in D is s (l=0), which is not permitted because T would be 1, not 0.

So, the answer is option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of a two-nucleon (NN) system initially in the 1S0 state, which emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. The final NN state has isospin \( T = 0 \), and we must determine which partial wave is not permitted under the conservation of angular momentum and parity, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle.

### Key Information and Conditions:
1. **Initial State (1S0):**  
   - Spin \( S = 0 \), orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \), total angular momentum \( J = 0 \).  
   - Parity: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State:**  
   - The NN system has \( T = 0 \).  
   - The parity of the final state is determined by the product of the parity of the NN state (\( P_{\text{NN}} \)) and the parity of X (\( P_X = -1 \)):  
     \[
     P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \implies +1 = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot (-1) \implies P_{\text{NN}} = -1.
     \]  
     Thus, the parity of the NN state must be \( -1 \), which implies \( L \) (orbital angular momentum of the NN state) is odd (\( L = 1, 3, 5, \dots \)).

3. **Pauli Exclusion Principle:**  
   The isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum of the NN state satisfy:  
   \[
   T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   For \( T = 0 \), this implies:  
   \[
   S + L + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \implies S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   Therefore, \( S + L \) must be odd.

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation:**  
   The initial total angular momentum is \( J = 0 \). The final state consists of the NN state (with angular momentum \( J_{\text{NN}} \)) and the emitted particle X (with orbital angular momentum \( l \)). The vector sum of \( J_{\text{NN}} \) and \( l \) must equal \( J = 0 \).

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**
- **NN State (\( 7D1 \)):**  
  - \( 2S + 1 = 7 \implies S = 3 \), \( L = D \implies L = 2 \), \( J = 1 \).  
  - Parity of NN: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \).  
    This violates parity conservation, as \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \neq +1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Condition satisfied.  
  - **Conclusion:** Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**
- **NN State (\( 3S1 \)):**  
  - \( 2S + 1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \), \( L = S \implies L = 0 \), \( J = 1 \).  
  - Parity of NN: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).  
    This violates parity conservation, as \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \neq +1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Condition satisfied.  
  - **Conclusion:** Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**
- **NN State (\( 3D3 \)):**  
  - \( 2S + 1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \), \( L = D \implies L = 2 \), \( J = 3 \).  
  - Parity of NN: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^2 = +1 \).  
    This violates parity conservation, as \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \neq +1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). Condition satisfied.  
  - **Conclusion:** Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**
- **NN State (\( 3P0 \)):**  
  - \( 2S + 1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \), \( L = P \implies L = 1 \), \( J = 0 \).  
  - Parity of NN: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^1 = -1 \).  
    This satisfies parity conservation, as \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (-1) \cdot (-1) = +1 \).  
  - Pauli Condition: \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).  
    This does not satisfy \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).  
  - **Conclusion:** Invalid due to Pauli condition violation.

### Final Answer:
The only option that satisfies parity conservation is **D**, but it violates the Pauli exclusion principle. Therefore, the partial wave \( s \) (orbital angular momentum \( l = 0 \)) is not permitted.

**Answer: D**
