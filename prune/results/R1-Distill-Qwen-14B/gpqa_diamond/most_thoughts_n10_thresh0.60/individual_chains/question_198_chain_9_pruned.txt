Okay, let's see. I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16.

I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the stability of metal complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So the complexes with higher beta values are favored.

The species present should be various complexes of Co(II) with thiocyanate. The possible complexes are Co(SCN)^n- where n ranges from 0 to 4, I suppose. So we have Co, CoSCN^-, Co(SCN)_2^2-, Co(SCN)_3^3-, and Co(SCN)_4^4-? Wait, but wait. The formation of each complex depends on the stability constant. So each step is the addition of SCN- to the previous complex.

The problem is about finding the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2- ion. So that's the blue one, right? Or wait, I think the blue is the tetra? Or maybe the tri... I'm not exactly sure, but the question specifies dithiocyanato, so that's two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2-.

So to find the percentage, I need to calculate the fraction of the total cobalt that is in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2-.

But wait, the total cobalt includes all possible complexes: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^-, [Co(SCN)_2]^2-, [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, [Co(SCN)_4]^4-.

I think the approach is to model the distribution of cobalt between these species using the stability constants. But the stability constants are given per each step. Like beta1 is for the first ligand, beta2 for the second, etc.

Wait, no. Stability constants for each complex. Wait, the way the problem is phrased, beta1 is for [CoSCN]^-, beta2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2-, etc. So each beta represents the formation of the complex with n ligands.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let's clarify: the stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex from the metal ion and the ligands. So for the first complex, [CoSCN^-], the formation reaction would be Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ [CoSCN^-], and beta1 is the equilibrium constant for this.

Similarly, the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^2-, would form via [CoSCN^-] + SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^2-, and beta2 is the equilibrium constant for that step.

Wait, that's correct. So the overall stability constant for [Co(SCN)_
