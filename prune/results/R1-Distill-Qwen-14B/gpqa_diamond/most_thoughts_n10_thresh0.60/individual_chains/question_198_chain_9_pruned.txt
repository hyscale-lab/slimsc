Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. The given data includes the concentrations of Co(II) and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) ions, and the stability constants (β) for the different complexes. 

I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. But wait, each β corresponds to different complexes. Oh right, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, and so on.

So the complexes would be formed in a stepwise manner. Let me recall: the first complex would be [Co(SCN)]⁺, the second [Co(SCN)₂]⁺, third [Co(SCN)₃]³⁻, and the fourth [Co(SCN)₄]³⁻. Wait, but wait, the charges here matter. Each SCN⁻ is -1, so when it binds to Co²+:

- [Co(SCN)]⁺ is Co²+ + SCN⁻ → charge is 2+ -1 = +1?
Wait no, wait. Co²+ is +2. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So:

- [Co(SCN)]²+ would have a charge of +2 + (-1) = +1? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is [Co(SCN)]^{n}, so I think for each SCN⁻ added, the charge decreases. Let me think:

Co²+ has a charge of +2. When it binds one SCN⁻ (charge -1), the complex becomes [Co(SCN)]⁺ (charge +1). Then adding another SCN⁻ makes [Co(SCN)₂]⁰, neutral. Then [Co(SCN)₃]^- (because 3*-1 = -3; Co²+ → +2 → +2-3= -1). Then [Co(SCN)₄]^2- (since 4*-1 = -4; +2 -4 = -2).

Wait, but the question refers to the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one
