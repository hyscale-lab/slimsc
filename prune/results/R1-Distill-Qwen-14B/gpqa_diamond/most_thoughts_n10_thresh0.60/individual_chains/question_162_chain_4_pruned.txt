Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? But wait, maybe I should start by looking at the metric provided.

The metric is given as ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So this is in 2D, with coordinates x and y. I'm a bit confused about how this relates to the pseudosphere. I think the pseudosphere's metric is usually written in terms of its radius and some trigonometric functions, but maybe this is a different parameterization.

Wait, the question is about the area. To find the area, I think I need to compute the area element from the metric. The area element in a 2D metric is usually sqrt(g_xx g_yy - g_xy^2) dx dy, but since the metric is diagonal here (no cross terms), it's just sqrt(g_xx * g_yy) dx dy. So looking at the metric, both g_xx and g_yy are 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element should be sqrt([32/(4 - x² - y²)]^2) dx dy. Which simplifies to 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but I'm trying to compute the area of the pseudosphere. So I should set up the integral of the area element over the entire surface. The surface is defined where the denominator isn't zero, so 4 - x² - y² > 0. That means x² + y² < 4, so the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But wait, pseudosphere is a surface of revolution, so maybe it's parameterized differently. Oh, but the metric given here seems to be in terms of x and y, which might be angular coordinates or something else.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The metric given here is for a 2D surface, which is the pseudosphere. So the area would be the integral of the area element over the entire surface. But perhaps the integration region is x² + y² < 4. So the area is the double integral over x and y of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy, where x² + y² <4.

But wait, if I do this integral, what's the result
