Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so we have an uncharged spherical conductor with a cavity inside. The conductor isn't charged initially, so it's neutral. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. I remember that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute in a certain way.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged, but when we place +q in the cavity, what happens? Oh right, I think the inner surface of the conductor will induce an equal and opposite charge. So the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface must have +q because the total charge of the conductor is zero. Wait, no, wait. No, the conductor was initially neutral. So the charge +q in the cavity will cause the inner surface to have -q by induction. Then, since the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge is (inner) -q + (conductor's own charge initially 0) + (outer) +q? Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's own charge is zero. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface gets -q, and the outer surface must be +q to balance the total. Because overall, the conductor must remain neutral if it started that way. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor was neutral, so the total charge after putting +q inside would be +q. Wait, but the conductor's own charge must stay zero. Oh wait, no
