Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm.

Wait, right, the operator P is a vector operator, so it has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvector would correspond to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P·n, I think. Because when you have an operator in a particular direction, you usually take the dot product with that direction vector.

So first, I need to find the matrix representation of the operator P·n. Since n is in the x-z plane, that means it has components (nx, 0, nz). Because any direction in the x-z plane can be represented that way—since the y-component is zero.

So the operator P·n would be nx P_x + nz P_z. Since there's no y-component, the P_y term doesn't contribute.

Let me write down each component's matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So when I construct P·n, it's (ħ/2)(n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]]).

Let me compute that. Let me factor out (ħ/2): so the matrix becomes:

[[n_z*(1), n_x*(1)],
 [n_x*(1), -n_z*(1)]] 
All multiplied by ħ/2.

So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the operator is P·n, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>.

So, substituting the matrix we have:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] |ψ> = |ψ>.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Let me rearrange each equation:

1) n_z a + n_x b = a → (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0

So, we have two equations:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b =0
n_x a - (n_z +1) b =0

This is a homogeneous system, so the determinant of the coefficients must be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let me write the coefficient matrix:

| (n_z -1)   n_x      |
| n_x        -(n_z+1)|

The determinant is (n_z -1)(-(n_z +1)) - n_x * n_x
= -(n_z^2 -1) - n_x^2
= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. So, substituting:

= -n_z² +1 - (1 -n_z²) → wait, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, n is a unit vector in x-z plane, so n_x² +n_z² =1. So n_x²=1-n_z².

So the determinant becomes:

-(n_z^2 + n_x^2) +1 → Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute the determinant again.

Wait, the determinant is (n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)(n_x)
= [ -(n_z -1)(n_z +1) ] - n_x²
= [ -(n_z^2 -1) ] -n_x^2
= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2
But n_x² +n_z² =1, so n_z² =1 -n_x².

Wait, substituting n_z^2=1-n_x^2 into the determinant:

= -(1 -n_x^2) +1 - n_x^2
= -1 +n_x^2 +1 -n_x^2
= 0.

Ah, so the determinant is zero, which makes sense because we have eigenvalues, so the system has non-trivial solutions.

But since the determinant is zero, the two equations are dependent. So we can choose one equation and find the relation between a and b.

Looking at equation 1: (n_z -1) a +n_x b =0 → (n_x) b = (1 -n_z) a → b = [(1-n_z)/n_x ] a.

Similarly, equation 2: n_x a = (n_z +1) b → same as equation 1.

So the eigenvector can be expressed as [a, b]= a [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ].

But wait, I need to normalize the eigenvector. Let's denote a=1, then b=(1-n_z)/n_x.

The vector becomes (1, (1-n_z)/n_x). The normalization condition is |1|^2 + |(1-n_z)/n_x|^2 =1.

So, compute 1 + [(1-n_z)^2]/(n_x^2) =1.

But since n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1 → n_x² =1 -n_z^2.

So substituting:

1 + (1 - 2 n_z +n_z²)/(1 -n_z²) ) =1.

Wait, simplifying:

[ (1 -n_z^2) + (1 - 2n_z +n_z^2) ) ] / (1 -n_z^2) ) =1.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(1 -n_z^2) + (1 - 2n_z +n_z^2) ) = 2 -2n_z.

So numerator is 2(1 -n_z), denominator is 1 -n_z^2 = (1-n_z)(1+n_z).

So the fraction becomes [2(1-n_z)] / [ (1-n_z)(1+n_z) ) ] = 2/(1 +n_z).

So:

2/(1 +n_z) =1 → 2=1 +n_z → n_z=1.

But that can't be right because n is an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the normalization.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me parameterize n. Since n is in the x-z plane, we can write n in terms of polar coordinates. Let me define θ as the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ (since in x-z, x is the first component, z is the second), and n_z = cosθ.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ.

So our vector is [a, b] where b= [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a.

So the vector is (a, [ (1 - cosθ)/ sinθ ] a )

Let me factor a out: a (1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ )

Hmm, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ can be simplified. Using trig identities, 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So,

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(θ/2)] / [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] ] = [sin(θ/2)] / [cos(θ/2)] = tan(θ/2).

So the vector becomes a (1, tan(θ/2) )

Expressed as a (1, tan(θ/2) ), and we need to normalize this.

The normalization condition is |1|^2 + |tan(θ/2)|^2 =1.

So, [1 + tan²(θ/2)] = 1/(a^2) → since 1 + tan² x = sec² x, which is 1/(cos² x). So,

1/(cos²(θ/2)) =1/(a^2) → a^2= cos²(θ/2) → a= ± cos(θ/2).

So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by a sign factor. Since eigenvalues are positive, perhaps the sign is positive.

Wait, let me compute it. So, if a= cos(θ/2), then b= [ (1 - cosθ ) / sinθ ] * cos(θ/2).

Wait, but we can compute it as:

b= tan(θ/2) * a = tan(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2)/cos(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, that's interesting. So the normalized eigenvector is (cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)).

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but option D has sqrt terms multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, but in the problem statement, the operator is given for each component. So the operator P is a vector operator, and the eigenvector is for P·n. So the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), right?

But wait, let me think again. Because the operator P is given in terms of sigma matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the eigenstates are spin-up or spin-down along direction n. For spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates are |+n> = cos(theta/2)|+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|-z>, but since in our case, the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero. So the state would be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But wait, the options don't directly show that. Let me look at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2).

Wait, but our solution doesn't involve hbar because the eigenvectors are typically written without the Planck's constant—since they are normalized vectors, not vectors with physical dimensions.

Wait, but the options include hbar. Hmm, that's confusing. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in terms of the actual components. Let me retrace.

Wait, the components of the eigenvector are just the coefficients, which are dimensionless. But in the options, I see some with hbar, which doesn't make much sense because eigenvectors are usually normalized vectors without units. So perhaps the options are not correct in including hbar, but I need to look again.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) → these would have units of hbar, which is not correct for a vector.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) → This looks like spherical harmonics, possibly for spin-1 states, but our system is spin-1/2.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) → yes, that's what I derived.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) → again, units don't make sense.

So the only option that makes sense dimensionally and matches the result is option C.

Wait, but wait. The operator given in the problem is P = (Px, Py, Pz), each multiplied by ħ/2. So the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the eigenvector is a spin-up state along n. So the normalized eigenvector would indeed be (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each expressed as a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, so it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x P_x + n_z P_z
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}
\]
where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\hbar/2$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This gives the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
\]
Rearranging:
\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta \, b = 0, \quad \sin\theta \, a - (\cos\theta + 1)b = 0
\]
These equations are dependent, and solving for $b$ in terms of $a$ gives:
\[
b = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) a
\]

### Step 3: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]
To normalize, we impose:
\[
|a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1 \implies |a|^2 \left(1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right) = 1
\]
Using the identity $1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)$:
\[
|a|^2 \sec^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 1 \implies |a| = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for a normalized eigenvector.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ corresponds to a spin-1 state, not spin-1/2.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$ and does not match the derived result.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
