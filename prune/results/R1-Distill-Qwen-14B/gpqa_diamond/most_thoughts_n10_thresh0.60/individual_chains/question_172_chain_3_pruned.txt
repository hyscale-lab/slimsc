Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that the photosphere is the outermost layer of a star where most of the light is emitted. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The problem is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures, T1 and T2, assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium).

Wait, LTE means that in each small region of the star's photosphere, the gas behaves according to the laws of thermodynamics, so the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution applies. Right, the population of energy levels depends on the temperature.

So, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The population ratio of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ). Oh wait, I think the formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote ΔE as this value. The ratio of populations is n1/n2 = 2, because star_1 has twice the excitation (so n1 is higher than n2? Wait, no, wait. The question says iron atoms
