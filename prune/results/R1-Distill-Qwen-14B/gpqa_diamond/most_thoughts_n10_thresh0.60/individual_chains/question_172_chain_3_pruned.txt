Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of energy levels in their atmospheres follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy states to temperature.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the ratio of their populations is 2. Let me denote the energy levels as E1 and E2. Wait, no, the problem states the energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, but maybe the specific energy level is the same for both stars? Or no, perhaps each star's iron atoms have their own energy levels, but the difference is the same, 1.38e-23 J for both?

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is approximately 1.38e-23 J. So that's the same ΔE for both stars. So the energy levels are E and E + ΔE for each star.

In LTE, the population ratio of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature.

In this case, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or some reference state) is given. So for star 1, the excited level is twice that of star 2. Let me think. Wait, no, the excited level in star_1 is twice as excited (i.e., twice as populated) compared to star_2. So the ratio for star_1 is higher, meaning higher temperature because higher temperature means more excitation.

Wait, the ratio of populations is n1/n2 = 2. But wait, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited (I think this refers to the population of a higher energy level compared to the lower one). So for each star, the ratio is different. Let's think in terms of each star's own n_high / n_low.

For star_1: n1_high / n1_low = ratio1.

For star_2: n2_high / n2_low = ratio2.

The problem says that ratio
