Okay, I've got this question about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about each part step by step.

So the first reaction is dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a dienolate. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (the enolate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, so dimethyl malonate has two ester groups. When it acts as a nucleophile, the enolate would form at the beta position. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually, the substituents are arranged in a specific way. The acrylate is E, so the p-tolyl group and the methyl ester are on opposite sides. But for the addition, the nucleophile will attack the beta carbon of the acrylate.

So when dimethyl malonate (which is (CH3COO)2CH-) donates its enolate, the attack would occur on the acrylate's double bond. Let me draw it mentally. The acrylate has the structure CH2-CO-OCH3, but wait, no, correct structure is CH2=C-(CO-OCH3). Wait, no, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Oh, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 where the substituents on either end of the double bond are a p-tolyl group on one end and the methyl ester on the other? No, wait, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(C6H4-4Me) group. Or wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate means the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2? No, acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but with the substituents. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)COOCH3? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(C6H4-4Me)OCH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, wait, the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the formula is CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3. So, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (if the COOCH3 is on carbon 3), but I'm not sure. Maybe a better way is to think that the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is the acrylate. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the beta carbon? Hmm, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2-CH(C6H4-4Me)COOCH3, but the double bond is between the first and second carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's structured as CH2=CH–C(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the acrylate is CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-p-tolyl
