Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again. The question says an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are A to D, each with a different expression.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula: the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector again. Wait, wait, no, more accurately, for a state |ψ⟩, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩.

Wait, but wait, the state is given as (3i, 4). Oh, right, that's a column vector. So the state vector ψ is [3i; 4]. So the first component is 3i, the second is 4.

The spin operator for the y-direction, sigma y, is given as a matrix:

0  -i
i   0

And since spin operators are ħ times the Pauli matrices, right? So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by sigma_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So to find the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll write the state vector ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]

The conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3  4 ] because the first component is 3i, its conjugate is -3, and the second is 4, which is real.

So ψ† is [ -3   4 ]

Now, compute ψ† multiplied by S_y. Wait, no, actually, the expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ. So I need to compute ψ† times S_y times ψ.

Wait, let's compute each part. Let's first compute S_y ψ.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let's compute S_y multiplied by ψ.

So S_y ψ would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix product of [[0, -i], [i, 0]] and [3i; 4].

Let me compute each component
