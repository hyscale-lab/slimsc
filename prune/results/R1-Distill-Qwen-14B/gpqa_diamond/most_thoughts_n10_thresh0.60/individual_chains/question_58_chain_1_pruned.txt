Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can make the theory predictions problematic, so regularization helps to make the calculations finite and then you remove the regularization (renormalize) to get physical results.

So the question is asking which of these theories doesn't need regularization. That probably means the theory is finite or doesn't produce these divergences. Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't usually deal with quantum effects, so they don't have the same kinds of infinities as quantum theories. Like, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have issues with renormalization because there's no such process in classical physics. So maybe option D is the correct answer.

But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory, right? It's an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. So it should deal with high energies, and I think string theories might require some form of regularization or maybe they naturally avoid some divergences because of the way they model particles as strings instead of points. But I'm not entirely sure if they never need regularization. I think even string theories might have some issues, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This is the theory of the strong interaction. QCD does require renormalization because of the running coupling and the presence of things like Landau poles. Wait, but I remember that QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, making perturbative calculations manageable. But does it require regularization? Yes, because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences which need to be handled by renormalization. So QCD does require regularization, so option B is not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I know that QED does require renormal
