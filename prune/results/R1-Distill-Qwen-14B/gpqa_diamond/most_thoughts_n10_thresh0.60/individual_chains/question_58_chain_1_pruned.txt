Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm supposed to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is: Which of the following physical theories never requires regularization at high energies?

The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations. Without regularization, these infinities can make the math blow up, so you need a way to make the calculations finite, even if temporarily. Then you do renormalization to absorb those infinities into physical parameters like mass and charge.

So, the question is about which theory doesn't need regularization. That probably means the theory is already finite, meaning no divergences occur, or perhaps it's a classical theory which doesn't have the same issues as quantum ones.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't deal with quantum effects, so I don't think they require regularization. But wait, in classical physics, do they have any divergences? Oh right, in classical electromagnetism, there are issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. But I think those are handled within classical methods, maybe through some approximations or excluding point charges. Or perhaps it's considered that the theory is a limit where such infinities aren't a problem because you don't have the same issues as in quantum theories. So maybe classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have the same divergent loop integrals that quantum theories face.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). I know QED is a quantum field theory and it does require regularization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy, you get divergences. So you need to regularize, maybe using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or Pauli-Villars methods. Then you renormalize. So QED does require regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and I think it also requires regularization. Because when you calculate Feynman diagrams in QCD, especially with loops, you get divergent terms. So you need regularization techniques, perhaps something like lattice regularization or others. But wait, QCD is asymptot
