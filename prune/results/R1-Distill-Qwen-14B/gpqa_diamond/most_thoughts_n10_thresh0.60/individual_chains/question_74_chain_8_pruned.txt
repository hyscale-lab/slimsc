Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the decay probability of a single atom. They've given some data: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, right now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. So, the initial time is zero, and we start monitoring. 50 minutes pass, no decay. Now, we want to know the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, but 50 +150 is 200 minutes total. But the given probability is for 100 minutes. Hmm.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability of decay depends on the time elapsed, not on when you start watching. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the overall decay constant or the probability beyond that point.

But wait, the probability given is 32% within 100 minutes. That must be the probability that the atom decays at some point within that time. So, the survival probability after time t is 1 minus the decay probability. Alternatively, I can model the decay using the decay constant.

The formula for the probability of decay over a time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is
