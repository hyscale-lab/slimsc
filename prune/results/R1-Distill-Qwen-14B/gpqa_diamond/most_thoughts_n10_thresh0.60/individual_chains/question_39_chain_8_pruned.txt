Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it out.

The question is about a wave function and finding the normalizing constant 'a'. So from what I remember, the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, which means the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should equal 1. Because probabilities must add up to 1.

So the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) minus 0.5i. Wait, wait. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the wave function is usually a complex number, but the probability density is the square of the absolute value. So the absolute square is (ψ)(ψ*), where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

Wait, but looking at the wave function: (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. Oh, so the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5. So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i.

The problem states that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found at x <1 and x>3. So the wave function is zero outside x=1 and x=3? Or does it just mean that the probability is zero there? Hmm, no, wait. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i, but when they measure, they don't find any particles outside 1 and 3. So that suggests that the wave function is zero outside that interval. Or maybe the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Because if particles aren't found outside, the probability is zero there.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because the wave function given is [a/sqrt(1+x)] -0.5i, but if that's only for a certain part of space, perhaps between x=1 and x=3. So maybe the wave function is zero outside that region. But the problem says each system's particle can exist in a part of space where the wave function is as given. Hmm, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the probability density is zero elsewhere.

So to normalize the wave function, we need to integrate |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 and set that equal to 1.

So first, let's compute |ψ(x)|². Since ψ(x) = A - 0.5i, where A is a real function (a/sqrt(1+x)), the absolute square is (A)^2 + (0.5)^2. Because (a + ib)(a - ib) is a² + b². So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

Wait, wait, no. Let me be careful. ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (-0.5)i. So the complex conjugate ψ*(x) is [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + 0.
