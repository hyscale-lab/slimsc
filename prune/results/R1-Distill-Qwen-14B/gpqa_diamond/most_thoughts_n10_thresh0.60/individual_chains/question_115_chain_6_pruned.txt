Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic collisions and photon production. But I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem says: An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since energy and momentum must be conserved, I think I need to consider the conservation laws here.

Wait, electrons and positrons have equal mass, but opposite charges. So, in this case, the electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left along the horizontal axis), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). So they're approaching each other.

But wait, the electron is moving from left to right, and the positron is moving from right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Next, their Lorentz factors. The electron has a Lorentz factor γ_e =4, and the positron γ_p =2. Lorentz factor is gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need the velocities directly. Maybe I can work with their energies and momenta.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is m_e c², which is about 0.511 MeV. But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, their total energy is γ times the rest energy.

So the electron's energy is γ_e * m_e c² = 4 m_e c². Similarly, the positron's energy is γ_p * m_e c² = 2 m_e c².

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait a second. Electrons and positrons have the same rest mass. So when considering their energy, the positron's energy is also γ times m_e c².

But wait, positron is moving from the right, so perhaps I should consider their momentum directions. Let's think about this.

The electron is moving along the positive x-direction (since from left to right) and the positron along the negative x-direction (
