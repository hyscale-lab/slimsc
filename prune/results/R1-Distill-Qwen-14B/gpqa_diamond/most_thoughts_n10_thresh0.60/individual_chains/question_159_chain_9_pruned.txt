Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quasar question. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations and cosmological parameters. 

First, I remember that comoving distance is a way to measure the distance to an object in the universe, taking into account the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance depends on the redshift (z) of the object and the integral involving the Hubble parameter over the expansion history.

The problem says that the quasar shows a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Oh wait, I think I've heard about the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to the Lyman-alpha emission line. The Lyman-alpha line is emitted when electrons in hydrogen atoms drop from the second energy level to the first, which is at a wavelength of about 121.6 nm (this is in the far-ultraviolet). 

So if the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is much longer than 121.6 nm, that suggests a redshift. Redshift (z) is calculated by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So let's compute that. Observed is 790 nm, rest is 121.6 nm. 790 divided by 121.6 is roughly... let's see, 121.6 times 6 is 729.6, which is less than 790. 121.6 * 6.5 is 789.2, which is very close. So 6.5 times. So z = 6.5 - 1 = 5.5. Wait, wait, no, wait. The formula is (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790/121.6 is about 6.499, so z is approximately 5.499, so around z=5.5.

But wait, why is the peak at 790 nm and not lower? Because maybe the quasar is at a redshift where the Lyman-alpha emission is redshifted into the observed near-infrared. So z is about 5.5.

Now, the comoving distance D is related to the redshift. The formula for comoving distance is D = c * ∫(1/(H0 * E(z))) dz, where E(z) is the function sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda) for a flat universe. Oh wait, but the integral is from 0 to z, and for a flat universe with matter density Ω_m=0.3 and dark energy Ω_Λ=0.7, which matches the given parameters.

But wait, calculating that integral exactly would require some computation. I don't remember the exact integral, but I know that for a given z, you can look up or calculate the comoving distance using standard expressions or approximation formulas.

Another thought: The comoving distance for a quasar at z=5 would be about how much? I think for higher redshifts, the comoving distance increases. For example, for z=1, the comoving distance is roughly 1.6 billion light-years, but that's way smaller in
