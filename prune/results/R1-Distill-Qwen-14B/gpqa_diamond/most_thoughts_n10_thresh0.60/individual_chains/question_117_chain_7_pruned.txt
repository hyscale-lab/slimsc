Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me about optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Let me think step by step.

First, what's optical isomerism? Oh right, it's about stereoisomerism where the mirror images of a compound aren't superimposable, leading to different optical properties. This happens when there's a chiral center or a situation with non-superimposable mirror images, like in geometric isomerism or something else.

The question lists four compounds, and I have to decide which ones can show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have different arrangements. Wait, if the substituents are on different positions on the benzene rings, maybe there's some kind of stereoisomerism. Oh, but biphenyls usually have rotation around the central bond. Unless there's some kind of rigidity. Wait, maybe this is about the substituents on both rings. If both substituents on each ring are in positions that cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry, maybe it's not chiral. But wait, the substituents are at positions 2 on each ring and 6 on each ring. Let me visualize: each phenyl ring has substituents at 2 and 6, but wait, the main chain is 1,1'-biphenyl, so each ring is attached at position 1. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. Wait, no, no, maybe the main structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, so each ring is connected at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me think: So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. Wait, but in biphenyls, the substituents on each ring can lead to different arrangements. If the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it might have optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. If both substituents are in positions that mirror each other, then no chiral centers. Hmm, but wait, are there any chiral centers in this compound? Let me look
