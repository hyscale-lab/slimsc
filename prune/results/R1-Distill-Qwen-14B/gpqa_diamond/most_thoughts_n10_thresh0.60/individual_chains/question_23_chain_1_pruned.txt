Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it. The question is about a reaction involving a specific compound reacting with hydrogen bromide, and the possible products based on TLC results.

The compound given is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw that structure out in my mind. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group, which has substituents on the second carbon. So the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, butene is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- attached to the oxygen? Hmm, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The structure of but-3-en-1-yl would be like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at carbon 3. Oh wait, but but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2CH2CH=CH, but wait, wait, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH=CH- but when counting from the point of attachment. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- but wait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is the substituent on the oxygen. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that would be 1-yl. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing the numbering. Let me think: the butenyl group is attached via the first carbon, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH-
