Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D with different exponents. 

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? I remember that parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So plx = 1/distance. So if plx is small, the stars are far away, and if plx is large, they're close.

The question is about the number of stars per unit change in plx. So like, for a given range of plx values, how many stars do we expect? Since stars are uniformly distributed, their actual distances (or parallaxes) would follow some distribution based on how much volume is at a certain distance.

Wait, I'm thinking about volume in three dimensions. The number of stars in a volume element should relate to the volume. Let's see. In three dimensions, the volume of a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is 4πr² dr. Because the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², and if you multiply by dr, it's the volume of the shell.

But since we're talking about parallax, which is 1/d, perhaps I should express this in terms of plx. Let me think: plx is p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. Then, dr = -1/p² dp. Hmm, because differentiating d = 1/p gives dr = -1/p² dp. So the thickness in distance units is related to the change in parallax.

Wait, the volume element in terms of dr is 4πr² dr. Substituting dr in terms of dp. So dr = - (1/p²) dp. Since we're dealing with positive changes, the negative sign just indicates direction, so we can ignore it for the magnitude. So the volume becomes 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, no. Because d = 1/p, so r is d, which is 1/p. So r squared is (1/p)^2. So 4π (1/p)^2 * (dr) becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp). Wait, that can't be right. Wait
