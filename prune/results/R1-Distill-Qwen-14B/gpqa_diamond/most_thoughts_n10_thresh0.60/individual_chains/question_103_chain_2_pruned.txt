Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the main structure is a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, numbering? In benzene rings, positions are numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, let me imagine the benzene ring. If the ketone is attached at position 1, then substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (position 1), bromo (position 3), and nitro (position 5). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one is a two-carbon chain where the ketone is on the first carbon. That carbon is attached to the phenyl group. So the phenyl group is at position 1 of the ketone. So the benzene ring is attached to the ketone's first carbon.

So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment (position 1). So, if the ketone is on carbon 1, then the benzene ring is attached there, and the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 of the benzene. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro), right?

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the numbering might vary. Let me draw it out mentally. The ketone is at position 1, attached to the benzene. Then, on the benzene, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone attachment. So the three substituents are at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO
