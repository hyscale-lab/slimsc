Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm supposed to figure out the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star. Hmm, let me think.

Alright, the setup: the star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, 20% filling factor. The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness changes. Without the spots, we're to find the exoplanet radius that would cause the same signal in the light curve.

Wait, so if the star wasn't spotted, what would the light curve look like when a planet transits? The drop in brightness would be proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is the area of the planet over the area of the star.

But in this case, the star has these spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer. The total brightness variation would depend on the spots' coverage and temperature difference.

The question says that the photometric observations would show periodic variations due to rotation, which could mimic an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of this variation is the same as what the planet would cause.

So I need to calculate the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

First, let's model the brightness variation from the spots. The spots are on one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area of the spots on the hemisphere is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

Wait, the star's radius is Rstar, same as the Sun. The star's surface area is 4πRstar². The hemisphere is 2πRstar², so the area with spots is 0.2 * 2πRstar² = 0.4πRstar².

Each spot is cooler, at Teff - 1000K = 5000K? Or wait, the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K less than that. So 5000K.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be Lstar = 4πRstar² σ Teff^4.

When the spots are present on the hemisphere, the spots emit less. The spots contribute less flux. So the total flux from the star is the normal flux (from the unspotted areas) plus the flux from the spots.

Wait, the flux from the spots is less. So the total flux when the spots are facing us is less than when they are not.

The flux when the spots are visible is F_total = F_unspotted + F_spots.

But wait, the unspotted area is the hemisphere minus the spots. Wait, the entire visible hemisphere is either spotted or not? No, the spots are 20% of the hemisphere. So the unspotted part is 80% of the hemisphere.

So F_unspotted = (0.8) * (area of hemisphere) * σ Teff^4 / (area per unit) ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total flux when the spots are visible and when they are not.

The star's flux without any spots would be F0 = σ Teff^4. The total flux when the spots are on the hemisphere would be F = (1 - f) * F0 + f * σ (Teff - ΔT)^4, where f is the filling factor.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. Because the spots are on the hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view. So when the star is at a certain rotation phase, the spots are in the visible hemisphere, and when
