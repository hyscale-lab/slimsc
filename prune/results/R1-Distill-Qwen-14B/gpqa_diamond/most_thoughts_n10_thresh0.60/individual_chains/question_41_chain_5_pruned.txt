Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a light beam moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab?

Hmm. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the vacuum speed. But wait, here the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed as observed?

Wait, I'm getting confused. So, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly because of the way velocities transform. But wait, is this problem in the realm of classical mechanics or relativity? The options don't look like they're applying any relativistic formulas, so maybe this is a classical approach.

Wait, but in classical mechanics, speeds just add up. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light in the glass is moving at speed v_light = c/n (since it's in glass), then the observer would see the light moving at v_light + v? Because both are moving in the same direction.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So if the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer, then the light's speed relative to the lab would be the speed of light in glass plus the speed of the glass. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let's think about it. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light inside the glass is moving at speed u = c/n relative to the glass. So from the lab frame, the speed of the light would be u plus v, because both are in the same direction.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the speed of light in the glass is u = c/n, right? So when you add the velocity of the source (the glass) moving towards you, the observed speed would be u + v. So that would be (c/n) + v. But wait, c is 1 in this problem, so u is 1/n.

So would the speed be (1/n) + v? But wait, the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) (1 + n*v)/(n + v)
B) 1
