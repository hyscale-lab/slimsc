Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation, which I think relates to temperature somehow.

Wait, the peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law, right? Wien's displacement law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So the equation is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Oh, so T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait. Because the stars are different sizes and masses, but same peak wavelength, so same temperature. That's an important point.

Now, the question is about their luminosities. Luminosity of a star as a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. But wait, what other data do we have?

Oh, the radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0 km/s, so maybe it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has 700 km/s. But how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Hmm, I'm not sure. Radial velocity could affect the observed flux but not the intrinsic luminosity. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property—it's the total energy emitted per second. So perhaps the radial velocity is a red herring here, or maybe it's used for another part of the problem.

Wait, but the problem says they calculated the luminosity assuming the stars radiate as blackbodies. So perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux but not the calculated luminosity. Because the
