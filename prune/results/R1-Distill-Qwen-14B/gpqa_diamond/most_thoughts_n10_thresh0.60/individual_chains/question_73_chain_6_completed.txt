Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The problem says there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The second is 3m and moving at 0.5c, same direction. I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, wait. Do I have that right? Oh wait, no, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction, so v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me write it out. v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Simplify numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c. So that narrows it down to C or D.

Now for the total energy. I think each astronaut's energy should be calculated using the relativistic energy formula, which is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)). So I need to compute the energy for each and then sum them.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.4641 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². Which is about 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is lower.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches the relative speed in options C and D.

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system using the relativistic energy formula for each astronaut:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.4641m c^2
\]

The total energy is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.4641m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

Thus, the total energy is approximately \(5.96m c^2\), which matches option C. Option D, which states \(E = 5m c^2\), is incorrect as it underestimates the total energy.

Combining the relative speed and total energy, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
