Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let me start by recalling what I know about quantitative PCR and calibration curves.

So, the scientist is making a calibration curve. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it into different concentrations. He ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which means the PCR is perfect—each cycle doubles the DNA. R-squared is 1, so the data fits perfectly to the curve. The slope is -3.3. Hmm, wait, the slope in a qPCR curve—how does that work?

In a standard qPCR calibration curve, the data is usually modeled with the formula: Ct = a + b(log copies). The slope (b) is related to the efficiency. If the efficiency is 100%, then the efficiency E is 1, and the formula becomes Ct = a - 3.3219 * log(copies). Because when E=1, the slope should be -3.3219, approximately. So the slope here is -3.3, which is close enough, probably due to rounding.

Now, looking at the data. For each concentration, he has three Ct values. Let's see if they're consistent.

At 100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is around 34.2. The variation is about 0.3 between the replicates.

Similarly, 10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Again, about 0.3 variation.

1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Same pattern.

100 copies: 24,24.3,24.6. Same as before.

10 copies: 20.7, 21,21.3. Again, the same.

Wait, but the question is about discrepancies in his results. The options are pointing towards issues with the data. Let me look at the options.

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, that's not true. qPCR is used all the time for quantification. So A is wrong.

Option B: Ct values not in agreement with target amounts. But the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, so the data should fit perfectly. The Ct values are lower as the copy number decreases, which makes sense. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Let me think. Each ten-fold dilution should result in a change of 3.32 Ct values because of the log base 10. So each dilution step (like from 10000 to 1000 copies, which is a tenfold decrease) should cause the Ct to increase by about 3.32. Looking at his data:

From 10,000 to 1,000: 30.6 to 27.3. The difference is about 3.3. Oh, that's exactly matching. Similarly, 1,000 to 100: 27.3 to 24.0—3.3 difference. 100 to 10: 24 to 20.7—again, 3.3. So each tenfold dilution leads to a Ct change of about 3.3. So why is this an issue? Wait, option C says "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles." Wait, the change was exactly 3.3. So the ten-fold dilution caused a 3.3 Ct difference, which matches the expected 3.32 (due to log10(2) ≈ 0.301, so 1/E=1, so 3.3219 per decade). So the change is about 3.3, which the question says the slope is -3.3. So that's correct. So why would option C be correct? Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the option.

Wait, the option says "Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles." Wait, no, because each ten-fold dilution corresponds to a 3.3 cycle change. So it's exactly the expected amount. So perhaps this isn't the issue. Alternatively, maybe the option is pointing out that the ten-fold dilution doesn't correspond to exactly 3.3 cycles. Wait, but in this case, the data shows exactly 3.3 cycles change per ten-fold. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data, the deviations are about 0.3 (e.g., 33.9, 34.2, 34.5: max - min is 0.6, so standard deviation would be around 0.2 perhaps). So the deviation between the replicates is about 0.3, which is within acceptable limits for technical replicates. So D says the deviation is more than 0.3, which is not the case here.

Wait, but the question is about discrepancies in his results. Hmm. Let me think again. All the data points are consistent with a perfect curve, but perhaps there's an issue with the assumption that the efficiency is 100%? But the question states the efficiency is 100%, so that's a given.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the Ct values are in the range where the efficiency might drop. But the question states efficiency is 100%, so that's not the case.

Wait, but I'm looking for discrepancies in his results. The data seems perfectly aligned with the expected values. So why are the Ct values varying only 0.3 between replicates? That's actually pretty good.

Wait, looking back at the question, what is the question exactly? The question is asking which of the options explains the discrepancies in his results. So why are there discrepancies.

Wait, perhaps the data doesn't have discrepancies, but the question is using 'discrepancies' as a trick. But looking at the options, the question is about why the results are as they are.

Wait, the options are suggesting possible problems. So which option is correct.

Option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each ten-fold dilution in concentration would lead to a change in Ct of about 3.3 cycles. So the difference between each dilution is 3.3. So for example, from 10
