Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a column vector, and the elements are complex numbers, right? But here, the elements are real. So, maybe that's fine. I remember that the state vector needs to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components should equal 1.

Wait, let's calculate the norm of this state. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the squares would be 1, 4, 1. Adding them up gives 6. Oh, that's not 1. So that means the state isn't normalized. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first. But the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. Hmm, maybe the matrix P is such that it's okay, or perhaps the observable's measurement probabilities don't require the state to be normalized? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given vector is normalized, but when I calculated 1 +4 +1 =6, I must have made a mistake. Wait, no, 1 squared is 1, 2 squared is 4, 1 squared is 1. Sum is 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state is not
