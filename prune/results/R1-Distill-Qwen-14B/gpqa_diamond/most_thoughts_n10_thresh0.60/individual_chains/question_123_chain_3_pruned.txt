Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which means no acceleration involved—so I can probably use the basic principles of relativity or maybe just Newtonian mechanics since the speed might be high but maybe not relativistic enough to complicate things.

Wait, the problem gives the speed from the ejecta's frame of reference. From the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. That makes sense because velocities reverse in different frames if they're moving at each other.

The question is asking how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, wait a second, time isn't the same in both frames. Because of time dilation in special relativity, right? But wait, the problem doesn't say anything about relativistic speeds affecting the time measurement. Hmm, but 60,000 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me calculate that as a fraction of c.

The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2 times the speed of light, which is 20% of c. That's pretty fast, so relativistic effects might matter. But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and rotation/revolution, so maybe it's just a straightforward velocity transformation or time consideration?

Wait, no, in this case, the problem is about how much distance is covered in the Galaxy's frame, given time measured in the ejecta's frame. So I think I need to consider how time in one frame relates to the other.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a simple question using classical mechanics, but I'm not sure. Let me think through both approaches.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So if the ejecta's frame says 50 seconds have passed, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame? Or perhaps, since the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, the time experienced by the ejecta is different due to time dilation.

Wait, but the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, would that time be longer or shorter? Since the ejecta is moving at a significant fraction of c, time dilation would apply. The proper time experienced by the ejecta (moving clock) is less than the time measured by the stationary observer (Galaxy's frame). So t_galaxy = gamma * t_ejecta.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute v first. v = 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2c.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96)
