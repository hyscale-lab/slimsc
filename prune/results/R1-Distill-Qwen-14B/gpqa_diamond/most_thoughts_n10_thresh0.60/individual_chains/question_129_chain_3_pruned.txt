Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what compound E is. Let's take it step by step. 

The problem starts with compound A reacting with HCN to form compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to give C. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and D loses an inert gas to become E. 

Looking at the hints, the first hint says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorus ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. So A must be an aldehyde or ketone reacting with a ylide to form an alkene. 

The structure given after the ylide reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that mentally. Cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 being methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is like a CH2-C(CH3)= group attached. So the ylide probably added across a carbonyl to form that double bond.

Wait, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes from aldehydes/ketones. So if the product has a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that came from the ylide, maybe compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because the ylide adds to the carbonyl, making the double bond.

So A is a ketone, maybe something like cyclopentanone with substituents. Let me think. The product has propan-2-ylidene, which is (CH3)2C=, so the ylide was (CH3)2P=CH2CH(CH3)? No, wait, the ylide structure would be more like (CH3)2C-P= something. Alternatively, the ylide could be (CH3)2C=PH+ where the ylide is attacking the carbonyl.

Wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C=, so the structure would be a cyclopentane ring where carbon 4 has a substituent
