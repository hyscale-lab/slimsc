Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. Let's start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the reaction scheme is:
- Compound A reacts with HCN to produce B.
- B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
- C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
- D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

Also, there are two hints provided. Let's go through them one by one.

Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm. I remember that phosphorus ylides are used in the Wittig reaction. The Wittig reaction typically converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So that implies that compound A is a carbonyl compoundâ€”either an aldehyde or ketone.

The product of the Wittig reaction is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw that structure mentally. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 4. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)- group attached via the ylidene (double bond) to the ring.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene). Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=. So it's a double bond from the ring to a CH2-C(CH3) group. So the ring is cyclopentane with substituents at 1, 2, and 4. So positions 1 and 2 have methyl groups, and position 4 has the propan-2-ylidene group. 

So the starting material for the Wittig reaction (compound A) must have a carbonyl group that, when the Wittig reagent attacks, forms that alkene. Let me think about the structure of compound A. In the Wittig reaction, the carbonyl group (C=O) reacts with the ylide to form a new double bond. So the position of the carbonyl in A would determine where the substituents end up.

If the Wittig product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, then compound A must have a carbonyl group in a position that, upon reaction, leads to that structure. Let's imagine that compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. For example, if A is 2-methylcyclopentanone, then the Wittig reaction would add a new substituent adjacent to the existing methyl group?

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider what the starting aldehyde or ketone would look like. The Wittig reagent would have a structure that, when it reacts, forms the double bond. Wait, the ylide is the reagent, so perhaps the structure of A is a cyclopentanone with a substituent that will end up at position 4 after the reaction.

Alternatively, maybe A is a substituted cyclopentanone. Let me think about how the Wittig reaction would proceed. The ylide has a structure like :P=CH-CH(CH3)- something? Wait, the product has the propan-2-ylidene group, which is (CH2)C(CH3)=, so the ylide must have been that part. So the ylide structure would be something like (CH2)C(CH3)-P= something.

Wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the double bond is between C4 and the propan-2-ylidene group. So the starting carbonyl compound must have a carbonyl group that, when the Wittig reagent (propan-2-yl) adds, forms that double
