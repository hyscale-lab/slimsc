Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. I remember that in such reactions, conservation laws like conservation of energy and momentum must hold. Also, since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, but wait, the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps we can consider it's at rest? Because if it's moving slowly, maybe its momentum is negligible, which would simplify things.

The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. I'm assuming that's the rest mass energy of particle A. So each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c².

So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton has a mass of about 938 MeV/c², same as the antiproton because they're matter and antimatter. So the total rest mass energy on the left side would be 938 + 938 = 1876 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the initial particles are moving. The problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest? Or are both moving? Hmm, not sure. Wait, the problem states the antiproton is slowly moving, implying that its velocity is much less than c. So perhaps its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. So for initial calculations, maybe I can consider it as being at rest, or at least that its momentum can be neglected compared to the proton.

Wait, no, the setup is that the antiproton is moving slowly. So let's think about the initial momentum. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some low velocity. So in the initial frame, the antiproton has some momentum, and the proton is at rest. So the total initial momentum is that of the antiproton.

But when the annihilation happens, the products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. So the total momentum after must equal the initial momentum. But this could get complicated because multiple particles are produced. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to work in the center-of-momentum frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity of particle
