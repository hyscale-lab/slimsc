Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the 3,0,0 state into the 1,0,0 state through two dipole transitions. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions between energy levels are governed by the selection rules. For dipole transitions, the change in the angular momentum quantum number l is ±1. So, for each transition, l can increase or decrease by 1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is |1,0,0⟩, so n=1, l=0, m=0. But wait, the transition is via two steps, each a dipole transition. So we need two steps, each changing l by ±1.

Wait, but the initial state is l=0. So the first transition must take l from 0 to 1 because l can't go negative beyond 0. So the first step must go to l=1. So the first possible state is |n', 1, m'⟩. What about the second transition? The second transition must go from l=1 to l=0, because we end up at l=0 in the final state.

So the steps are: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0, perhaps? Or maybe another possibility with different m values.

Wait, but let's think about the selection rules for m. The magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1 in each transition. So in the first transition, m starts at 0. It can go to m=+1, 0, or -1. Similarly for the second transition.

But the final state has m=0, so the second transition must end with m=0. Let's consider each transition.

First transition: 3,0,0 → something. Since l changes from 0 to 1, n must decrease by 1 or 2? Wait, for hydrogen, the energy levels depend on n. The selection rule for n is that it can go to any higher or lower n, but in dipole transitions, it's usually n changes by ±1 or more? Or is it more about Δn not being restricted? Wait no, the main selection rule for
