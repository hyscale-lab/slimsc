Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions with two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. The options give different starting materials for A and B, and I have to pick the correct pair.

Hmm, I remember that reducing agents like LiBH4 and BH3 (like BH3Â·THF) are used for different types of reductions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used for ketones to form secondary alcohols. But wait, in some cases, especially with esters or other carbonyl groups, the reduction might lead to different products.

Wait, wait. Oh right, BH3 is typically used for the hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes. Wait, hydroboration follows anti-Markovnikov addition, and the geometry of the alkene and the borane addition dictates the stereochemistry of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, but in this problem, the products are tetrahydropyran-2-ones. So they're cyclic ketones. Wait, no, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone at position 2. So the structure is a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, but how do you get from a starting material to that product via LiBH4 or BH3. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are esters or ketals that upon reduction form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting materials are esters or ketals. Let me think about the product. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is five-membered? No, wait, pyran is six-membered. So let's draw it. The ring has five carbons and one oxygen, making six members. The ketone is at position 2, so the ring is:

O

C2

C3---C4---C5---C6

Wait, maybe it's arranged as:

Positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So the ketone is at position 2, and there
