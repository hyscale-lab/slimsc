Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from Compound A. Let's break down the information given.

First, Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and their splitting can give clues about the structure.

A triplet usually arises when a proton is next to a CH2 group, because each proton in the neighboring CH2 would split the signal into a triplet. But wait, if it's a triplet for 6H, maybe it's two equivalent CH3 groups each split by a neighboring CH2. Because 6H could be two CH3 groups. So maybe something like two methyl groups attached to a CH2.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppmâ€”those are probably the methyl groups. 0.9 is typical for CH3. So two CH3 groups, each as a triplet. Each CH3 is next to a CH2, so each would be a triplet. But how?

Let's think about the other signal: a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. 4H suggests a CH2CH2 group perhaps, like an ethyl group. Quartet would mean each of these protons is next to a CH2 group. Like, if it's a CH2 next to another CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like an ethyl group connected to two methyl groups. No, wait, maybe it's a diethyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a di-substituted something, like neopentyl or similar.

Wait, another approach: the splitting between the two signals. The 6H (triplet) and 4H (quartet). Since they are likely adjacent, perhaps the quartet is a CH2 next to a CH(CH3)2, but I'm not sure. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, another possibility: if the two CH3 groups are on adjacent carbons. So, for instance, a -CH2-CH(CH3)2 group. But that would give the CH3 as a triplet because they're next to a CH2. The CH2 would be a quartet
