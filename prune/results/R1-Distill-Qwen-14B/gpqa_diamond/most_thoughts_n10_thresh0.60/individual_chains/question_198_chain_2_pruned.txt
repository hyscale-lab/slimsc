Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, wait, what's the blue dithiocyanato complex? I think Co with two SCN- ligands, so that would be the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But I'm not entirely sure about the color. Oh well, the question specifies it's the blue one, so I'll go with that.

Stability constants are given for four complexes. The stability constant, β, tells us how stable a complex is. The higher β, the more stable the complex. So the complexes would form in the order of their β values. Let's list the possible complexes:

Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN- as ligands. The possible complexes are:

- Co^(2+) (free ion)
- Co(SCN)^(2+), which is the first complex (n=1)
- Co(SCN)_2^2+ (n=2)
- Co(SCN)_3^(2−) (n=3)
- Co(SCN)_4^(2−) (n=4)

Wait, wait. The problem lists four β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd because β usually increases with the number of ligands, but β4 is lower than β3. So maybe I got the order wrong. Let me think again. 

Wait, the stability constants are for each step of complex formation. So β1 is the formation constant for the first ligand, β2 is for the second, etc. So, the overall formation constant for a complex with n ligands is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, actually, the stability constants are for each successive addition. So the formation constant K for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn. So for Co(SCN)_1^2+, K1 = β1 =9. For Co(SCN)_2^2+, K2=β1*β2=9*40=360. Similarly, K3=9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. K4=9*40*63*16= let me calculate that. 9*40 is 360, 360*63 is 22680, and
