Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations given are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, stability constants (β) are for the formation of complexes. I remember that each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex with a certain number of ligands. So β1 is for the first complex, Co(SCN)_1, β2 for the second, Co(SCN)_2, and so on.

The problem wants the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2 complex because "di" means two. But wait, no, maybe I should double-check. Oh wait, the blue dithiocyanato is the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, I think. Because in the stability constants, β3 is 63, which is the highest. So the most stable complex is probably the triply charged one, but the question is about the blue one, which is the dithiocyanate, so maybe it's the second complex, Co(SCN)_2^2+.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The complexes would form as follows:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_1^+ (charge +1)
Co(SCN)_1^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2 (neutral)
Wait no, wait. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So Co(SCN)_1 would be Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_1^+, charge +1. Then Co(SCN)_1^+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)_2, charge 0. Then adding more SCN^- would form Co(SCN)_3^- (charge -1), and then Co(SCN)_4^2- (charge -2). So the four complexes are with 1,2,3,4 ligands.

Wait,
