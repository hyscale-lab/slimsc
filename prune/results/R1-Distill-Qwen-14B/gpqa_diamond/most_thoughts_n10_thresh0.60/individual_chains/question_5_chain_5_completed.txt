Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Okay, let's read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when the system is measured. So, to find the eigenvector, I need to figure out the operator along the direction n first.

Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So, it can be represented as a vector with components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the direction is determined by the angles θ (polar angle) and φ (azimuthal angle), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or 180 degrees. Hmm, but for the general case, maybe we can just express it in terms of θ because φ might not matter here.

The operator P is a vector operator, so the operator along direction n would be P·n, which is P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n becomes P_x * n_x + P_z * n_z.

Let me write that down. So the operator along n is:
P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that n_x is sinθ and n_z is cosθ, so:

P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Now, each P component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a matrix. So let's substitute those in.

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So substituting into P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix part:

sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Add them together:
[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix:
P_n = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write this as an equation. Let |ψ> be a two-component vector [a; b]. Then:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, so the equation becomes:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which simplifies to the matrix equation:

[ cosθ * a + sinθ * b ] = a
[ sinθ * a - cosθ * b ] = b

So the system of equations is:

1. cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2. sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + sinθ b = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
sinθ a - b (cosθ + 1) = 0

Let me write these as:

Equation 1: a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0
Equation 2: a sinθ - b (cosθ + 1) = 0

We can write this as a system:

[ (cosθ -1)   sinθ      ] [a]   = [0]
[  sinθ      -(cosθ +1) ] [b]     [0]

To find non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Wait, but I think there's another approach. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, perhaps it's better to write the equation as (P_n - (ħ/2) I)|ψ> = 0.

Wait, no, because the eigenvalue equation is (P_n - λ I)|ψ> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue. Here, λ is +ħ/2.

So substituting into the matrix equation for λ:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] - [ [λ/(ħ/2), 0], [0, λ/(ħ/2)] ] = 0

Wait, no. Let me think again. The matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix M, where M is [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. So the eigenvalue equation is (M) [a; b] = [a; b]/(ħ/2). But wait, the original equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, so substituting, (ħ/2 M) [a;b] = (ħ/2) [a;b]. Dividing both sides by (ħ/2), we get M [a;b] = [a;b].

So M is the matrix [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]], and we have M [a;b] = [a;b].

So the equation is M - I = 0.

So the matrix (M - I) is:

[ (cosθ - 1), sinθ ]
[ sinθ, (-cosθ -1) ]

The determinant of this should be zero for non-trivial solutions.

So determinant: (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)^2 = 0

Let me compute that.

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = -(cosθ)(cosθ +1) ) + (1)(cosθ +1) )

Wait, perhaps expanding it:

= (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1)
= (cosθ)(-cosθ) + (cosθ)(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*(-1)
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1
= (-cos²θ) + 1

Because -cos² θ +1 is 1 - cos² θ = sin² θ.

Then, subtract (sinθ)^2:

Determinant = sin²θ - (sinθ)^2 = 0.

So yes, determinant is zero, which confirms that the equations have non-trivial solutions.

Now, let's get back to the equations:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a --> equation (1)
sinθ a - cosθ b = b --> equation (2)

From equation (1):

a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0 --> let's call this equation (1a)
From equation (2):

a sinθ - b (cosθ +1) = 0 --> equation (2a)

We can solve equation (1a) for a in terms of b, or vice versa.

From (1a):

a (cosθ -1) = -b sinθ
a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Alternatively, let's factor out the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ) = -2 sin²(θ/2)

And sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So substituting these:

a = [ -b * 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ -2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]
The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels with 2:

a = [ b sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / sin²(θ/2)
Simplify:

a = b [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ) ] = b cot(θ/2)

So a = b cot(θ/2), or a = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] b.

Now, let's express a in terms of b. Let's choose a parameter, say b = sin(θ/2) * k, where k is a normalization constant. Then a = cos(θ/2) * k.

Therefore, the eigenvector components are proportional to [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]. But wait, wait: because a = (cosθ/2)/(sinθ/2) * b, so let's set b = sinθ/2, then a=cosθ/2.

Wait, perhaps I should just let b be a parameter, say let b=1, then a = cot(θ/2). But then, normalization is needed.

Wait, but when we have a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 ), which simplifies to [ b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ ), since denominator is negative.

Wait, let me recompute this part to avoid confusion.

From equation (1a):

a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Which can be written as [b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

Because (cosθ -1 ) = -(1 - cosθ ), so a = [b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

Using the identities:

sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)
1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2)

So substituting:

a = [b * 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ]
Simplify: 2 cancels, sin(θ/2) in numerator and denominator:

a = [b cos(θ/2) ] / [ sin(θ/2) ) ] = b cot(θ/2)

Which brings me back to the same expression: a = b cot(θ/2 )

Now, to write the eigenvector as a vector [a; b], we can express it as:

[ a ]   = [ cot(θ/2) ] * b
[ b ]

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(θ/2 ), 1 ].

Alternatively, factoring out 1/sin(θ/2 ), since cot(θ/2) = cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2 ), so:

[ cos(θ/2 ) / sin(θ/2 ), 1 ]

Which can be written as [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ] multiplied by 1/sin(θ/2 ), but I think it's more straightforward to just write the components as being proportional to cos(θ/2) and sin(θ/2 ), respectively.

Wait, let me see. Let's choose b = sin(θ/2 ), then a = cos(θ/2 ), because:

a = cot(θ/2 ) * b = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2 ) ] * sin(θ/2 ) = cos(θ/2 )

So the vector is [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ].

But wait, let's check with equation (2a):

Equation (2a) is a sinθ - b (cosθ +1 ) = 0.

Substituting a=cos(θ/2 ), b= sin(θ/2 ).

a sinθ = cos(θ/2 ) * 2 sin(θ/2 ) cos(θ/2 ) = 2 cos^2(θ/2) sin(θ/2 )
b (cosθ +1 )= sin(θ/2 ) ( 2 cos^2(θ/2 ) )

So:

2 cos^2 (θ/2 ) sin(θ/2 ) = 2 cos^2 (θ/2 ) sin(θ/2 )

Which holds true. So yes, this satisfies both equations.

Now, the eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ] up to a normalization factor. To normalize, we compute the norm:

|cos(θ/2 )|^2 + |sin(θ/2 )|^2 = cos^2(θ/2 ) + sin^2(θ/2 ) = 1.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2 ), sin(θ/2 ) ].

Wait a minute, but looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this. But wait, the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So perhaps the eigenvector's components are given in terms of theta and phi, but since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so the components are as we found.

Wait, but the options are:

A) (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))
C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))
D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

Wait, but the eigenvector as I found is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ], so option C. However, I'm supposed to choose from the options.

But wait, let me think again. The operator in the problem is a spin-½ operator, I think. Because the matrices given are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is the spin operator, but the question is about the eigenvector for spin +1/2 along an arbitrary direction. So yeah, the spin-up state along any direction n is given by the vector [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] in the computational basis.

Wait, but the options don't include any hbar factors, except option D has hbar terms. Let me check the question again.

Wait, the question says: What are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?

Wait, the eigenvector is a vector in the Hilbert space, and its components are dimensionless. The options A and D include factors with ħ, which is Planck's constant. That can't be right because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are vectors in an abstract space, not physical quantities with units).

So options A and D, which have hbar, are probably incorrect. So the correct option must be between B and C.

Option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). That's exactly what I found. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but that's the spherical harmonics for l=1, m=0, which would be the state for higher angular momentum, but here it's spin-½, so it's different.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ), but why those factors? That would imply a specific orientation of theta where the normalized vector is scaled.

Wait, but why would the eigenvector have factors of sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3)? That might come into play if we're considering a state that's a combination of spin up and down in some basis, but in this problem, the direction is arbitrary, so the eigenvector should be general.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the angle theta is the polar angle of the direction n. So the eigenvector's components are [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ], which matches option C.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented by $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ can be expressed as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ since it lies in the x-z plane.

### Step 1: Construct the operator along $\vec{n}$
The operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
P_n = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
P_n | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle
\]
Let $| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}$. Substituting $P_n$ into the equation:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This gives the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
\]

### Step 3: Solve for $a$ and $b$
Rearranging the first equation:
\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0
\]
Rearranging the second equation:
\[
a \sin\theta - b (\cos\theta + 1) = 0
\]
From the first equation:
\[
a = \frac{-b \sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1}
\]
Using trigonometric identities $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$:
\[
a = \frac{-b (2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2))}{-2\sin^2(\theta/2)} = b \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} = b \cot(\theta/2)
\]
Let $b = \sin(\theta/2)$, then $a = \cos(\theta/2)$. Thus, the eigenvector is:
\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 4: Verify normalization
The eigenvector is already normalized since:
\[
\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect for eigenvectors (dimensionless).  
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ corresponds to spherical harmonics for $l=1$, not spin-1/2.  
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ matches the derived eigenvector.  
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ includes $\hbar$ and incorrect normalization factors.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
