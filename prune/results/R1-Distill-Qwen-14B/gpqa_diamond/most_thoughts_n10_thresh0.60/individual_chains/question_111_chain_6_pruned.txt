Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the major products A and B from the given options. The reactions are:

1. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (with t-BuOK) → A
2. 1-nitropropane + KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O → B

The options are A to D, each giving possible products for A and B. Let me tackle each reaction separately.

Starting with reaction 1. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Hmm. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, but wait: 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl—so positions 2 and 6 are substituted. Let me sketch this.

So the ring has a ketone on carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 has an ethyl group, and carbon 6 has a methyl group. Wait, but wait: cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone. The substituents are on carbons 2, 6, and perhaps the numbering is such that the ketone is on carbon 1. So, it's:

O
||
C1 is the ketone. Then, C2 has an ethyl group, and C6 has a methyl group. Wait, but wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Oh, so position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group? No, wait: no. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the positions are:

- Carbon 1: ketone (O)
- Carbon 2: ethyl group
- Carbon 6: methyl group
Wait, but the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl... So, at position 2, there's an ethyl group
