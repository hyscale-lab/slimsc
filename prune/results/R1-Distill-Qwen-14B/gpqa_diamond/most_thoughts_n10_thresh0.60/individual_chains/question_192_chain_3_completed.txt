Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about an uncharged spherical conductor. Oh right, uncharged means it has no net charge to begin with. It has a small spherical cavity inside it, so it's like a hollow sphere with a little bubble in the middle. The center of this cavity is a distance 's' away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is 'r', and since 'r' is less than 'R', which is the radius of the conductor, the cavity is entirely inside the conductor.

Now, they introduce a small positive charge '+q' somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is 'l', and both L and l are greater than R, meaning P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are four different expressions for E. Hmm. So I need to figure out which one correctly represents the electric field at point P.

Let me think about what I remember from electrostatics, especially conductors and charges inside cavities. So, when a conductor is uncharged but has a cavity with a charge inside, what happens? Oh right, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. Since the conductor is neutral, the charges inside will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, more precisely: when you have a charge inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor was initially neutral, the total charge on the inner surface must be -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. But then, the conductor being neutral, there must be a +q charge induced on the outer surface. Because the inner surface has -q, the outer must have +q to balance it out.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The conductor is neutral, so the total charge is zero. When the +q is inside the cavity, it induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor has no net charge, the outer surface must then have a +q charge, because the inner has -q. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me be careful. The conductor as a whole is neutral. The charge inside the cavity is +q. The inner surface of the conductor will have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the +q charge attracts the electrons in the conductor to the inner surface, leaving the inner surface with a negative charge. Then, since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a positive charge of +q, because the total conductor's charge is zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait no, wait again. The conductor's total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q (because the +q inside the cavity induces that). So the outer surface must have +q to make the total conductor charge zero. Because the conductor can't have a net charge, so the outer surface must balance the inner's -q with its own +q.

So, the outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, when it comes to the electric field outside the conductor at a point P, what matters is the charge distribution on the outer surface. Because for points outside a conductor, the field is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center.

Wait, but is that the case here? Because the charge on the outer surface is +q. So the field outside would be due to that +q as if it were a point charge at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the conductor's outer surface is symmetric? Well, in this problem, the cavity is offset from the center. The center of the cavity is separated by 's' distance from the center of the conductor. So the charge inside the cavity isn't at the center of the conductor. Does that affect the symmetry?

Hmm. Let me think about the implications. For a spherical conductor, if the cavity is centered, then the induced charges would naturally create symmetry. But if the cavity is shifted, such that the charge inside isn't at the center, then the inner surface's charge might not be symmetric.

Wait, but wait. In general, a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has its charge distributed in a way that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. So, the charges in the conductor rearrange themselves to ensure that. So even if the cavity is off-center, the inner surface will have a charge distribution that's induced by the charge in the cavity. But the outer surface must then have a charge that ensures the total is zero.

Wait, but in this problem, the conductor is initially uncharged. So, the inner surface will have -q, and the outer surface will have +q. But because the inner charge is off-center, does that affect the outer surface's distribution?

Wait, if the inner charge is at an offset, the inner surface's charge distribution is asymmetric. But the outer surface, being a conductor, would arrange its charge symmetrically because the only influence is the field from the inner surface. Wait, no, because the inner surface's charge is asymmetric, the outer surface would have to respond.

But wait, wait. The outer surface is a conductor. The charges on the outer surface will arrange themselves in such a way that the electric field inside the conductor (which is the region between the cavity and the outer surface) is zero. So, the charges on the outer surface will arrange to cancel any fields that penetrate from the inner cavity and charge.

Wait, but maybe the field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, regardless of where the inner charge is. Because from a distance, the outer surface's charge distribution, if symmetric, would produce a field as if all charge were at the center.

Wait, but in this problem, the outer surface's charge is +q, regardless of the position of the inner charge. Because the inner surface is -q, so the outer has +q.

Wait, but the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution: if the inner charge is asymmetric, would the outer surface's charge distribution be symmetric? Hmm. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe I should recall the shell theorem. The electric field outside a spherical shell of charge is the same as if all the charge were at the center. But for that to hold, the charge distribution must be spherically symmetric.

In this problem, the outer surface is a conductor, so the charge on it might not be spherically symmetric if the inner charge is off-center. But wait, wait a second. The conductor's outer surface is a sphere, right? So the conductor itself is a sphere, and the outer surface is spherical. So even if the inner charge is off-center, the outer surface's charge must arrange itself in a way that maintains the conductor's potential. But the conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface's charge should be uniformly distributed, regardless of the inner charge's position.

Wait, no. That's only if the inner charge is a point charge and the conductor is a perfect sphere. Hmm. I think that the presence of an off-center charge in the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an asymmetric charge distribution, but the outer surface would still be symmetric because the conductor is spherical. Let me think: the electric field inside the conductor must be zero, so the outer surface's charge must arrange in such a way that any external fields are canceled, except for the field due to the outer charge.

Wait, perhaps the outer surface's charge is at the same potential everywhere, and since the conductor is spherical, the charge distribution on the outer surface is uniform. Because the conductor is a sphere, any excess charge will distribute itself uniformly, regardless of the inner charge distribution.

Ah, right! The conductor is a sphere, so the outer surface must have a uniform charge distribution because any non-uniform distribution would cause electric fields within the conductor, which is not allowed. So the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, making the field outside the conductor as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait. There's an important point here. The conductor's outer surface has a total charge of +q. So, the electric field outside the conductor is the same as that of a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.

But wait, the point P is located at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P is as if the charge +q is at the center, and the field is radial at that point.

Wait, but the cavity is not centered. The center of the cavity is a distance 's' from the center of the conductor. So, the charge '+q' is inside the cavity, which is shifted away from the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed because the conductor is a sphere. So when we calculate the electric field outside the conductor, it's just as if the charge is at the center. So the position of the inner charge doesn't affect the external field.

Wait, but that can't be right because the inner charge is inside the conductor. Wait, the conductor's outer surface's charge is +q, so when you're outside, it's as if you have a point charge +q at the center. So the electric field at P would just depend on L, the distance from the center to P.

So, the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit vector pointing from the center to P. So the magnitude would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but why are the other options there? Let me think if I missed something. Option A and C involve (l ± s cosθ) squared. That suggests some interaction based on the positions of P relative to the cavity's center. But since the outer surface's charge is symmetric, the internal arrangement shouldn't affect the external field.

Wait, but another thought: the point P is outside the conductor. The conductor's outer radius is R, and P is at a distance L > R. The conductor's charge is +q, so the field at P is due to that +q, located at the center. So it doesn't matter where the inner charge is, as the outer field is only due to the outer charge.

So, the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The spherical conductor is initially uncharged, with a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$. A small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity. This induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor, leaving a net charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor (since the conductor as a whole remains neutral).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For points outside a spherical conductor, the electric field depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere (by the shell theorem). The outer surface of the conductor has a uniform charge distribution of $+q$, regardless of the position of the charge inside the cavity. This is because the conductor is spherical, ensuring that the charge on the outer surface distributes uniformly to maintain electrostatic equilibrium.

3. **Field at Point $P$**:  
   The point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is therefore determined by the charge $+q$ on the outer surface, as if it were a point charge located at the center of the conductor. The magnitude of the electric field is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which suggests a dependence on the relative positions of $P$, the cavity's center, and the conductor's center. This is incorrect because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface, not on the internal arrangement of charges.  
   - **Option B**: Matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor, $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, and is correct.  
   - **Option C**: Involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is similarly incorrect for the same reason as Option A.  
   - **Option D**: Suggests the electric field depends only on $l$, the distance from $P$ to the cavity's center. This is incorrect because the field outside the conductor depends on the distance $L$ from $P$ to the conductor's center, not $l$.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
