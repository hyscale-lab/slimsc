Okay, so I have this problem about planets and the probability of them transiting. Hmm, I remember that transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh wait, but in this case, the planets are Earth-like, so maybe their sizes are similar? Or does it matter? Let me think.

The question says both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things because eccentricity isn't a factor here.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So same size, but different masses. I wonder how that affects the probability.

I think the transit probability formula is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else. Wait, no, wait. Or is it the ratio of the planet's orbital distance or something? Oh, right, the probability of a transit is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 divided by (a_planet / R_star)^2, or maybe... Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius squared, and the inclination. Wait, no, that's not the right approach.

Wait, the probability of transit is given by the formula: (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - e^2)) ), but since e is
