Okay, so I've got this question about the transit method for detecting exoplanets. Hmm. Let me think through this.

So the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars have different masses: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting.

Wait, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, but also the orbital distance. Oh right, the formula I think is P = (R_star) / (a * (1 + sqrt(M_planet/(M_star))))) ) squared or something? Or wait, maybe I should think about the transit probability formula.

Oh wait, the probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 * (1/(1 + (M_star/M_planet)^0.5))^2? No, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, I recall that the transit probability is given by the formula: P â‰ˆ (R*/a)^2, but that's a simplification under certain assumptions. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, the geometric probability of a planet transiting
