Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think about what I remember. The radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion.

So the question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key data is the periodic shifts in their spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, I remember that the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula for the Doppler effect in terms of velocity is something like (Δλ/λ) = v/c, where Δλ is the shift, λ is the original wavelength, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. Since both shifts are given for the same spectral line (same λ), the ratio of the velocities would be the same as the ratio of the shifts. Oh right, because if λ is the same, then Δλ1/Δλ2 = v1/v2.

So for planet #1, the shift is 5, and planet #2 is 7. So v1 is 5, v2 is7? Wait no, wait. Because the spectral line shifts depend on the star's velocity towards or away from us. If planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift and planet #2 causes a 7, that means the stars are moving at v1=5 and v2=7? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to the Doppler shift. So K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. So K₁ is 5 and K₂ is7 milliangstroms? Or wait, no, the shift is given in milliangstroms. Wait, the units of K are in velocity, right? Because the shift is a velocity. So K is in m/s. But in this question, the shifts are given as 5 and7 milliangstroms. So perhaps we need to compute the velocity from the shift.

Wait wait, let me think about the formula again. The Doppler
