Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things might be a bit different because of those relativistic effects like gamma factors.

The question gives a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, so it's obeying Hooke's law. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's option C. But since it's relativistic, that can't be the case, because in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in the system would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in this case, the oscillator's total energy would come from the potential energy at maximum displacement. So at x = A, all energy is potential, and at x=0, all is kinetic.

So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², right? But wait,
