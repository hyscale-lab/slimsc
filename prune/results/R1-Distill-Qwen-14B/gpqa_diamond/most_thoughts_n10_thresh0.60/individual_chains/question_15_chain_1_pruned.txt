Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their stars. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is one way to detect planets, like how Kepler does it. But wait, this question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one first.

The question says that both planets have the same mass, which is interesting. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—only one-third of Planet_2's period. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period usually means a smaller orbit, right?

The stars: Planet_1's host star is more massive, twice as much as Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit confusing. How can a more massive star have the same radius? Maybe because it's not as evolved yet? Oh, the question says Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. So, more evolved stars might expand, but in this case, they have the same size.

I need to find the transit probability for each planet. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orientation of the orbit. The formula, if I recall correctly, is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else... Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital radius to the star's radius, but actually, the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, where a is the semi-major axis. Or wait,
