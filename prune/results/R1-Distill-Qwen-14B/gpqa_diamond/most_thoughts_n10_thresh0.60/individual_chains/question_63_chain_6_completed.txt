Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about the quantum rotation-vibration model or the non-rigid rotor model. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that a diatomic molecule, made of elements X and Y, is in its fundamental state. We need to find the momentum of a photon that's absorbed so the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state.

The given data: mass of X is 20 amu, Y is 2 amu. Bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, amu—atomic mass units. I remember that 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So I'll need to convert the masses into kilograms. Right, because in physics equations, mass is in kg.

So the molecule's moment of inertia comes into play here. For a diatomic, the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. Oh, right, the reduced mass is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY). So I'll compute that first.

Let me compute the masses in kg. Mx = 20 amu * 1.66e-27 kg/amu = 3.32e-26 kg. My = 2 amu * same factor, so 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1.66e-27 kg? Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Let me think again. Wait, no, because each mass is already in kg. Wait, no, I think I should compute mX and mY first.

Wait, no, the formula is μ = (mX * mY) / (mX + mY). So mX is 20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg. mY is 2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.32e-26 kg * 3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 kg + 3.32e-27 kg). Let me compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = let's calculate 3.32^2 is about 11.02, and exponents are 10^(-26-27)=1e-53. So 11.02e-53 kg².

Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg. So μ is (11.02e-53) / (3.652e-26) = let's see. 11.02 / 3.652 is approximately 3. So 3e-27 kg. Because 1e-53 divided by 1e-26 is 1e-27. So μ is about 3e-27 kg.

Wait, let me do the exact calculation. 3.32 *3.32 = 11.0224. 3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 = 11.0224e-53. Denominator: 3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27 = 3.32e-26 + 0.332e-26 = 3.652e-26 kg.

So μ = (11.0224e-53) / (3.652e-26) = (11.0224 / 3.652) * 1e-27. 11.0224 / 3.652 is about 3.02. So μ ≈ 3.02e-27 kg.

Next, the moment of inertia I is μ R². R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So R squared is (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.02e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg m².

Now, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions. But wait, the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for vibration is the ground state (n=0), and for rotation is the lowest rotational state (probably J=0). Or wait, no—wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the states are a combination of rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). 

But the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So it's the next higher energy state. That might be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized, but I think the energy levels for rotation and vibration are considered separately. Or perhaps the model treats them as coupled, but I'm a bit fuzzy.

Wait, the question is about absorbing a photon. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule's energy increases. The energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the current state and the next higher state.

But what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? It would be the state that's just one step higher than the current state in the energy hierarchy. So, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible. To find the next state, which is the first excited state. That would be the next higher energy level, which could be either a higher vibrational state (n=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). Since vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than rotational ones (vibrational has higher energy spacing), perhaps the first excited state is the next vibrational level.

But wait, the problem says the model is the non-rigid rotor model, which suggests that both rotation and vibration are considered. So maybe the energy levels are a combination of both. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental state is the state with the lowest vibrational and rotational energy. So the next state would be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think refers to the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be either n=1, J=0 or n=0, J=1. But which transition requires less energy?

The energy of the photon would have to match the energy difference between the initial and final states.

So, I need to calculate the energy difference for the possible transitions and see which one is lower, then choose that.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the smallest possible energy increase. So the photon would have to provide the energy corresponding to the smallest possible transition.

So let's compute the vibrational energy quantum and the rotational energy quantum.

The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, so the fundamental state is n=0, E_vib = (0 + 1/2) h w. The first excited vibrational state would be n=1, E_vib = (1 + 1/2) h w. So the energy difference for a vibrational transition (from n=0 to n=1) is h w.

For the rotational energy levels, the formula is E_rot = B (J (J+1)), where B is the rotational constant. B is h / (8 π² I c), but I think in some derivations, it's expressed as B = ħ²/(2I), but I need to get the correct expression.

Wait, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_rot = (J (J + 1)) (h²/(8 I)), where I is the moment of inertia. So for J=0, E_rot is 0. For J=1, E_rot is (1*2) * (h²/(8 I)) = 2 h²/(8 I) = h²/(4 I).

So the energy difference for a rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is h²/(4 I).

Now, comparing the two possible transitions: vibrational transition requires energy h w, and the rotational requires h²/(4 I).

Which is smaller? Let's compute both.

Given that w is 4e14 rad/s. Let's compute h w.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Now, compute h²/(4 I). h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s². Divide by 4 I: 4 * 1.208e-46 kg m² = 4.832e-46 kg m².

So h²/(4 I) = 4.39e-67 / (4.832e-46) = approx (4.39 /4.832) * 1e-21. Let's compute 4.39 /4.832 ≈ 0.908. So 0.908e-21 J, which is 9.08e-22 J.

Comparing the two: vibrational is 2.65e-19 J, rotational is 9.08e-22 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy.

Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first rotational state (J=1), because that transition requires a lower energy photon.

So the photon's energy must be equal to the rotational energy difference: h²/(4 I).

Wait, wait, but wait a minute. The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest state. So the initial state is (n=0, J=0). The next possible state is (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0). Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon would have to provide that. So the photon's energy is h²/(4 I).

But the question is about momentum, not energy. So we need to relate the energy of the photon to its momentum.

The energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E / c.

So first, compute E_rot = h²/(4 I). Let me plug in the numbers.

h = 6.626e-34 J s
I = 1.208e-46 kg m²

E_rot = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 * 1.208e-46)

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 4 * 1.208e-46 = 4.832e-46.

So E_rot = 4.39e-67 / 4.832e-46 ≈ (4.39 /4.832) * 1e-21 J.

4.39 /4.832 ≈ 0.908, so E_rot ≈ 9.08e-22 J.

Then, p = E_rot / c. c is 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.08e-22 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.027e-30 kg m/s.

Wait, but that's 3.027e-30 kg m/s. Hmm. Let's convert that to N s because the options are in N s.

Wait, 1 N s is 1 kg m/s. So 3.027e-30 kg m/s = 3.027e-30 N s.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 Ns → bigger than our value.

Option B: 2.3e-27→ way bigger.

Option C:1.1e-27 → bigger.

Option D:1.4e-28→ also bigger than our 3e-30.

Wait, that's a problem. Because none of the options match 3e-30. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the rotational energy. Let me double-check.

The rotational energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_rot = (J (J + 1)) * (h²/(8 I)).

So for J=0, E_rot = 0.

J=1: E_rot = 2*(h²/(8 I)) = (h²/(4 I)).

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot.

Let me recompute E_rot.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 (J·s)^2.

I = 1.208e-46 kg·m²

So E_rot = (4.39e-67) / (4 * 1.208e-46) = 4.39e-67 / 4.832e-46 = 4.39/(4.832) * 1e-21.

Wait, 4.39e-67 / 4.832e-46 is (4.39/4.832) * (1e-67 / 1e-46) )= (approx 0.908) * 1e-21 → 9.08e-22 J. So that's correct.

Then, p = E_rot / c = 9.08e-22 / 3e8 = 3.027e-30 kg m/s → 3.027e-30 N s.

Looking at the options, none of them match. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check the moment of inertia calculation again.

I = μ R².

μ is (mX * mY)/(mX + mY).

mX = 20 amu → 20 * 1.66e-27 kg = 3.32e-26 kg.

mY = 2 amu → 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 + 3.32e-27) → denominator is 3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 * 1e-53 → 11.022 * 1e-53 → 1.1022e-52.

So μ = 1.1022e-52 / 3.652e-26 → approx 3.02e-27 kg. That's correct.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m. So R² = 4e-20 m².

I = μ R² = 3.02e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.208e-46 kg m². Correct.

Hmm. So the calculations seem right. But the options don't match. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about whether the transition is rotational or vibrational.

Wait, perhaps the model is the non-rigid rotor, which might imply that the vibrational energy is being considered, but the rotational is treated as a rigid rotor. Or maybe I'm mixing up the models.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the molecule transitioning from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (n=1, J=0). That would be a vibrational transition, which requires more energy, but if that's the case, the photon's energy would be higher.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the smallest energy increase. So, if the rotational transition requires less energy, that's the next state.

But according to our calculations, the rotational transition's photon has momentum around 3e-30 N s, but the options are much bigger.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the change in the rotational state, but perhaps the model is the rigid rotor, and for the rigid rotor, the energy levels are quantized as E_rot = (J (J + 1)) B, where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, B is given by B = h/(8 π² I). Let me compute B.

B = h/(8 π² I) = 6.626e-34 / (8 * (π²) * 1.208e-46 )

Compute denominator: 8 * π² ≈ 8 *9.8696 ≈ 78.957.

So 78.957 * 1.208e-46 ≈ 78.957 * 1.208 ≈ 95.33e-46 → 9.533e-45.

So B ≈ 6.626e-34 / 9.533e-45 → approx 6.626 /9.533 ≈ 0.695 → 0.695e9 → 6.95e8 1/s.

So B ≈ 6.95e8 s^-1.

Then, the energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1).

From J=0 to J=1, E_rot_diff = B (2 - 0) = 2 B.

So E_rot_diff = 2 *6.95e8 * h.

Wait, no, no. Wait, E_rot is B J (J+1), but B is in 1/s, so E_rot is in Joules? Wait, no. E_rot = B * J (J+1) * h?

Wait, no, let's clarify. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = (J (J +1)) * (h²/(8 I)).

Which is the same as E_rot = (J(J+1)) * B, where B = h²/(8 I).

Wait, in that case, B is in units of J.

So E_rot_diff is 2 B, since J=1: E_rot = 2 B.

So E_rot_diff = 2 B = 2 * h²/(8 I) )= h²/(4 I), which is what I computed earlier.

So that part checks out.

Hmm, but the photon's momentum is 3e-30 N s, but the options are higher. So maybe I messed up something else.

Wait, another possibility: the question is about the photon's angular momentum. But no, the question is about the momentum, which is linear momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered both rotational and vibrational transitions and added their energies. But that doesn't make sense because the molecule can only transition to one next state.

Wait, maybe I confused the energy for the photon. Oh wait, the photon's energy is E = h f = p c. So p = E/c.

Wait, but another approach: The photon's energy must match the energy needed for the transition, which is the difference between the states.

So, if the molecule is in the (n=0, J=0) state, the next possible states are (n=0, J=1) and (n=1, J=0). If the required energy for (n=0, J=1) is less than that for (n=1, J=0), then the photon's energy is the rotational difference.

So let's compute both energies.

E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

E_rot = h²/(4 I) ≈9.08e-22 J, as before.

So the photon's energy is 9.08e-22 J, which converts to p = E/c = 9.08e-22 /3e8 = 3.03e-30 kg m/s → 3.03e-30 N s.

But the options are all larger. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the model being non-rigid considers both rotation and vibration in a way that the transition is a combination.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the non-rigid rotor model accounts for the bond length changing during vibration, but perhaps the question is about a transition that changes both rotation and vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition that involves a change in both vibrational and rotational states, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is the lowest vibrational state and the lowest rotational state, and the next state is the first possible higher state, regardless of which mode it's in.

But in that case, the photon's energy would be the minimum of the two possible transitions. So the photon's energy would be the rotational one, as it's lower.

But again, that gives p =3e-30 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait another thought: Did I compute the reduced mass correctly?

Because the bond length R is given, but perhaps the moment of inertia uses the actual masses, not the reduced mass. No, wait, the moment of inertia for a diatomic is indeed μ R², so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the model is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, but in a non-rigid rotor, the vibration changes the bond length, so perhaps the moment of inertia varies with vibration.

But that complicates things because the moment of inertia isn't constant. However, in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length changes with vibration, so the moment of inertia isn't fixed. But for the purpose of calculating the energy levels, perhaps we use an effective reduced mass or an average bond length.

Hmm, maybe I should think of the problem differently. Perhaps the question is referring to the vibration-rotation coupling, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy transition and compare it to the rotational.

Because if the photon's energy is higher than the rotational but lower than the vibrational, then the rotational transition would be the next possible state. But our earlier calculation shows that the rotational transition requires less energy, so that would be the next state.

But since the options don't have the value I calculated, perhaps I made a mistake in some step.

Wait, let's compute the moment of inertia again.

mX =20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

mY=2 amu=3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 )

Let me compute denominator: 3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 =3.32e-26 +0.332e-26=3.652e-26 kg.

Numerator: 3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 = (3.32)^2 *1e-53 =11.0224e-53 =1.10224e-52 kg².

So μ = 1.10224e-52 /3.652e-26 = (1.10224/3.652) *1e-26 → approximately 0.302 *1e-26 =3.02e-27 kg.

Wait, R is 2 angstroms =2e-10 meters.

I = μ R² =3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.02e-27 *4e-20 = 1.208e-46 kg m².

That's correct.

So, h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

E_rot = h²/(4 I) =4.39e-67 / (4*1.208e-46) =4.39e-67 /4.832e-46 = approx 9.08e-22 J.

p =9.08e-22 /3e8 =3.027e-30 N s.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the model expects the photon to cause a vibrational transition, but that requires more energy.

Wait, let me compute the vibrational photon momentum.

E_vib =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p =E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 N s.

Looking at options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. 8.8e-28 is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I messed up the energy levels. Perhaps the fundamental state is (n=0, J=0), and the next state is (n=0, J=1), but that's a rotational transition, requiring 9e-22 J.

Wait, but none of the options are near 3e-30. So perhaps the problem considers the photon causing a change in both vibrational and rotational states. But that would be a combination of both, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and a 3D oscillator, but that's probably not it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transition that involves both vibrational and rotational changes, but perhaps the photon's energy is the sum of the first vibrational and first rotational steps. No, that would be higher than either, which doesn't make sense for the lowest possible energy.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_rot. Let me recompute E_rot.

E_rot = (J=1) E_rot - (J=0) E_rot. J=0 has E=0. So E_rot_diff is E_rot for J=1.

E_rot for J=1 is (1*(1+1)) * h²/(8 I) ) = 2 * h²/(8 I) )= h²/(4 I).

Yes, correct. So E_rot_diff is h²/(4 I) =9.08e-22 J.

Wait, maybe I should express that as (h^2)/(4 I) in terms of the given variables.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. What is the angular frequency of the rotational transition? Well, for a rotational transition, the selection rule is ΔJ=±2, but wait, no, in rotational transitions, ΔJ=±1. Wait, for rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the energy difference between J and J+1 is B ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) = B (2J+2).

But for the transition from J=0 to J=1, ΔE = 2B.

Wait, what's B? B is h/(8 π² I).

So, B =6.626e-34 / (8 π² * 1.208e-46).

Compute denominator: 8 * π² is approx 78.96.

78.96 *1.208e-46 ≈ 78.96 *1.208e-46 = 95.3e-46 → 9.53e-45.

So B ≈6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 = approx 6.95e8 s^-1.

So, ΔE_rot =2 * B * h.

Wait, no. Because E_rot for J=1 is 2B, and for J=0 it's zero. So the energy difference is 2B * h?

Wait, no, no. Wait, B is in s^-1, so E_rot = B * J (J+1) * h. Because E_rot = (h²/(8 I)) J (J+1). So if B is h²/(8 I), so E_rot = B J (J+1) * h? No, because B is h²/(8 I), which has units of J·s²? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about units. I is in kg m². h is J·s. So h²/(8 I) has units (J² s²)/(kg m²) ) = ( (kg² m²/s² * s²) ) / (kg m²) ) ) = kg m²/s² → J.

So B is in J.

So E_rot_diff is 2B → 2 * (h²/(8 I)) )= h²/(4 I), which is correct.

Therefore, the photon's momentum is E_rot_diff / c = (h²/(4 I)) / c.

So, perhaps I should compute this again.

h =6.626e-34 J·s

I =1.208e-46 kg m²

c=3e8 m/s.

So E_rot_diff = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 *1.208e-46) → let's compute:

Numerator:6.626e-34^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator:4 *1.208e-46 =4.832e-46 kg m².

So E_rot_diff=4.39e-67 /4.832e-46 = (4.39/4.832) *1e-21 J → approximately 0.908e-21 J →9.08e-22 J.

p= E_rot_diff /c =9.08e-22 /3e8=3.027e-30 kg m/s → 3.027e-30 N s.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the question is about the next possible state, which could be n=1, regardless of J.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and a 3D oscillator. No, it's diatomic, so 2D rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy.

Wait, let me compute the ratio of the energies.

E_vib =2.65e-19 J.

E_rot =9.08e-22 J.

So E_rot is about 0.034% of E_vib. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy.

But the options don't have anything near 3e-30. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the model is being considered as a non-rigid rotor, which is treated as a 3D rotor, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the molecule is modeled as a harmonic oscillator plus a non-rigid rotor, and the next state is the first overtone of vibration, but that would be even higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the next state is a higher rotational state, but I'm considering the wrong J value.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is in the (n=0, J=0) state. The next state is (n=0, J=1). The photon's energy is 9.08e-22 J. But if none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the reduced mass.

mX =20 amu →20 *1.66e-27 =3.32e-26 kg.

mY =2 amu →3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 kg *3.32e-27 kg) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 kg) → (1.102e-52) / (3.652e-26) →3.02e-27 kg.

I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the model uses the bond length R as the effective distance for the vibrational state, but I don't think that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy first.

The vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w.

The fundamental state is n=0: E_vib = (0.5) h w= 0.5 *6.626e-34 *4e14 = 1.325e-19 J.

The first excited vibrational state is n=1: E_vib= (1.5) h w= 1.9875e-19 J.

The energy difference is ΔE_vib =1.9875e-19 -1.325e-19=6.625e-20 J.

So the photon's energy would be 6.625e-20 J, which is E=pc → p= E/c=6.625e-20 /3e8=2.208e-28 kg m/s →2.208e-28 N s.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option B is2.3e-27, option D is1.4e-28. So 2.2e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). But 2.2e-28 isn't exactly any of them. Hmm.

Wait, earlier calculation for rotational transition gives 3e-30, which is smaller than all options. But if the question is about the next state being a vibrational state, then the photon's momentum would be 2.2e-28 N s, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28).

But why the discrepancy? Let me double-check the calculation.

E_vib for n=0 to n=1: ΔE = h w (1) → because E = (n +1/2) h w. So ΔE = h w (n=1 -n=0) ) = ( (3/2 h w) - (1/2 h w) ) ) = h w. So ΔE = 6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

Wait, this is different from my earlier calculation where I thought ΔE was 6.625e-20 J. Wait, wait, what was that about?

Ah, I see. I made a mistake earlier. When n=0, E= (0.5) h w. When n=1, E= (1.5) h w. So ΔE is (1.5 -0.5) h w = h w → 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So earlier I think I miscalculated. So the energy difference for the vibrational transition is 2.65e-19 J, not 6.6e-20. So p = 2.65e-19 /3e8= 8.83e-28 kg m/s →8.83e-28 N s.

But none of the options match that either. So perhaps the question is not about a vibrational transition but a rotational one.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state in the energy hierarchy. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest possible. The next state could be the next higher in energy, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The one with lower energy delta is the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy is the rotational energy delta. But according to our earlier calculations, that's 9e-22 J, which gives p=3e-30 N s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering the photon causing a transition that includes both a rotational and a vibrational change. But that would require a higher energy, which doesn't fit the "lowest possible energy" condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, and the next state is a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation. Let me recheck.

mX =20 amu =20 *1.66e-27 kg =3.32e-26 kg.

mY=2 amu = 3.32e-27 kg.

μ = (3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 ) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 ) → (1.102e-52) / (3.652e-26) →3.02e-27 kg.

I think that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculated value isn't among the options. So perhaps the correct approach is to think about the photon's momentum in terms of the vibrational energy.

Wait, given the options, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1.9e-28) or option D (1.4e-28). But based on our earlier calculation, the vibrational transition gives p=8.83e-28, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct transition is the rotational one, but the calculation isn't matching the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, another approach: Compute the rotational energy in terms of the given w and the moment of inertia.

Wait, the rotational energy is E_rot = (1/2) I ω², but that's for classical rotation. In quantum mechanics, it's quantized, so perhaps that approach doesn't apply. But perhaps the frequency of the rotational transition can be found using the rotational constant B.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum in the vibration. The energy of the photon is E = h w, so p = E/c.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N s.

But the options are A)1.9e-28, B)2.3e-27, C)1.1e-27, D)1.4e-28.

8.83e-28 is not listed. The closest option is A, which is about half of that.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition from J=0 to J=2, which would be a larger rotational transition. But that would require more energy, which doesn't fit the 'lowest possible energy' condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is different. Maybe the problem is actually asking for the photon to cause a transition in the vibration only, but I'm not sure why the calculated value isn't matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the given data is for the rotational constant, but I'm not using it. Wait, the given data includes the angular frequency of vibration w=4e14 rad/s.

Ah, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition. So photon's energy is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, and p=8.83e-28 N s. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's wavelength instead, but the question is about momentum.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a three-dimensional rotor, but it's diatomic, so two-dimensional.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me compute μ R² again.

μ =3.02e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

I=μ R²=3.02e-27 * (2e-10)^2=3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46 kg m². Correct.

So, I think the calculation is correct. But the options don't match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: What if the question is about the photon causing the molecule to transition from the ground state (n=0, J=0) to the next state, which is (n=1, J=0). That would be a vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is h w, which is 2.65e-19 J, and p=8.83e-28 N s.

But again, it's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum causing a transition in the rotational state, but the calculation results in a value not in the options. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any miscalculations in the initial steps.

Let me compute μ again:

mX=20 amu =3.32e-26 kg.

mY=2 amu=3.32e-27 kg.

μ= (3.32e-26 * 3.32e-27) / (3.32e-26 +3.32e-27 )

Numerator:3.32e-26 *3.32e-27 =3.32 *3.32=11.0224 → 11.0224e-53.

Denominator:3.32e-26 +3.32e-27=3.32e-26 +0.332e-26=3.652e-26.

μ=11.0224e-53 /3.652e-26 = (11.0224/3.652) *1e-27 →3.02e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

I=3.02e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2=3.02e-27 *4e-20=1.208e-46 kg m².

Correct.

Thus, E_rot= (6.626e-34)^2/(4 *1.208e-46 )=9.08e-22 J.

p=9.08e-22 /3e8 =3.03e-30 N s.

None of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a three-dimensional rotor, so the moment of inertia is different. For a diatomic, it's a 2D rotor, but in 3D, I think the moment of inertia is different. Wait, no, for a diatomic molecule, the moment of inertia is the same regardless of the rotation axis, because it's symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational energy. Rotational energy is much smaller, so the next state would be a vibrational transition.

But the calculated p=8.83e-28 N s is not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me recompute.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c=2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 N s.

Again, not an option. So maybe the correct approach is to compute the photon's momentum for the rotational transition, which is 3.03e-30 N s, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the rotational energy. Maybe it's E_rot = (J (J+1)) * h/(8 π² I). Let me compute B again.

B= h/(8 π² I)=6.626e-34/(8 * (9.8696) *1.208e-46 )

Compute denominator:8 *9.8696≈78.957.

78.957 *1.208e-46 ≈95.3e-46=9.53e-45.

B=6.626e-34 /9.53e-45 ≈6.95e8 s^-1.

So E_rot_diff =2 B * h.

Wait, no. Because E_rot = B J (J+1) * h? Or E_rot = B J (J+1) * (h/2π)?

Wait, perhaps the energy is E_rot = (h/(2 π)) * B * J (J+1).

So for J=1, E_rot= h/(2 π) * B *2.

So E_rot_diff = h/(2 π) * 2 B = h B / π.

With B=6.95e8 s^-1.

So E_rot_diff= (6.626e-34 J s) *6.95e8 s^-1 / π.

Compute that: (6.626e-34 *6.95e8 ) /3.1416.

6.626e-34 *6.95e8≈4.594e-25.

Divide by 3.1416:≈1.46e-25 J.

So p = E/c =1.46e-25 /3e8 =4.867e-34 N s. Still way too small.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I'm missing something in the approach. Perhaps the problem is about the rotational energy, but the given options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the photon causing a transition where the molecule changes from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which would require a photon with energy h w, leading to p=8.83e-28 N s. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the vibrational energy in terms of the bond's potential energy. But I don't think that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the angular momentum instead of linear momentum. Because in rotational transitions, the photon's angular momentum (which is related to its linear momentum) must match the change in the molecule's angular momentum. But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Wait, the angular momentum of the photon is L = r × p. But for a diatomic, the transition is quantized in terms of J, so the photon must carry away or provide the necessary angular momentum. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation of the linear momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to be done using the rotational energy but in a different way. Let me think: The rotational energy E_rot = (1/2) I ω², but in quantum terms, it's quantized.

Wait, the angular frequency of vibration is given as w=4e14 rad/s. Could that be used in the rotational calculation? Probably not directly.

Another thought: Maybe the problem is about the photon's frequency corresponding to the rotational energy difference. So, the frequency f = E_rot_diff / h.

E_rot_diff=9.08e-22 J.

f=9.08e-22 /6.626e-34 ≈1.37e12 Hz.

But how does that help with the momentum?

Hmm.

I'm running out of ideas. Given the time I've spent, I think I should go with the calculation that the momentum is 3.03e-30 N s, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake, and the correct answer is option A (1.9e-28), which is close to the vibrational transition's 8.8e-28. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent in the calculation. Let me recompute the rotational energy.

E_rot = h²/(4 I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (4 *1.208e-46 )

Compute numerator:6.626e-34^2=4.39e-67.

Denominator:4 *1.208e-46=4.832e-46.

So E_rot=4.39e-67 /4.832e-46 = (4.39/4.832) * 1e-21 →0.908e-21=9.08e-22 J.

p=9.08e-22 /3e8=3.027e-30 kg m/s.

So, yeah, I think the answer isn't among the options. But perhaps the intended approach was to calculate the vibrational transition, giving p=8.83e-28, which is close to option A (1.9e-28) or option D (1.4e-28). But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the rotational energy difference in terms of the given variables without plugging in the numbers. Let me see:

p = (h²/(4 I c)) = ( (6.626e-34)^2 ) / (4 *1.208e-46 *3e8 )

Compute denominator:4 *1.208e-46 *3e8 =4*3.624e-38=1.4496e-37.

Numerator:4.39e-67.

So p=4.39e-67 /1.4496e-37 =3.03e-30 kg m/s.

Same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed, but since that's not possible, perhaps the intended approach was to compute the vibrational transition, leading to option A or D. But without knowing, I'm unsure.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition the diatomic molecule from its fundamental state to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule's energy levels are influenced by both rotational and vibrational contributions, and the goal is to identify the transition with the smallest energy difference.

### Key Information and Calculations:

1. **Masses of Atoms**:
   - \( m_X = 20 \, \text{amu} = 20 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} = 3.32 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg} \)
   - \( m_Y = 2 \, \text{amu} = 2 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} = 3.32 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)

2. **Reduced Mass**:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{m_X \cdot m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \frac{(3.32 \times 10^{-26}) \cdot (3.32 \times 10^{-27})}{(3.32 \times 10^{-26}) + (3.32 \times 10^{-27})} = 3.02 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \mu R^2 = (3.02 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.208 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2
   \]

4. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = (n + \frac{1}{2}) h \omega
   \]
   For the transition from \( n = 0 \) to \( n = 1 \), the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]

5. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   The rotational energy levels for a rigid rotor are:
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{8 I} J (J + 1)
   \]
   For the transition from \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \), the energy difference is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{h^2}{4 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{4 \cdot (1.208 \times 10^{-46})} = 9.08 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{J}
   \]
   The corresponding photon momentum is:
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.08 \times 10^{-22}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.03 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s}
   \]

6. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational transition requires significantly more energy (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) compared to the rotational transition (\( 3.03 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)).
   - Since the question asks for the transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the correct choice.

### Conclusion:
The calculated momentum for the rotational transition (\( 3.03 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, based on the vibrational transition calculation (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)), the closest option is **A) \( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{s} \)**.

ANSWER: A
