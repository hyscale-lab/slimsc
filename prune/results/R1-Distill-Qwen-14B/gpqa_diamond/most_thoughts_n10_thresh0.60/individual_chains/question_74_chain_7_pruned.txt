Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about the decay of a single atom. They've given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. But so far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The options are A to D, with percentages.

Hmm. Right, radioactive decay is a Poisson process, which means the probability of decay is independent of time. So the decay process doesn't have memory; the fact that it hasn't decayed for 50 minutes doesn't change its probability in the future. Wait, but wait, the question says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, maybe I should model this with the decay constant and find the probability over a certain time.

Wait, but the 32% is the probability of decay within 100 minutes. So for a single atom, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The formula for the probability of decay is P(t) = 1 - e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant and t is time.

But wait, in that case, if P(100) = 0.32, then 0.32 = 1 - e^(-位*100). So e^(-100位) = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides: -
