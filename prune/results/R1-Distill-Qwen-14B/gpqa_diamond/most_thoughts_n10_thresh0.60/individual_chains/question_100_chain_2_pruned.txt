Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the compound starts as A, which is C3H6. I remember that the molecular formula C3H6 can be for propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane. But given the reactions, I think it's more likely propene because the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Oh wait, wait, bromination in CCl4 is probably an addition reaction. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add bromine, right? Because alkenes react with Br2 in CCl4 via addition.

So compound A is propene, C3H6. Then, when it undergoes bromination in CCl4, it becomes compound B. Propene adding Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. So B would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Wait, no, wait. Propene structure is CH2=CHCH3. When Br2 adds across the double bond, it would add to each end. So the product would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, it's CH2=CHCH3, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane
