Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts in some way.

Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4, and others are ignored. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a formula involving the phase shifts. The formula I recall is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (something with the phase shifts and the Legendre polynomials).

Wait, but more specifically, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the incident direction (θ=0) might depend only on the delta_0 phase shift. Because when θ is 0, the Legendre polynomial P_0^0(cosθ) is 1, and other terms might vanish or contribute less. Or wait, actually, the scattering amplitude in the forward direction (θ=0) is given by f(0) = (1/(2ik)) (δ_0 + ... sum of terms involving higher delta's? Or maybe only δ0 contributes because for θ=0, the other terms might not have a non-zero contribution.

Wait, I think the general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) ) )

So the imaginary part of f(θ) would involve the imaginary parts of each term. For the forward direction, θ=0, cosθ=1. So P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. Wait, no, Legendre polynomials at 1 are 1 for all l? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, P_0(x)=1, P_1(x)=x, so P_1(1)=1. P_2(x) = (3x²-1)/2, so at x=1, P_2(1)= (3(1) -1)/2 = 1. Hmm, wait, so all P_l(1) equal 1? That seems odd, but maybe it's correct. So for θ=0, each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] * 1.

So then, the scattering amplitude f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} - 1 )

But wait, what about the imaginary part? The imaginary part of f(0) would be the imaginary part of each term divided by (2ik). Let me write e^{2iδ_l} as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So e^{2iδ_l} -1 is [cos(2δ_l)-1] + i sin(2δ_l). The imaginary part of that is sin(2δ_l). So each term's imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * i. Then, when divided by (2ik), which is (2i k), so the imaginary part would come from the real part of each term multiplied by the denominator's imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me express f(θ) as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ)

So at θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1)=1 as I thought. So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l}-1 )

Now, let's compute the imaginary part of f(0). Let's denote f(0) = A + i B, where A is the real part and B is the imaginary part. We're to find B.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) = (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1 ]

Expanding that: (2l+1)[ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So the real part of each term is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Then, when we sum over all l and multiply by (1/(2ik)), which is (1/(2i k)), which is the same as (-i)/(2k), because 1/i = -i.

So f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) ( (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ) / (2ik) ) ]

Which can be written as sum [ (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l)-1) / (2ik) ) + i (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2ik) ) ]

Simplify each term. Let's look at the imaginary part of f(0). The imaginary part comes from the second term, because the first term has a denominator 2ik, which is a complex number. Wait, perhaps I should separate real and imaginary parts.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that the imaginary part of f(0) is [ (1/(2ik) ) * sum ( (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) ].

Wait, but (1/(2ik)) multiplied by a term, say T, which is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l). So the imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary part of [ (sum T) * (1/(2ik)) ].

Wait, 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k). Because 1/(i) = -i. So 1/(2ik) = (-i)/(2k).

So f(0) = [ sum ( (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) ) ] * [ (-i)/(2k) ) ]

So the imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary part of the product of these two terms.

Let me denote S = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ), since other phase shifts are ignored.

So S = sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ), with l up to 4.

Then, f(0) = S * (-i)/(2k)

The imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary part of [ S * (-i)/(2k) ]

Since (-i) is purely imaginary, let's compute this.

The term (-i)/(2k) is a complex number. Let me express S as a complex number: S = S_real + i S_imag.

Then, [ S * (-i) ] = (S_real + i S_imag) * (-i) = -i S_real + (-i^2) S_imag = -i S_real + S_imag (since i^2 = -1).

So, the product is S_imag - i S_real.

Now, when you multiply by 1/(2k), you get [ S_imag/(2k) ) ] - i [ S_real/(2k) ) ]

So f(0) is [ S_imag/(2k) ) ] - i [ S_real/(2k) ) ]

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is [ S_imag/(2k) ) ].

Because the imaginary part comes from the coefficient of i in the expression. So Im(f(0)) = S_imag/(2k) 

Wait, wait. Wait, f(0) has real part Re(f(0)) = [ S_imag/(2k) ) ] and imaginary part Im(f(0)) = [ - S_real/(2k) ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should look at that again. Because when you have a complex number a + i b, the imaginary part is b. So in the product, the expression [ S * (-i)/(2k) ] is equal to [ S_imag/(2k) ) ] - i [ S_real/(2k) ) ]

So in standard form, that is (S_imag/(2k)) + (- S_real/(2k) ) * i. So the real part is S_imag/(2k), and the imaginary part is (- S_real/(2k)).

Wait, but in the problem, the question is about Im(f(0)), the imaginary part. So Im(f(0)) = (- S_real )/(2k )

Wait, but wait. Let me compute S again. S is the sum of (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ), so S = sum (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l) - 1 ]

Which is sum (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So S = sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So S_real = sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 )

S_imag = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So Im(f(0)) = [ (- S_real ) ] / (2k )

Wait, but in the previous analysis, we have Im(f(0)) = [ (- S_real ) / (2k) ) ]

But wait, is that correct? Because f(0) = [ S * (-i) ]/(2k ), and S is S_real + i S_imag.

So, let's compute S*(-i) = (S_real + i S_imag) * (-i) = -i S_real + (-i)(i S_imag) = -i S_real + S_imag (since i*(-i)=1)

So S*(-i) = S_imag - i S_real.

Then, dividing by 2k, we get [S_imag/(2k)] - i [ S_real/(2k) ]

So f(0) = [ S_imag/(2k) ] - i [ S_real/(2k) ]

So the real part of f(0) is S_imag/(2k), and the imaginary part is (- S_real )/(2k )

Hmm, so Im(f(0)) = (- S_real )/(2k )

Wait, but the problem is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So let's compute S_real.

S_real = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) - 1 )

Given the phase shifts: δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°, and others are ignored.

So let's compute cos(2δ_l) for each l and then compute each term.

Let me compute each term separately.

For l=0: (2*0+1) = 1 * (cos(2*90°) - 1 )

cos(180°) = -1, so (cos(180) -1 )= (-1 -1 )= -2.

So term l=0: 1 * (-2) = -2.

l=1: (3) [ cos(2*67) -1 ]

2*67=134 degrees.

cos(134°) ≈ cos(180-46) = -cos(46°) ≈ -0.694658.

So cos(134) = approx -0.6947.

cos(134°)-1 = (-0.6947 -1 )= -1.6947.

Multiply by 3: 3*(-1.6947) ≈ -5.0841.

l=2: (5) [ cos(110°) - 1 ]

Wait, 2δ2=110 degrees. Because 2 *55=110.

cos(110°)= cos(90+20) = -sin(20) ≈ -0.3420.

So cos(110)-1 = (-0.3420 -1 )= -1.3420. Multiply by 5: 5*(-1.3420)= -6.71.

l=3: (7)[ cos(60°) -1 ]

Wait, 2δ3=60 degrees. cos(60)=0.5. So 0.5-1= -0.5.

Multiply by 7: 7*(-0.5) = -3.5.

l=4: (9)[ cos(26°) -1 ]

2δ4=26 degrees. cos(26)= approx 0.8988.

0.8988-1= -0.1012.

Multiply by 9: 9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.

Now sum all S_real terms:

l=0: -2

l=1: -5.0841 → total so far: -7.0841

l=2: -6.71 → total: -13.7941

l=3: -3.5 → total: -17.2941

l=4: -0.9108 → total: -18.2049.

Wait, let me be precise.

Wait, let me compute each term again, perhaps with more accurate cos values.

For l=0: 2δ0=180°, cos= -1 → term = 1*(-2)= -2.

l=1: 2δ1=134°, cos(134°)= cos(180-46)= -cos(46°)≈-0.694658.

So cos(134°)-1= -0.694658 -1 = -1.694658.

Multiply by 3: 3*(-1.694658)= -5.083974.

l=2: 2δ2=110°, cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= approx -0.3420201.

So cos(110)= -0.3420201. cos(110)-1 = -0.3420201 -1 = -1.3420201.

Multiply by 5: 5*(-1.3420201)= -6.7101005.

l=3: 2δ3=60°, cos(60)=0.5 → 0.5-1= -0.5. Multiply by 7: -3.5.

l=4: 2δ4=26°, cos(26)= approx 0.8987941. So 0.8987941 -1= -0.1012059 → multiply by 9: 9*(-0.1012059)= -0.9108531.

Now sum all these:

-2 + (-5.083974) = -7.083974

-7.083974 + (-6.7101005) = -13.7940745

-13.7940745 + (-3.5) = -17.2940745

-17.2940745 + (-0.9108531)= -18.2049276

So S_real = -18.2049276.

Then, the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0))= (- S_real )/(2k )

Because Im(f(0))= [ (- S_real ) ]/(2k )

Wait, no, wait: earlier, we found that Im(f(0))= [ - S_real ]/(2k )

Wait, let me recheck.

In the previous analysis, Im(f(0)) was -S_real/(2k).

Wait, no, I think earlier I concluded Im(f(0))= [ - S_real ]/(2k )

So, now, S_real is -18.2049276. So -S_real would be 18.2049276.

So Im(f(0)) = 18.2049276/(2k )

But wait, what is k?

In the context of scattering, k is the wave number. For electrons, the relation between the energy and the wave number is given by the relativistic formula, but perhaps in this problem, we can use the non-relativistic approximation for simplicity.

Wait, the energy of the electrons is given as 50 MeV. So I need to compute k, the wave number.

Electron mass m_e is about 0.511 MeV/c². So the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, much larger than the rest mass. Wait, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the non-relativistic formula. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute using the relativistic expression.

Wait, the kinetic energy is K = 50 MeV, so the total energy is E = K + m_e c². But in natural units where c=1, E = K + m_e.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum p, which is sqrt(2mE), but wait, that's the non-relativistic formula. Alternatively, the relativistic formula is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

Since the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, and m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, the total energy E is approximately 50.511 MeV.

So E ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Then, (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 ≈ (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ (50.511)^2.

So pc ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So p = (50.511 MeV ) / c.

The wave number k is p/(ħ c), since p = ħ k.

Wait, let's compute k.

We have k = p/(ħ c) = (50.511 MeV / c ) / ( ħ c )

But for units, perhaps it's better to express in terms of MeV and natural units.

Alternatively, I can use the relation k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach. The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ c), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to use the relativistic relation and express everything in terms of MeV and appropriate constants.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the Compton wavelength, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as follows.

In natural units where ħ = c = 1, the momentum p is E, and k = p, so k = E.

Wait, but for an electron, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But in natural units, with c=1, E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ), where m is in MeV.

So for E = 50.511 MeV,

p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) ≈ sqrt(50.511^2 - 0.511^2 )

Which is approximately sqrt(50.511^2 ), since 0.511 is much smaller than 50.511.

So p ≈ 50.511 MeV.

Then, in natural units, k = p, so k ≈ 50.511 MeV^{-1} ?

Wait, no, in natural units, since ħ = 1, and c=1, and E has units of MeV, and p has units of MeV/c, but since c=1, p has units of MeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let's try a different approach.

The wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ c)

p is in units of MeV/c.

So, to compute k in 1/fm units, perhaps I should use the following approach.

The momentum p is sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that for high energies, E ≈ pc (non-relativistic is E=pc² /2m, but maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, for non-relativistic, E = p^2/(2m), and p = sqrt(2 m E).

Wait, given that the energy is 50 MeV, which is much higher than the rest mass (0.511 MeV), but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, they expect us to use the non-relativistic formula.

So, non-relativistic:

E = p²/(2m)

So p = sqrt(2 m E )

m_e is the electron mass. In kg, m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

But perhaps it's easier to compute in units where ħ is expressed in appropriate terms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of the wavelength.

Wait, another approach. The de Broglie wavelength λ is h/(p), where h is Planck's constant.

So, λ = h / p.

In natural units, h = 2π ħ.

So, λ = 2π ħ / p.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look up the formula for k in terms of energy. I think the correct formula is:

k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ )

Where m is the electron mass, E is the kinetic energy, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

So, let's compute k.

Given:

E = 50 MeV.

But wait, the units are a bit messy. Let me convert everything to SI units.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-14 J.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So,

k = sqrt(2 * m_e * E ) / ħ

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 * m_e * E )

2 * m_e * E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-14 J.

Wait, J is kg·m²/s². So 2 m_e E has units kg² m²/s².

Wait, no, wait. m_e is kg, E is J (kg m²/s²). So 2 m_e E has units (kg) * (kg m²/s²) ) = kg² m²/s².

But the square root would give kg m/s, which is (kg m/s), but that's not the unit for k. Wait, k should have units of 1/m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps in the non-relativistic case, k = (2mE)^½ / ħ.

Wait, the correct formula for k in non-relativistic case is k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

So,

k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ

So compute numerator:

sqrt(2 * m_e * E )

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg

E = 50 MeV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-14 J.

So,

2 * m_e * E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-14 J

= 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-14

= 145.84078e-45 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so kg * kg·m²/s² → kg² · m²/s².

sqrt( kg² m²/s² ) → kg m/s.

So, the numerator is sqrt(2 m E ) = sqrt(145.84078e-45 ) kg m/s ≈ 12.076e-22.5 kg m/s. Wait, let me compute it numerically.

First, compute 2*m_e*E:

= 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-14 J.

= 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-14 * 2.

= 9.109e-31 *1.602e-13 → wait, 8.01e-14 *2=1.602e-13.

So, 9.109e-31 * 1.602e-13 = ?

Calculating 9.109e-31 * 1.602e-13 = (9.109 * 1.602) ) * 1e-44 ≈ 14.585e-44 ≈ 1.4585e-43 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg m²/s², so the product is kg² m²/s².

Taking square root gives kg m/s.

So sqrt(2 m_e E ) = sqrt(1.4585e-43 kg² m²/s² ) = sqrt(1.4585e-43 ) kg m/s.

sqrt(1.4585e-43 ) = approx 1.2077e-21.5 kg m/s.

Wait, 1.4585e-43 is (1.2077e-21.5)^2, because (1e-21.5)^2 = 1e-43.

So sqrt(1.4585e-43 ) ≈ approx 1.2077e-21.5 kg m/s.

But wait, 1e-21.5 is 3.16e-22, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1e-21.5 = 1e-(21 + 0.5) )= 1e-21 * 1e-0.5 ≈ 1e-21 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-22.

So sqrt(1.4585e-43) = approx 1.2077e-21.5 = 1.2077 * 3.1623e-22 ≈ 3.818e-22 kg m/s.

Now, k is this value divided by ħ (1.0545718e-34 J·s )

k = (3.818e-22 kg m/s ) / (1.0545718e-34 J·s )

But J = kg m²/s², so J·s = kg m²/s.

So, numerator has kg m/s, denominator has kg m²/s → so overall units:

(kg m/s) / (kg m²/s ) ) = (1/m )

Which is correct for k.

So,

k = 3.818e-22 / 1.0545718e-34 → approx 3.62e12 m^{-1}

Wait, that's 3.62e12 per meter.

But 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1/m = 1e15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.62e12 m^{-1} = 3.62e12 /1e-15 fm^{-1} → 3.62e27 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 1 m = 1e15 fm, so 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no, if you have a quantity like 3.62e12 m^{-1}, to convert to fm^{-1}, since 1 m = 1e15 fm, then 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So, 3.62e12 m^{-1} = 3.62e12 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 3.62e-3 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's 0.00362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that seems very small. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Wait, let me re-calculate.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 m_e E ) = sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-14 J )

Compute 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

Multiply by 8.01e-14 J: 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-14 = 1.459e-43 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg m²/s², so kg * kg m²/s² = kg² m²/s².

The square root gives kg m/s.

So sqrt(1.459e-43 kg² m²/s² ) = approx 1.208e-21.5 kg m/s.

Wait, 1e-21.5 is 3.16e-22, so 1.208 *3.16e-22 ≈ 3.817e-22 kg m/s.

Now, k = (3.817e-22 kg m/s ) / (1.0545718e-34 J s )

J s is (kg m²/s²) * s )= kg m²/s.

So, kg m/s divided by kg m²/s → (kg m/s ) / (kg m²/s ) = (1/(m )) ), as before.

So,

k = 3.817e-22 / 1.05457e-34 → let me compute this division.

3.817e-22 / 1.05457e-34 → 3.817 /1.05457 ≈ 3.62 → 3.62e12 m^{-1}.

So 3.62e12 m^{-1} → convert to fm^{-1}.

1 m = 1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So, 3.62e12 m^{-1} = 3.62e12 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} = 3.62e-3 fm^{-1} ≈ 0.00362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but that's a very small k. That can't be right because the wavelength would be enormous. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy. The kinetic energy is 50 MeV, but perhaps the total energy E is much larger because it's relativistic.

Wait, the relativistic formula is E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2 )^2.

So, E = 50 MeV (kinetic energy) + m c^2 (0.511 MeV) ≈50.511 MeV.

So,

(pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ≈ (50.511)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ (50.511)^2.

So, pc ≈50.511 MeV.

p = (50.511 MeV ) / c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c ) = (50.511 MeV / c ) / ( ħ c )

So, k = 50.511 MeV/( ħ c^2 )

But ħ c^2 in MeV·fm is a known value.

Wait, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ c^2 = (ħ c ) * c = 197.33 MeV·fm * c.

Wait, no, perhaps better to think in terms of units.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k = (50.511 MeV ) / ( ħ c )

Because p = (50.511 MeV )/(c ), since pc =50.511 MeV.

So,

k = p/( ħ c ) = (50.511 MeV / c ) / ( ħ c ) = 50.511 MeV/( ħ c^2 )

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me find another approach.

Let me compute k in terms of the Compton wavelength.

The Compton wavelength is λ_c = h/(m_e c ) ≈ 2.426e-12 m ≈ 0.2426 fm.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express k as E/(ħ c ), since in natural units, E = ħ c k.

So,

k = E/(ħ c )

E is 50.511 MeV.

But what's ħ c in MeV·fm?

As I said, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So,

k = (50.511 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) → 50.511 /197.33 ≈ 0.256 fm^{-1}.

Because (50.511 /197.33 ) ≈ 0.256.

So, k ≈ 0.256 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because earlier when I did the non-relativistic calculation, I got 3.62e-3 fm^{-1}, which is way off. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic formula and express k as E/(ħ c ), which gives a reasonable k.

So, with k ≈ 0.256 fm^{-1}.

Now, back to computing Im(f(0)).

We had Im(f(0)) = ( - S_real )/(2k )

S_real = sum of (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ) = -18.2049276.

So,

Im(f(0)) = (18.2049276 )/(2 * 0.256 )

Compute denominator: 2 *0.256 =0.512.

So,

Im(f(0)) = 18.2049276 / 0.512 ≈ 35.533 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options: option B is 355.351 fm, option C is 177.675 fm, option D is 251.271 fm, option A is 87163.4 fm.

Wait, 35.533 isn't an option. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor in the calculation.

Wait, earlier I thought that Im(f(0)) = ( - S_real )/(2k )

But wait, in my earlier analysis, I had Im(f(0)) = [ (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) ] * [1/(2k) ]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier steps:

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

Then, I expressed e^{2iδ} -1 as (cos(2δ) -1 ) + i sin(2δ )

Then,

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ) -1 ) + i sum (2l+1) sin(2δ) ]

So,

f(0) = [ sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ)-1 ) ]/(2ik ) + i [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ) ]/(2ik )

Breaking it down, the real part is [ sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ)-1 ) ]/(2ik ), which would be a real number divided by imaginary (since 2ik is imaginary).

The imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ) ]/(2k )

Because 1/(2ik ) = -i/(2k ), and when multiplied by the sum, the imaginary part comes from the real part of [ sum sin terms ] multiplied by -i/(2k ), which would give [ sum sin terms ]/(2k ) as the imaginary part.

So I think I made a mistake earlier in the sign. The correct Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k )

So, to compute Im(f(0)), I should compute sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ), then divide by (2k )

So let's recompute that.

Compute each term:

l=0: 2δ0=180°, sin(180)=0. So term=1 * 0=0.

l=1: 2δ1=134°, sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46°) ≈0.719340. So term=3 *0.719340≈2.15802.

l=2: 2δ2=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.939693. So term=5 *0.939693 ≈4.698465.

l=3: 2δ3=60°, sin(60)=0.8660254. Term=7 *0.8660254≈6.062178.

l=4: 2δ4=26°, sin(26)=0.438371. Term=9 *0.438371≈3.94534.

Now sum all the terms:

l=0: 0 → sum=0.

l=1: +2.15802 → sum=2.15802.

l=2: +4.698465 → sum=6.856485.

l=3: +6.062178 → sum=12.918663.

l=4: +3.94534 → sum=16.864003.

So the sum is approximately 16.864003.

Now, Im(f(0)) = sum / (2k )

Earlier, we found k≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f(0)) = 16.864003 / (2*0.256 )

Denominator: 2*0.256=0.512.

So,

16.864003 / 0.512 ≈33. (Because 16/0.5 is 32, and 0.864/0.512 is about 1.6875 → total approx 33.6875 )

Wait, more accurately,

16.864003 / 0.512 = ?

0.512 × 33 =16.896 → which is just a bit more than 16.864.

So 0.512 ×32.935 = ?

Wait, to compute 16.864003 /0.512:

0.512 ×33 =16.896 → which is 0.032 more than 16.864.

So subtract (0.032 /0.512 )=0.0625 → 33-0.0625=32.9375.

So approximately 32.9375.

Wait, but that's about 32.94, but the options are much larger. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, earlier I calculated k as E/(ħ c ), which gave k≈50.511 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )= approx 0.256 fm^{-1}.

But perhaps that's incorrect. Let me recheck.

Wait, in natural units where ħ= c=1, the energy E is equal to k (since E = ħ k when c=1 and ħ=1).

But in real units, E = ħ c k.

So, k = E/(ħ c )

Given E=50 MeV, so:

k = 50 MeV / (ħ c )

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k = 50 /197.33 fm^{-1} = approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So, that's correct.

So, Im(f(0))=16.864 / (2 *0.253 ) → 16.864 /0.506 ≈33.33 fm.

But the options are much larger. So I'm getting about 33.33 fm, but the options are A) 87163.4 fm, B)355.351 fm, C)177.675 fm, D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Another possibility is that the formula for Im(f(0)) includes a factor of (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), not sin(2δ_l ).

Wait, wait. Let me go back to the original formula for the scattering amplitude.

The scattering amplitude is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So, to compute the imaginary part, I should look at each term's contribution.

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l. So,

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) [ Im(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) ]

Which is,

= (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) ]

Because e^{i x} -1 = cos x + i sin x -1 → Im part is sin x.

So, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So, then,

Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/(2ik )

But 1/(2ik ) = -i/(2k )

So,

Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ] * (-i)/(2k )

But the imaginary part of a complex number is the coefficient of i. So,

Im(f(0)) is the imaginary part of [ sum ... * (-i)/(2k ) ]

Which would be [ sum ... ] * (1/(2k )) )

Because (-i)/(2k ) multiplied by the sum (which is real) gives a purely imaginary number, where the imaginary part is [ sum * (-1) ]/(2k )

Wait, but in any case, the magnitude of the imaginary part is sum/(2k )

But in our calculation, sum(2l+1) sin(2δ_l )=16.864.

k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So,

Im(f(0))=16.864/(2*0.256 )=16.864 /0.512 ≈33.33 fm.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, let's recompute that.

Let me recompute each term accurately.

l=0:

δ0=90° → 2δ0=180°, sin(180)=0. Term: (1)*0=0.

l=1:

δ1=67° → 2δ1=134°.

sin(134°)=sin(180-46)=sin(46°)=approx 0.71934.

Term: 3 * 0.71934 ≈2.15802.

l=2:

δ2=55° →2δ2=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)=approx 0.939693.

Term:5 *0.939693 ≈4.698465.

l=3:

δ3=30° →2δ3=60°, sin(60)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.8660254.

Term:7 *0.8660254≈6.062178.

l=4:

δ4=13° →2δ4=26°, sin(26)= approx 0.438371.

Term:9 *0.438371≈3.945339.

Sum:

0 +2.15802 +4.698465 =6.856485

+6.062178 →12.918663

+3.945339 →16.864002.

So sum is approximately 16.864002.

So Im(f(0))=16.864002/(2k )

k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

So, 2k=0.512.

16.864002 /0.512 → approximately 33.333 fm.

Hmm, but the options are all larger than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps k should be in 1/(fm) units, but when I compute k = E/(ħ c ), I should double-check the units.

Wait, E is in MeV, ħ c is in MeV fm.

So,

k = E (MeV) / (ħ c ) (MeV fm )

So,

k has units of 1/fm.

Which is correct.

So E=50 MeV,

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm → k=50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe I need to calculate k as sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but that would be non-relativistic. But since the energy is high, I think relativistic is correct.

Another approach: Perhaps the problem expects us to ignore relativistic effects and use the non-relativistic formula.

If I compute k using non-relativistic formula:

k = (2mE)^½ / ħ.

E=50 MeV, but in non-relativistic, E is kinetic energy.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses units where k is in 1/fm, and the calculation is done differently.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to use the relation k = (2mE)^½ / ħ, but with E in eV and m in kg, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation k = (2mE)^(1/2) / ħ, but with E being the kinetic energy.

Wait, let's compute k using non-relativistic approach.

E = 50 MeV =50e6 eV.

m_e = 9.109e-31 kg.

Compute k = sqrt(2 m_e E ) / ħ.

But E is in joules: 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-14 J.

So,

2 m_e E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-14 J = 1.458e-43 kg^2 m^2/s^2.

sqrt(1.458e-43 ) = 1.207e-21.5 kg m/s.

Then, ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

So,

k = (1.207e-21.5 ) / (1.0545718e-34 )

Which equals 1.207e-21.5 /1.0545718e-34 → approximately (1.207 /1.0545718 ) *1e12.5 → approx 1.144 *3.16e12 → approx 3.61e12 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m=1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So, 3.61e12 m^{-1} =3.61e12 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =3.61e-3 fm^{-1} ≈0.00361 fm^{-1}.

So, Im(f(0))=16.864/(2 *0.00361 )

Denominator: 2*0.00361=0.00722.

So,

16.864 /0.00722 ≈ 2336 fm.

But this isn't any of the options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recheck the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ).

Wait, let me compute each term again:

l=0: 1 * sin(180) →0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°)=3*(0.71934 )=2.15802.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.939693=4.698465.

l=3:7 * sin(60 )=7*(0.8660254)=6.062178.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.438371=3.945339.

Sum: 0 +2.15802=2.15802 +4.698465=6.856485 +6.062178=12.918663 +3.945339=16.864002.

Yes, this is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), not 2δ_l ?

Because phase shifts δ_l are often used in the formula as e^{2iδ_l }, but perhaps I made a mistake in doubling the angle.

Wait, the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So, when taking the imaginary part, it's the imaginary part of e^{2iδ_l} -1, which is sin(2δ_l )

So, the sum should indeed be (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

But if I mistakenly took sin(δ_l ), what would happen?

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.92050≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5*0.81915≈4.09575.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum:1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.09575=7.85725 +3.5=11.35725 +2.02455=13.3818.

Then Im(f(0))=13.3818/(2k )

With k=0.256 → denominator 0.512.

So Im(f(0))=13.3818 /0.512≈26.13 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), not sin(2δ_l )

But that contradicts the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses δ_l as the phase shift, and the amplitude is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l (cosθ )

In that case, Im(f(0)) would be (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Which brings us back to the original calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different definition, perhaps without the factor of 2 in the exponent. Let's see.

Suppose the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} P_l (cosθ )

Then, the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )/(2k )

Which would give a larger value.

Compute sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )

As before, sum is approx 13.3818.

So Im(f(0))=13.3818/(2k )=13.3818/(2*0.256 )=13.3818/0.512≈26.13 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k.

Wait, earlier, I calculated k using E=50 MeV and got k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

But perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, and the total energy is higher.

Wait, the total energy E_total = K + m c^2 =50 MeV +0.511 MeV≈50.511 MeV.

Using relativistic formula, E_total = sqrt( (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So,

pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 )

= sqrt( (50.511)^2 - (0.511 )^2 ) ≈50.511.

So, pc≈50.511 MeV → p≈50.511 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c )

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k= (50.511 MeV/c )/(197.33 MeV fm ) → the c cancels.

So,

k=50.511 /197.33 fm^{-1} ≈0.256 fm^{-1}.

Hmm, same as before.

Another possibility: The problem might have given the phase shifts as δ1, δ2, etc., but perhaps it's using a different convention, like each term contributes (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), but no, that doesn't fit the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), but that would give a larger sum.

Wait, if the sum is 13.3818, Im(f(0))=13.3818/(2k )=13.3818/(0.512 )=26.13 fm.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) * (1/(k )) ?

Wait, but that would make Im(f(0))= 13.3818/(0.256 )=52.27 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula includes a factor of 2 somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the denominator.

Wait, the formula is:

Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ] / (2k )

Which gives 16.864/(2*0.256 )=16.864/0.512=33.33 fm.

But options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula without the 2 in the denominator.

So, Im(f(0))= sum/(k )

Which would be 16.864 /0.256 ≈65.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) as 16.864 and multiply by (1/(2k )).

But with k=0.256, (1/(2k ))= 1/0.512≈1.9531.

So, 16.864 *1.9531≈33.04.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the 2 in the denominator and just use (1/k )

So, 16.864 / 0.256 ≈65.8 fm.

Not an option.

Another possibility: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees.

Wait, the phase shifts are given in degrees. Did I convert them correctly to radians?

Wait, let's recalculate all the sines using radians.

Compute each angle in radians.

l=0: 2δ0=180° → π radians. sin(π)=0.

l=1: 2δ1=134 degrees → 134 * π/180 ≈2.341 radians. sin(2.341)=approx 0.71934.

l=2:110 degrees → 1.91986 radians. sin=0.939693.

l=3:60 degrees →1.0472 radians. sin=0.8660254.

l=4:26 degrees →0.4537 radians. sin=0.438371.

Same as before.

Hmm, no change.

Another thought: perhaps I should include all the higher phase shifts beyond l=4, but the question says to ignore the rest, so only up to l=4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), not sin(2δ_l )

Which would give a sum of 13.3818.

Then, Im(f(0))=13.3818/(2k )=13.3818/(0.512)=26.13 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the relativistic energy without the rest mass.

So, E=50 MeV.

Then, k=50/(197.33 )=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Same as before.

I'm stuck. I must have made a mistake somewhere because none of my results match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), and the formula is (1/k ) * sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (2i )

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula.

Another approach: The scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the optical theorem.

The optical theorem says that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of f(0).

Wait, but that's a different approach. The optical theorem states that:

Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) * σ_total,

where σ_total is the total cross-section.

But I don't know σ_total, so perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the imaginary part as the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), without the 2 in front of δ_l.

But earlier, when I computed that sum, I had 13.3818.

So,

Im(f(0))=13.3818/(2k )=13.3818/(0.512 )=26.13 fm.

Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses sin(δ_l ), and the denominator is k, not 2k.

Im(f(0))=13.3818/(0.256 )=52.27 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the initial formula.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) )/(2ik) * P_l (cosθ )

At θ=0, P_l (1)=1.

So,

Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) Im(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )/(2ik )

But,

Im(e^{2iδ_l} -1 )= sin(2δ_l )

So,

Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/(2k )

Because 1/(2ik )= -i/(2k ), and when you take the imaginary part, it's [ sum ... ]/(2k )

So, correct calculation is Im(f(0))= sum/(2k )

Which with sum=16.864 and k=0.256,

Im(f(0))=16.864/(2 *0.256 )=16.864/0.512=33.33 fm.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering that the phase shifts are given in different units. For example, maybe they're given in radians, but I used degrees. No, I think I did convert them correctly.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I treated them as degrees. Let me recalculate the sines using radians.

Wait, no, I think I computed them correctly because 90 degrees is π/2 radians, so sin is 1.

Wait, perhaps a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, let me recalculate the sum:

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134 degrees)=3*0.71934=2.15802.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.939693=4.698465.

l=3:7* sin(60)=7*0.8660254=6.062178.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.438371=3.945339.

Sum: 0 +2.15802 +4.698465 =6.856485 +6.062178=12.918663 +3.945339=16.864002.

Same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by k, not Im(f(0)) itself.

Because in the formula, Im(f(0)) = sum/(2k ), but perhaps the answer expects the value of Im(f(0)) multiplied by 2k.

Which would be sum=16.864.

Wait, 16.864 is approximately 17. So, looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm, which is 16.864 *10.55 → but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's options are off by a factor of 10.

Wait, 33.33 is closest to option C (177.675), which is about 5.3 times larger.

But I don't see why that would be the case.

Another possibility: Perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the phase shifts are in the form δ_l, and the formula uses l as the orbital angular momentum quantum number, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )/(2k ), which would give 13.3818/(0.512 )=26.13 fm.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is in a different unit. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me recompute k.

Using E=50 MeV, relativistic approach.

E^2 = (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 → pc = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) ≈ E.

So, p≈E/(c )

k = p/(ħ c )

So,

k = ( E/(c ) )/( ħ c ) ) = E/( ħ c^2 )

But ħ c^2 is (ħ c ) * c → since ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm,

ħ c^2 =197.33 MeV fm * c → but wait, units are getting messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of MeV.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I think the correct approach is to proceed with the calculation as I did earlier, leading to Im(f(0))=33.33 fm, but since none of the options match, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm.

Wait, 355.351 /33.33 ≈10.66.

Which is roughly (20/2)=10. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 somewhere. Maybe I forgot that k should be in 1/(fm), but I computed it correctly as 0.256 fm^{-1}.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k, and it should be 0.256 inverse angstroms, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is given in GeV instead of MeV, but the question says 50 MeV.

I think I'm stuck, but based on the calculation, the closest option to my result isn't present. But perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f(0)), and the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm.

But I'm not confident. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I'll go with the calculation I did and see if any option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ). Let me recheck.

Wait, another approach: compute each term's sin(2δ) accurately.

l=0: δ0=90° → 2δ=180°, sin=0 → term=0.

l=1:δ=67° → 2δ=134°, sin(134)=sin(46)=0.71934 → term=3 *0.71934=2.15802.

l=2:δ=55 → 2δ=110°, sin=0.93969 → term=5*0.93969=4.69845.

l=3:δ=30 →60°, sin=0.866025 →7 *0.866025=6.062175.

l=4:δ=13 →26°, sin=0.43837 →9 *0.43837=3.94533.

Sum:2.15802 +4.69845=6.85647 +6.062175=12.91865 +3.94533=16.864.

Thus, sum=16.864.

k=0.256 fm^{-1}.

Im(f(0))=16.864/(2*0.256 )=33.333 fm.

Since none of the options match, perhaps the correct answer is option B:355.351 fm, but I don't see how.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute it.

Compute k as E/(ħ c ) → E=50 MeV, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, k=50 /197.33 = approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Thus, Im(f(0))=16.864/(2*0.253 )=16.864/0.506≈33.33 fm.

I think that's the correct answer, but it's not one of the options. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the calculation, but I can't find where.

In the given options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger than my result. So perhaps I missed a factor of 10 in the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should have calculated the sum in terms of sin(δ_l ), not sin(2δ_l ), leading to 13.3818/(2k )=26.13 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by 2π, but that would give 66.66 fm, which is option not present.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum)/(k ) → 16.864/0.256=65.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Another possibility: Perhaps the phase shifts are given as δ_l for l=0 to 4, but the formula includes a factor of (2l+1) in front of sin(δ_l ), but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l } P_l (cosθ )/(2ik )

Which is correct.

Thus, the imaginary part would be sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k )

Which is what I did.

Thus, the result is 33.33 fm.

But no option matches. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not sure.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts \( \delta_l \) through the formula:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \left( e^{2i\delta_l} - 1 \right),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. At \( \theta = 0 \), the Legendre polynomial \( P_l(1) = 1 \), so the formula simplifies. The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) for each \( l \)
The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and higher phase shifts are ignored. Using these, compute \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) for each \( l \):

- \( l = 0 \): \( 2\delta_0 = 180^\circ \), \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), term = \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- \( l = 1 \): \( 2\delta_1 = 134^\circ \), \( \sin(134^\circ) = \sin(46^\circ) \approx 0.71934 \), term = \( 3 \cdot 0.71934 \approx 2.15802 \).
- \( l = 2 \): \( 2\delta_2 = 110^\circ \), \( \sin(110^\circ) = \sin(70^\circ) \approx 0.939693 \), term = \( 5 \cdot 0.939693 \approx 4.698465 \).
- \( l = 3 \): \( 2\delta_3 = 60^\circ \), \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660254 \), term = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660254 \approx 6.062178 \).
- \( l = 4 \): \( 2\delta_4 = 26^\circ \), \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.438371 \), term = \( 9 \cdot 0.438371 \approx 3.945339 \).

Summing these terms:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.15802 + 4.698465 + 6.062178 + 3.945339 = 16.864002.
\]

### Step 2: Compute the wave number \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the energy \( E \) of the electrons by:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c},
\]

where \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \). For \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \):

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
Using the formula for \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \):

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l)}{2k},
\]

substitute \( \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 16.864002 \) and \( k \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1} \):

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864002}{2 \cdot 0.253} = \frac{16.864002}{0.506} \approx 33.33 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 33.33 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. The closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which is approximately 10 times larger than the computed result. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the calculation or an issue with the provided options.

### Conclusion
Based on the calculation, the most reasonable choice is **B) 355.351 fm**, though the exact factor of discrepancy remains unclear.
