Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The problem gives a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. I need to find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, I remember that symmetry groups are determined by the arrangement of atoms in a molecule and the operations that leave the molecule looking the same. Common symmetry groups include C2 (2-fold rotation), D4h (which is a higher symmetry group with multiple reflection planes and a 4-fold rotation axis), D∞h (infinite symmetry like in CO2 or linear molecules), and C2v (a group with a 2-fold rotation and a mirror plane).

Let me try to piece together the reactions to figure out what each compound might be.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking about possible red products. Maybe something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Wait, 8 equivalents might imply a stoichiometric ratio where A is in a lower oxidation state and B is being oxidized, or maybe it's a substitution reaction.

Another thought: Perhaps A is sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacting with B as chlorine gas (Cl2). Sodium sulfide has S^2- ions. If B is Cl2, then the reaction could produce S (elemental sulfur) which is bright yellow or orange-red. But wait, sulfur is bright yellow, not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal complex. Or perhaps it's another reaction.

Wait, another possibility: If A is sodium chloride (NaCl), and B is something else. But that might not fit the 8 equivalents part. Alternatively, maybe A is something like FeO, and B is Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction to form a metal sulfide. Hmm, not sure yet.

Moving on to the next reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Extremely hazardous products could be things like phosgene (but I'm not sure), or maybe something like HCl gas, but that's not extremely hazardous in the same way. Wait, perhaps E is something like COCl2 (phosgene), which is highly toxic. Or maybe E is a cyanide compound, but again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like ozone, but ozone is a gas, not a product of this reaction.

Wait, another angle. C reacts with water to form A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids. Let's think about what could produce two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, a salt that is the conjugate base of a weak acid and a strong acid. For instance, if C is a metal chloride, say MgCl2, but that would hydrolyze to Mg(OH)2 and HCl. Wait, but HCl is a strong acid. Alternatively, if C is a salt like Na2S, which when hydrolyzed would produce H2S (a weak acid) and NaOH, which is a strong base, but that doesn't fit the two different acids. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal carbonate, but that would produce CO2 and a strong acid like H2SO4 if the metal is from a sulfuric acid salt.

Wait, another thought. Suppose C is a metal sulfide. When metal sulfides react with water, they usually form the corresponding metal hydroxide and H2S gas (a weak acid). But in this case, the problem says C reacts with water to form A plus two different acids F and G. So perhaps C is a salt that, upon hydrolysis, produces two different acids. For example, if C is a salt of a weak acid and another weak acid, like something with multiple anions.

Wait, maybe C is something like Na2S2O3 (sodium thiosulfate). When it hydrolyzes, it can produce S (sulfur) which would form A (maybe S?), and maybe other products. Not sure.

Alternatively, if
