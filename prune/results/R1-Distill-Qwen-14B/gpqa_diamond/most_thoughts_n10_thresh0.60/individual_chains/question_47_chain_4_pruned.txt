Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out what compound C9H11NO2 it is based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C9H11NO2. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there are no halogens (X=0) and one N, it's (2*9 + 2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees: likely a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), maybe a double bond or a ring plus another double bond, and perhaps some other groups.

Now, looking at the IR data. The strong bands are at 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. These are broad or strong? The question says medium to strong. Well, in IR, peaks around 3300-3500 usually indicate N-H or O-H stretches. But O-H is usually broader and stronger. However, since there are two peaks, maybe they're from N-H in an amide or amine. Or perhaps they could be from an O-H in a carboxylic acid, but the strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. For carboxylic acids, the O-H is usually very strong and broad, and the carbonyl is a bit lower, around 1700 maybe. But wait, 1720 is more like an ester or amide.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's an amide. Amides have N-H stretches around 3300-3500, usually as two peaks because of the two N-H groups (if it's a secondary amide). So, the medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 could be N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 is a carbonyl, probably an amide or an ester. Let's hold onto that thought.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's list the peaks:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → probably a CH2CH3 group as a triplet. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, like ethyl groups. So maybe ethyl ester or ethyl amide?

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → broad singlet for 2H. That could be -OCH2- or something like that. Or maybe an NH2 group, but NH protons usually are broad but I'm not sure about the coupling. Alternatively, maybe an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So maybe a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ester group. For example, in an ethyl ester, the group would be OCH2CH3. Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet. Wait, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen. Let me think: in ethyl groups, the CH3 is a triplet around 1.2 ppm, and the OCH2 is a quartet around 4.1. So here, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher, perhaps an ester or amide.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So two doublets, each 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, leading to two doublets for the aromatic protons. So, perhaps a substituent in the para position, like a nitro, methoxy, or something else, causing the splitting.

Putting this together, the aromatic region in NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene. So, the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy group at position 3. But then the aromatic protons wouldn't be para; if substituents are at 3 and maybe another position, but wait, benzamide is a CONH2 group. Wait, the structure is benzamide with an ethoxy at position 3. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, but maybe not symmetric.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. So, the benzene ring has substituents at 4: ethoxy and the formamide group. Wait, maybe. So, the substituents are at para positions? Because 4-ethoxyphenyl would have the ethoxy at position 4, and the formamide is attached as a substituent as well. Wait, but that would make two substituents on the benzene: ethoxy and formamide. So, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzamide but with an amine group. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionate group (maybe as ester or amide). Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate: benzene (C6H5) plus NH2 (1), then a propionate group (C3H5O2). So C6+3=9, H: 5 (from C6H5) + 5 (from propionate)=10? Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2, so maybe the propionate is an ester?

Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-NH2? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, it's the ester, where the propionate is attached as COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Or perhaps
