Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a reaction involving some kind of benzene ring compound reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The researcher used TLC and found two new spots where the reactant spot had diminished. So, the reaction must have proceeded to form two products.

The starting material is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main group attached to the benzene is an ether group (oxy), and the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Wait, so the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. Let me draw this out mentally. The substituent would be CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH2-CH2-O- attached to benzene? No, wait, no, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Or wait, but but-3-en would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4? No, wait, but the numbering for butene can be a bit confusing. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but but has four carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? Wait, no, that's but-1-en-4-yl. Wait maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The structure is but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is at position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4? Wait, but but only has four carbons. So, but-3-en-1-yl would be: position 1 is the point of attachment. So the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2
