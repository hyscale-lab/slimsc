Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Starting with the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches. Like, alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids have broad O-H. But wait, FTIR also shows strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But 1650 is a bit lower. Hmm, could that be another carbonyl group, maybe like a conjugated system or an aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's an absorption from something else like an amide, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another possibility: 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe a ketone with conjugation. Alternatively, it might not be a carbonyl. Let me think. Another common peak around 1650 is the C=C stretching in alkenes or maybe an aromatic ring. But wait, if the compound has both a carbonyl and a C=C, that would fit with something like an ester or a ketone plus an alkene.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So the compound has an alkene group. So that's another piece of evidence pointing towards a structure with a double bond.

Now the Mass Spec data: the fragment peak at m/z =45. I remember that 45 is a common mass for certain fragments. For example, the (CH3)2CO+ ion (acetone) is 58, so that's not it. Wait, 45 could be a fragment from something else. Let me think. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 30 (for the two methyl groups) plus 15 (for O) would be 45? Wait, no, 15 is O, but wait, (CH3)2O is 30 (from two CH3 groups: each is 15, so 30) plus 16 (O) gives 46. Hmm, that's not 45. Wait, maybe it's something else. 45 is also the molecular weight for CH2Cl2, but that's not likely here. Alternatively, 45 could be a CH3CO+ ion, which is 43? No, wait, CH3CO+ is 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16 = 24+3+16=43). Wait, perhaps it's a different fragment. Maybe a ketene ion? Or maybe a fragment from an ester.

Alternatively, maybe the m/z 45 comes from a smaller group. Let me think about the possible structures. If the compound is something like an ester, it's possible to have a fragment that loses the carbonyl group. Wait, but esters typically lose the OR group or the R group, depending on the structure.

Let me try to tie all this data together. The compound has O-H (from the broad peak), a carbonyl (from 1700), and an alkene (from the vinyl NMR peaks). So maybe it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Or perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. But wait, the FTIR has a broad O-H, which in esters isn't as broad as in carboxylic acids because esters have less acidic hydrogens. So if the O-H is broad, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But if that's the case, the IR would show a very strong absorption around 1700 for the carboxylic acid O-H? Wait, no, the 1700 is the carbonyl, and the broad peak is the O-H. But carboxylic acids have O-H around 2500-3300, which is very broad. Oh wait, in the question, the FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000. That fits with carboxylic acid O-H.

But wait, the 1700 cm^-1 is high for a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids typically show a strong absorption around 1700-1725 cm^-1. So that fits. Then the 1650 could be from an aromatic ring (like a benzene ring with conjugation) or perhaps from another carbonyl group. Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, maybe it's conjugated. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? No, because a ketone would have a single carbonyl peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

So the structure could be something like an unsaturated carboxylic acid. Let's think about the formula. The options are all C6H something O or O2. Let me compute the degrees of unsaturation for each formula.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since all formulas have no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6,
