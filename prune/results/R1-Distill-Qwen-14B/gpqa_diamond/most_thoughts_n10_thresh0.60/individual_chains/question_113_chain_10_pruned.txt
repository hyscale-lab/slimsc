Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me think about each piece of data and how it might help me narrow down the possibilities.

First, the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretches. A broad peak suggests that it's either an alcohol (like -OH in a carboxylic acid or phenol) or maybe an amine, but I don't think there's any mention of amines here. Also, the presence of a broad peak at 3000 might indicate an -OH group. So, the compound probably has an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, the question says several peaks in the 1H NMR, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are in alkenes, so the compound probably has a double bond as well.

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The peak at 1700 is a strong peak, typical of carbonyl groups like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or acids. The peak around 1650 could be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretch) or another carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or an acid where the carbonyl is at a slightly lower wavenumber. Also, sometimes, the 1650 might be due to an ester or a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring (like benzene) with the ring's C=C stretching. Wait, but benzene's ring stretch is usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1, but 1650 is on the higher side. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that affect the wavenumber, or it's a conjugated carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, so the compound has a double bond. For example, in an alkene, the H's on the double bond would be split into a certain pattern, like a doublet of doublets or something similar, depending on the substitution.

Now, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. Let me think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments with 45 m/z include CH3CO (which is 43, wait, no, maybe another group) or perhaps a methyl ester? Wait, 45 is the molecular ion for some small molecules. Let's think: the molecular weight of 45 would be the sum of the isotopes. For example, (CH3)2CO is acetone, but its molecular ion is 58. Hmm, maybe it's a fragment. Like, if the compound undergoes cleavage, a common fragment is CH2COO- which is 60, but maybe a smaller part.

Wait, 45 could be from a fragment like C3H7O. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl group attached to something. Or maybe it's a ketene? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2
