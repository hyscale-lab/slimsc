Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization again? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle those infinities. But why would a theory not need regularization?

Right, I think that some theories don't require regularization because they don't have these divergences in the first place, or perhaps they have a way to handle them without needing this process. Or maybe because they are already finite, meaning they don't produce these problematic infinities.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory which is a theory of quantum gravity. I remember that string theories in general are supposed to be finite. Because they're higher-dimensional and include gravity, they might not have the same types of divergences as lower-dimensional theories. So they might not require regularization because their perturbation expansions are finite, avoiding the need for such techniques. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think string theory calculations do involve some infinities, but they might not require the same kind of regularization as other QFTs because the theory itself is more complete.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I know that QCD does require regularization because it deals with things like renormalization. The calculations can lead to divergent loop integrals, so you have to regularize them, maybe using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. QED does have issues with divergences, especially in higher-order loop diagrams. Because of that, it requires regularization techniques. But wait, I also remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, meaning that you can handle the divergences by renormalization, which would involve some regularization steps. So QED does require regularization.

Option D: Classical
