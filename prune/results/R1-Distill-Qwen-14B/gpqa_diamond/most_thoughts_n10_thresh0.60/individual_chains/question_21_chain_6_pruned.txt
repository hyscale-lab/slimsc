Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main question is about tautomerism and optical isomerism in given compounds.

The compounds mentioned are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione for part A. Then for part B, the compounds are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate. The task is to determine which compound in each pair doesn't show tautomerism (for A) and which shows optical isomerism (for B).

First, let's tackle part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different isomeric forms. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move, like in enol and keto forms. For example, in ketones, if there's a conjugated system allowing for such shifts, tautomerism is possible.

Looking at the two compounds:

1. Benzoquinone: Benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Specifically, it's an aromatic ring (like benzene) with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the ring. Wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Depending on the positions, it can be para or ortho. But either way, it's a diketone. Can it undergo tautomerism? I'm not so sure. Wait, tautomerism usually involves the movement of a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. For instance, in a diketone, can the hydrogen shift between the two carbonyl groups?

Wait, maybe not. Benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Let me think about its structure. Benzoquinone has two oxygen atoms in the ring. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is actually a cyclic diene with two ketone groups attached. Oh no, that's not right. Wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, the structure is benzene with two O groups, each attached via
