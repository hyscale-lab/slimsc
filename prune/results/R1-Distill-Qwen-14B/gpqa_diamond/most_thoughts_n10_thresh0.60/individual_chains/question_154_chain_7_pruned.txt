Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the scenario is a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and they've got some spectral data to figure out what it is. The options are four different compounds, all chlorobenzoic acid derivatives or something similar.

The data given includes mass spec, IR, and 1H NMR. Let's take each piece of data one by one.

First, the mass spectrometry. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 which is 32% intensity. Hmm, molecular ion suggests the molecular weight is 156. The 158 peak could be a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope? Wait, chlorine has an atomic weight around 35.5, so the molecular formula might have a Cl.

Wait, let me think. Chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So, if the molecular ion is at 156, and the next one is 158, that's a difference of 2, which would fit with a chlorine isotope. So, perhaps the molecular formula includes Cl. So the molecule has a molecular weight of about 156, and the molecular ion accounts for that. The peak at 158 is 32%â€”so that's about the percentage of the 37Cl isotope? Let me calculate. If the molecule has one Cl, then the molecular ion would have peaks at 156 (35Cl) and 158 (37Cl). The ratio of the peaks is 32% for 158. The natural abundance of 37Cl is about 24.2%, so if the main peak is 100%, the 158 peak should be less than that. But wait, the 158 is 32%, which is higher than 24.2%. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the data. Alternatively, maybe the molecular weight isn't 156 but the molecular ion is, and the molecule has an additional oxygen or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula of the options: Let's look at the options
