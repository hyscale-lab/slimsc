Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think through it.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's noted that X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's start by figuring out what each part might mean.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violently reacting, so perhaps something like a strong acid reacting with a metal or carbonate. The gas W has same neutrons and protons. Let's think about that: a molecule where the number of neutrons equals protons. Wait, but each molecule is made of atoms. So each atom must have equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule's total protons equals total neutrons?

Wait, the molecule of gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. Could it be H2? No, because H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So H2 would have 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. What about CO2? No, but wait, maybe something else.

Wait, another angle: if W is a gas, perhaps a diatomic gas. Let's think about molecules where the total neutrons equal the total protons. Let's take O2: each O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (since O is usually 16, which is 8+8). So O2 would have 16 protons (8*2), 16 neutrons (8*2). So yes, that fits. So gas W could be O2. Alternatively, what's another possibility? Maybe CO is a gas, but the protons would be 6 (C) + 8 (O) = 14, and neutrons would be 6 (C has 6 neutrons in 12C) + 8 (O-16 has 8) =14. So CO would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So that also fits.

Wait, but CO is a gas, but it's not produced in most common reactions. Let me think about the reaction. Another possibility is H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm. Or maybe a different gas.

Wait, maybe the gas is something like NH3? No, because it's a gas, but when would that form? Alternatively, perhaps CH4? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe N2? Let's see. N has 7 protons, 7 neutrons (if using N-14). So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That
