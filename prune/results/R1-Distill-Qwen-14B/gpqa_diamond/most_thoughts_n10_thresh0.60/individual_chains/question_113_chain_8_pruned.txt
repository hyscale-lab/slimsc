Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by carefully reading through the question and the options.

Alright, the question says that the unknown compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, sometimes even around 2500-3300. So a broad peak here could mean either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, but I'll need more data.

Then, the FTIR also has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for carbonyl groups. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl in IR would be around 1700. However, the 1650 cm^-1 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester or something else.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum: it mentions several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests that there's an alkene group in the compound. That's important.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, m/z 45 is a key fragment. I remember that 45 could come from several sources. For example, it could be a methyl group attached to something else, but more importantly, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3O or maybe a fragment like (CH2)2O. Alternatively, it's the same as the molecular weight of (CH2)3, but that's 14*3=42, which isn't 45. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl group with a fragment. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 15 + 1*2 + 12*2? Wait, no, (CH3)2O is (12*2)+(1*6)+(16) = 24 +6 +16=46. Oh wait, no, 12*(2 C) is 24, H is 6*1=6, O is 16. Total 46. So that's not 45.

Wait, 45 is 12*3 + 6*1 + 3*1? No, that might not add up. Alternatively, 45 is the molecular weight of C3H9O. Or perhaps it's the molecular weight of something else. Let me think of common fragments. Another possibility is the (CH3CO) group, but that's more like 43 (43 for CH3CO+ something? Wait, 43 is for CH3COOH without the H2O? Not sure.

Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from an ester group. For example, if the compound has an ester group, the fragmentation could lose the R-O- part, leaving the carbonyl and some other groups. Alternatively, another possibility is that the fragment at m/z=45 is from a smaller group within the molecule, like a methyl ester or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is the methyl group attached to an oxygen, but that would be 15 for CH3O. Oh, but 45 would be a larger fragment. Maybe a propyl group attached to an oxygen? Or perhaps a different functional group.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the options and see what their possible functional groups could be. The options are:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10
