Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but usually quantum states are represented as column vectors with complex numbers, right? Or maybe they're just normalized? Hmm, but the numbers here are real. I should probably check if this state is normalized. Let me calculate the norm. The dot product of the vector with itself is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm squared is 6. Therefore, the state vector is not normalized. So, maybe I should normalize it first? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. 

Wait, but the question is about probabilities after measurements. So perhaps the state is given as a column vector, but not necessarily normalized. But when we calculate the probabilities, we might need to normalize it. Or maybe the given state is already normalized, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The sum of squares is 6, so the norm is sqrt(6), so the state is not normalized. So perhaps I should divide each component by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are of unit length. So the actual state vector would be (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Wait, but the problem doesn
