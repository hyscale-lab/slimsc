Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this particle physics problem. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. Let me start by understanding the given information. 

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f(y) (ν + X(y)) ψf(y). Hmm, I think this describes an interaction between the boson field X and some fermion fields. The fermions must be of type f, which could be different quarks or leptons depending on the context.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find all possible decay products of X into fermion-antifermion pairs at the lowest order. Remember, in decay processes, the total energy must be conserved, and the rest mass of X will determine which particles it can decay into.

First, I should recall that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the fermion's mass must be less than half the mass of the boson. Because, in the rest frame of X, each fermion gets at least half the mass. So if the boson mass is M, the maximum mass of each fermion is M/2.

So X has a mass of 6 GeV. So each fermion must have a mass less than 3 GeV.

Now I need to list all the known fermions and their masses. Let's think about the quarks and leptons:

Quarks (current masses, approximate):
- Up (u): ~2 MeV
- Down (d): ~5 MeV
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: very light, negligible mass for this purpose.

Wait, but for neutrinos, their masses are typically considered as non-zero but tiny. But in many cases, especially in tree-level processes, they can be ignored because their mass is negligible compared to others. So when considering decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs, it's possible, but the problem here is about the interaction given. Let's look back at the Lagrangian.

The interaction term is λf ψ̄f (ν + X) ψf. Hmm, that seems a bit off. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh, perhaps it's λ times f times ψ̄ times (ν + X) times ψ. So the interaction is with the fermion field ψf, and the boson X is coupling to this fermion. So X can decay into ψf and ψ̄f. So the possible decay products are pairs of fermions f.

So the fermion f can be any type of quark or lepton, but we need to check if their mass is less than 3 GeV.

Wait, no. Wait, the interaction is written as -λ f ψ̄f (ν + X) ψf. That might not make complete sense. Maybe it's a Yukawa-like coupling. Alternatively, perhaps the term is supposed to be something like ψ̄ (something) ψ, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the correct term is something like ψ̄ (ν + X) ψ, multiplied by some coupling. But regardless, the key point is that X couples to fermions f.

So which fermions can X decay into? It can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where each fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV.

So let's list all possible fermions and their masses:

Light quarks (u, d, s, c, but wait, c is 1.5 GeV. Wait
