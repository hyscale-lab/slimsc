Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand the question.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products for each. The options are given as A and B, each with different possibilities. I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+. I'm a bit rusty on spiro compounds, but I remember they have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure here is a spiro compound with two rings—probably a five-membered and a seven-membered ring? Wait, no, the spiro notation is [3.5], so one ring has 3 carbons and the other 5. So, putting it together, the spiro is where the two rings share a single carbon. The molecule has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to that spiro carbon. Also, there's a double bond at position 5, so the structure must have some conjugation or possibility for ring-opening or rearrangement.

The reagents are THF (a solvent, usually for Grignard or other organometallic reactions), KH (which is potassium hydride, a strong base), and then H+ as workup. So, I think the conditions are for deprotonation followed by some kind of reaction. But wait, with such a base as KH, perhaps it's a deprotonation to form an enolate or some conjugate base. Alternatively, since there's a spiro system, maybe it's undergoing some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement under basic conditions.

Wait, another thought: the spiro compound might undergo a ring-opening via a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen-like rearrangement. Or maybe the base is abstracting a proton leading to some cyclization.

Wait, the starting material has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to the spiro carbon. So, perhaps the base (KH) abstracts a proton alpha to the oxygen. The structure is 1-vinylspiro...en-1-ol, which means the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the vinyl group. So, the structure is a spiro compound with a hydrox
