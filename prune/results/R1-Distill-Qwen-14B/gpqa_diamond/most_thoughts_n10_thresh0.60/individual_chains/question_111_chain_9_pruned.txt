Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down each reaction and see what's going on.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B.

Let's tackle the first reaction first. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me draw this. Position 1 is the carbonyl, so the ring is numbered such that position 1 is adjacent to positions 2 and 6. So the substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). But wait, wait, the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl, so position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group? Because 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Or wait, no—the name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Oh, right. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. So it's a quaternary carbon at C2. Because cyclohexanone is at C1. So the structure would have the carbonyl group at C1. Then C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached, making it a crowded, substituted position. And C6 has a methyl group—so the ring is substituted at positions 2 and 6.

Now, the reaction is with ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this is likely an enolate formation reaction. The ketone can form an enolate, which would then attack the acrylate. Since ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, the reaction is probably a conjugate addition or an aldol addition. But more likely, it's a Michael addition here, because the enolate would attack the alpha position of the acrylate.

Wait, but when the enolate attacks, it would add to the acrylate. Let me think: in the presence of a base, the ketone forms an enolate. The enolate can attack the alpha position of the acrylate ester, which is a good Michael acceptor. So the product would be an addition across the double bond.

But wait, the cyclohexanone's enolate formation would depend on where the base abstracts the proton. So the less substituted position would be more accessible, but in this case, the cyclohexanone has a carbonyl at C1. So the alpha carbons are C2 and perhaps C6? Wait, no, wait—in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. But in this molecule, C2 has substituents (ethyl and methyl), so the alpha protons are at C2 and C6.

But wait, the molecule is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So let me imagine the chair conformation. The carbonyl is at position 1, so C1 is a carbonyl. C2 has a ethyl and a methyl group attached, which probably makes it a bridgehead or similar. Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So C1 is the carbonyl, C2 is adjacent to it, as is C6. So the structure is: C1 is carbonyl, C2 has ethyl and methyl groups, C6 has a methyl, and the rest are CH2 groups or similar.

So when t-BuOK deprotonates, it will take an alpha proton from either C2 or C6. Let's see which is more favorable. The enolate formation is more favorable when the resulting structure is more stabilized. Bulky substituents may influence the position where deprotonation occurs. Since t-BuOK is bulky, it will prefer to abstract the proton from the less hindered position.

Looking at C2: it's already substituted with ethyl and methyl, so any hydrogen there is likely to be more hindered. C6 has a methyl group, so the adjacent C6's proton is perhaps less hindered compared to C2. Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps the enolate forms in a way that the substituents are anti to the leaving group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the enolate could form at C2 or C6. Let's think about the structure. If the enolate forms at C2, then that's the
