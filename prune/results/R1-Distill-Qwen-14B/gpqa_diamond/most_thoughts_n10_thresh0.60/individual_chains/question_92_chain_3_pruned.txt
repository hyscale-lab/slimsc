Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound using bond energies. Let me read it again carefully.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to visualize its structure. It seems like a diene with multiple substituents. Wait, actually, maybe it's a conjugated diene or something with multiple double bonds? No, wait, looking again, there are two double bonds. So the molecule has two C=C bonds.

The problem provides the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and form atoms. For carbon, that's the energy to break a C-C bond, which is given as 200 kJ/mol. Wait, but the problem says that the enthalpy of atomization (which is the same as bond energy) of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, no, the problem says "Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." But then also gives bond energies for C-C, C=C, etc. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing some terms here.

Wait, no, actually, the bond
