Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm... Let's see. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand what the starting material is. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond attached to a CH2 group, I think). So, like, cyclohexane with a CH2-Câ‰¡CH group attached.

The target molecule has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part, which means there's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. Also, there's a substituent on the cyclohexane ring: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that's a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure must be something like a cyclohexane ring with a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl) substituent and an aldehyde group. 

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the numbering must be such that the aldehyde is on carbon 1, and the other substituent is also on carbon 1. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because a carbon can't have two substituents if it's carbonyl. Oh, wait. Wait, maybe the structure is that the cyclohexane has a substituent on carbon 1, which is a methyl group bearing a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. And another substituent, the aldehyde, is on the same carbon? No, that can't be because carbon 1 would have a carbonyl group (aldehyde) which is a double bond, so it can't have more substituents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the target molecule is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde substituted with a cyclohexyl(hydroxymethyl) group. So, the cyclohexane
