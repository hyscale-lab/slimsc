Alright, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound it is among four options. Let me take it step by step.

Okay, the NMR data given is:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

The options are all propenyl or butenyl acetates, and they're either cis or trans. I remember that in acetates, the structure is usually an ester group, like R-O-CO-R'. So the structure would have an ester group, and the rest is the propenyl or butenyl part.

Let's think about the ester groups. The acetate group would typically show up as an OAc group, which in NMR has the methyl group as a singlet. So the 2.1 ppm peak, a singlet of 3H, probably corresponds to the methyl ester (OAc). That makes sense because the methyl in acetate is usually around 2.1 ppm and is a singlet because there's no splitting.

Now, looking at the double bond in the propenyl or butenyl group. The NMR shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm, which is a downfield shift. That suggests it's a vinyl proton. The coupling constant J is 16 Hz, which is quite large. I remember that coupling between vinyl protons (like in alkenes) is usually around 10-18 Hz. So a J of 16 Hz is typical for trans coupling, perhaps? Wait, wait. If it's a doublet, that means each proton is coupling to one other proton. But wait, in a trans arrangement, each vinyl proton would couple with two others, maybe? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the coupling patterns.

Wait, the structure for propenyl would be CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, the doublet at 7.0 ppm is a singlet for a vinyl proton? No, wait, in propenyl groups, the protons on the double bond are split based on their neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. For that, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C3. So the protons on C2 would be next to the double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the splitting. The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests that the proton is coupled to another proton with a large coupling constant. So if it's a vinyl proton, perhaps it's trans to another proton. Wait, in a trans double bond, the two protons are on opposite sides, so their coupling would be trans, which is typically a larger J. So for a trans double bond, the coupling between the two protons is larger.

But wait, the peaks here are for each proton. So for a trans double bond in propenyl acetate, each proton would be coupled to the other. So each would be a doublet with J around 16
