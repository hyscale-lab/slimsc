Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the setup is that we have a single atom of a certain type, and we're monitoring its decay. From previous experiments, we know that the probability of this atom decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. 

Wait, so 32% chance in 100 minutes. Then, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now, we're being asked what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, wait. Wait, no, the next 150 minutes. Wait, but 50 minutes have already passed, so the next 150 would take the total time to 200 minutes. Or wait, maybe the question is about the next 150 minutes from now. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, the question is: So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, so the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and we're looking for the probability of decay in the next 150, which would be from 50 to 200 minutes. But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the remaining time or something else. Let me think about the decay process.

Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the decay follows an exponential probability distribution.
