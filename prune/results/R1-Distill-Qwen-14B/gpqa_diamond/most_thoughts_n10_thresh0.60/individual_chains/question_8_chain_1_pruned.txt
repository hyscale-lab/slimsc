Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about an experiment done on white lupine plants to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key thing they know is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

They tested the mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The resistance levels are given as percentages of the control (wild-type), which is 100%. The results are:

- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

And the question is about the interaction among these genes. The options are A, B, C, D, each making different claims about which gene is a transcription factor, whether there's pleiotropy, redundancy, and epistasis.

First, I need to understand what each term means.

Transcription Factor: A protein that binds to specific DNA sequences, either enhancing or repressing the transcription of genes. If a gene is a transcription factor, it likely regulates other genes.

Pleiotropy: When a single gene affects multiple traits or pathways. But in this context, maybe it's about a gene influencing different downstream genes.

Gene redundancy: When two or more genes can perform the same function; knocking out both doesn't have a more severe effect than knocking out one.

Epistasis: The interaction between genes where the effect of one gene is dependent on another. For example, if Gene A is epistatic to Gene B, then the phenotype of Gene B's mutation depends on the presence of a functional Gene A.

So, in the context of these experiments, the resistance levels indicate how each gene contributes to the disease resistance.

Let's analyze the data. The control has 100% resistance, meaning it's highly resistant. The mutants have varying levels.

Looking at single mutants:
- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild type but not completely susceptible.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So, the gene G2 is critical for resistance. If you knock it out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3:50% → some resistance, but worse than wild type.

Now, the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% → much worse than either single mutant.
- g2g3:0% → same as g2. So, knocking out g2 and g3 doesn't make it any worse than just knocking out g2. Hmm, that suggests that g2's function is upstream of g3, or that g3 doesn't contribute when g2 is knocked out. Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates G3. If G2 is knocked out, G3 isn't expressed, so even if you also knock out G3, it doesn't change the resistance because it's already not contributing.
- g1g2:0% → same as g2. So, knocking out both G1 and G2 leads to complete susceptibility. So, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, or maybe G2 is upstream of G1. If G2 is a transcription factor, and it activates G1, then if G2 is knocked out, G1 wouldn't be expressed either. But wait, in the single mutant g1, resistance is 75%, which is lower than wild type but not zero. So, if G2 is a transcription factor for G1, then in the g2 single mutant, G1 wouldn't be expressed. But in the single mutant g1, G1 is non-functional. So, if the resistance in g2 is 0%, that suggests that G2 is necessary for the function of G1 or for another gene that's necessary for resistance.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the hierarchy. If G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate other genes, perhaps G1 and G3. Let me try to model this.

Case 1: G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3.

In single mutants:
- g2 can't activate any of its targets. So, both G1 and G3 products are not made. If the resistance depends on either G1 or G3 (or both), then knocking out G2 would lead to a severe phenotype.

But the data says that g2 has 0% resistance. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen. That implies that G2's function is essential for resistance.

Then, looking at the single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance → so G1's product alone isn't enough for full resistance, but it contributes. Maybe G1 is one of the downstream targets of G2. If G2 is a TF, and G1 is one of the genes it activates, then in g2, G1 isn't expressed. But in g1, G1 is knocked out, but G2 is functional. So, if G2 is active, perhaps it can activate other genes besides G1, say G3, to contribute to resistance.

Wait, but in single g3, resistance is 50%. So, perhaps G3 is another downstream gene of G2, and when G2 is present, it activates both G1 and G3. So, when G1 is knocked
