Okay, so I need to figure out which of these theories doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite integrals or terms that blow up. It's a way to make these calculations finite and manageable.

Let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different from the usual quantum field theories because it's not just point particles but strings vibrating. I remember that superstring theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that other QFTs do. So maybe superstring theory doesn't need regularization. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think because string theory has a higher-dimensional structure and incorporates gravity, it might avoid some of the issues that lead to divergence, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I know that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free, which means the coupling constant decreases, and quarks behave more freely. But I also remember that loop calculations in QCD can lead to divergences. So they probably use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice methods. So QCD requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I remember that when calculating loop diagrams, especially the electron self-energy or the vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So to handle these, you use techniques like cutoff regularization, Pauli-Villars regularization, or maybe dimensional regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't involve quantum effects, right? So regularization is a quantum field theory concept. In classical E&M, you might have issues with things like the self-energy of a charge, but those are handled differently, perhaps through the use of the retarded potential or other classical methods. Since regularization is a quantum thing, classical theories wouldn't require it. So classical E&M doesn't need regularization at high energies because it's not a quantum theory. 

So putting this together: The question is which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is needed in quantum theories that have divergences. Superstring theory might avoid needing regularization because it's a theory that doesn't have the same divergences. But wait, another thought: I think that in superstring theory, certain aspects like loop corrections
