Okay, so I've got this question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, what's regularization again? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations, making the math messy. Regularization helps make these calculations finite so you can handle them more easily.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the Maxwell's equations and the classical theory of electromagnetism. Right, in classical physics, you don't have the same issues with infinities because there's no concept of renormalization or regularization. Those are quantum and relativistic effects. So in classical E&M, you don't need regularization because you're not dealing with quantum divergences. That might be the answer.

But wait, the question is about high energies. High energies usually mean we're in a regime where quantum effects are significant. So for a theory to not require regularization, maybe it's because it's a classical theory, but wait, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and Superstring Theory are all quantum theories.

Wait, but Classical Electrodynamics isn't a quantum theory. So it doesn't have the same issues as the quantum theories. So in QED, you have processes like electron-positron pair production or vacuum polarization, which can lead to divergences, right
