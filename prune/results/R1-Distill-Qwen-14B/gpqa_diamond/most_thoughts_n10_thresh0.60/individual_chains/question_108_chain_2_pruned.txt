Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian H, with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. They mention that m is small, and B is 1 Tesla. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series wavelength for hydrogen.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that in hydrogen atoms, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the principal quantum number n. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two levels. For example, when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon with energy ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, so the wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I recall is the wavelength of the Balmer-alpha line, corresponding to the transition from n=2 to n=3? Or wait, no, Balmer-alpha is n=3 to n=2, right? Because Balmer series is when the electron transitions into the n=2 level. So the wavelength λ corresponds to a transition between n=3 and n=2. Let me calculate ΔE.

The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n². So the energy difference between n=3 and n=2 would be ΔE = E_2 - E_3. Wait, no, because E_3 is higher (less negative) than E_2. So E_2 is lower than E_3, so the transition from n=3 to n=2 would emit a photon with energy ΔE = E_2 - E_3. Let me compute that.

E_2 = -13.6 / (2²) = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV.
E_3 = -13.6 /9 ≈ -1.511 eV.
So ΔE = (-3.4) - (-1.511) = -1.889 eV. But since energy is emitted, the magnitude is 1.889 eV.

Alternatively, using hc/λ: since hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. So ΔE = 1240 / 486.1 ≈ 2.55 eV? Wait, that doesn't match with the E_n calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, wait. Oh wait, no, because for the
