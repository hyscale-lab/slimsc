Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because the relativistic effects come into play. Right, so I'll need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula for the relative speed, and the relativistic energy equations for the total energy.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. I think the formula for the relative velocity (v_rel) between two objects moving in the same direction is given by (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I'm not sure. Or is it the other way around? Or is it when one is moving in the opposite direction? Let me think. No, wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds divided by that Lorentz factor denominator. So for v_rel, I should use the formula: (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

So, let's compute that. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v1 - v2 is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now, moving on to the total energy of the system. Each astronaut is a relativistic particle, so their energies will be their relativistic energies, which include both kinetic and rest mass energy. The total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's energy.

Wait, no. Wait, in relativity, the total energy of a system is the sum of the total energies of each object. Each object's total energy is gamma * m c². So for each astronaut, we calculate their gamma factor, multiply by their rest mass energy, and add both.

Let me get the details right. The first astronaut has mass 2m and speed 0.6c. So gamma for him is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.36c²/c²))= 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².
