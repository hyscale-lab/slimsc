Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let's see. The question is: a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each giving two energies. 

Wait, first, I should recall what I know about pion decay. I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they usually do so into other particles. In this case, Pi+ decays into mu+ and a neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero, so the total momentum after must also be zero. That means the momentum of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, the pion's rest mass is given as 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? I think neutrinos are considered massless in many problems like this, or at least have a mass that's negligible compared to the other particles. So, the neutrino's energy would be just its kinetic energy, I guess, plus any rest mass energy, but since its mass is zero, maybe it's all kinetic.

Wait, but wait. The pion is at rest, so the total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The decay products are mu+ and nu. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so the remaining energy must go into their kinetic energies.

But how do I calculate the kinetic energies? I think I need to use conservation of energy and momentum. Since momentum is conserved, the vectors must cancel. Let me think about the equations.

So, the pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as -p. 

The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy: E_pi = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. The muon's energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is just |p| c, since its mass is zero.

So, the total energy after is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) + p c.

This must equal the pion's energy: 139.6 MeV.

So, we have the equation:

sqrt( p² c^4 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

Wait, I'm working in units where c=1, so I can ignore it for now. So, the equation becomes sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

I need to solve for p. Let me let x = p. Then:

sqrt(x^
