Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a black hole. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of its entropy. The options are A to D, all around 10^59 to 10^66 J/K.

Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So my first task is probably to find the area A.

The event horizon area A of a black hole is proportional to the square of its Schwarzschild radius. The Schwarzschild radius R_s is given by R_s = 2G M / c². So A = 4π R_s². But maybe I can find R_s from the angular size θ and the distance d.

Wait, angular size θ relates to the actual size. The formula I think is θ ≈ size / distance, when θ is in radians. Oh but the given θ is in degrees, so I'll need to convert that to radians.

Let me calculate the size of the event horizon. The formula is size L ≈ θ (in radians) * d. But wait, that's an approximation valid for small angles. Since θ is 1e-17 degrees, which is really small, that should be okay.

First, convert θ from degrees to radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Plugging in θ_deg = 1e-17, θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that. 1e-17 * 3.1416 ~ 3e-17, divided by 180 is about 1.7e-19 radians.

Now, the size L is approximately θ_rad * d. Wait, but wait, d is given in parsecs. I should convert that to meters because the standard units are in SI units. 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So L ≈ θ_rad * d = 1.7e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m. Let's compute that: 1.7e-19 * 3.0857e26 = approximately 5.2457e7 meters. So the Schwarzschild radius R_s is about half of that, since the event horizon is at R_s. Wait, no: wait no, the size of the event horizon is 2 R_s? No, wait, Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2GM/c². So the event horizon is a sphere of radius R_s, so the diameter would be 2 R_s. Wait no, no, the radius is R_s. So the diameter is 2 R_s. But when we talk about the size as in the linear size (like in the diameter), it's 2 R_s. So if I compute L as the angular diameter, then L = 2 R_s. So, in this case, L = θ_rad * d = 2 R_s.

So R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, perhaps I should re-derive that. Let me think: The angular diameter θ (in radians) is equal to the actual diameter divided by the distance. So θ = (2 R_s) / d. So R_s = (θ * d) / 2.

Wait, that's correct. So R_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

So using the values I have, R_s = (1.7e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m) / 2. Let me compute that. 1.7e-19 * 3.0857e26 = approximately 5.2457e7 m. Divide by 2, R_s is about 2.623e7 meters. So R_s ≈ 2.6e7 m.

Wait, but wait, I thought the event horizon radius is R_s. So the area A is 4 π R_s². Let's compute that. R_s is 2.6e7 m, so R_s squared is (2.6e7)^2 = 6.76e14 m². Multiply by 4 π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈ 12.566. So 12.566 * 6.76e14 ≈ 8.5e15 m².

Wait, but that seems a bit small. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 2.6e7 m is 26,000,000 meters. Squared is (26e6)^2 = 676e12 = 6.76e14 m². Multiply by 4 π: 4 * 3.1416 ~12.566. 12.566 * 6.76e14 = Let's compute 6.76e14 *12.566:

6.76 *12.566 ≈ 84.95, so 84.95e14 = 8.495e15 m². So A ≈ 8.5e15 m².

Hmm, but wait, that seems off. Because for a black hole, the area should be much larger. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I computed R_s = θ_rad * d / 2: θ_rad was 1.7e-19, d is 3.0857e26 m. So 1.7e-19 *3.0857e26 = approximately 5.2457e7 m. Divided by 2 gives 2.623e7 m. So R_s is about 2.6e7 m. Hmm, that's about 26 million meters, which is 26 kilometers. That's a very small black hole, but the question says it's a supermassive one. Wait, maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, supermassive black holes have masses millions to billions of solar masses. The Schwarzschild radius of the Sun is about 3 km. So a million solar masses would have R_s about 3e6 km, which is 3e9 meters. So 2.6e7 m is about 8.5e3 km, which is like 5 solar masses. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I messed up the units. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. 1 parsec is about 3.0857e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters. That's correct.

θ_deg is 1e-17 degrees. Converting to radians: 1 degree is π/180 radians. So 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So θ_rad ≈ 1.75e-19.

So L = θ_rad * d = 1.75e-19 * 3.0857e26 = let's compute that:

1.75e-19 * 3.0857e26 = 1.75 *3.0857e7 = approx 5.39e7 meters.

So 5.39e7 meters is a bit over 53,000 km. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 5e7 meters is 50,000,000 meters, which is 50,000 km. So L is about 5e4 km. Wait, but for a supermassive black hole, the event horizon is much larger.

Wait, perhaps I've inverted the formula. Oh wait, wait. The formula for angular size is θ = size / distance only when the size is much smaller than the distance, which is the case here. So when I have θ in radians, the size L is approximately θ * d. So that would mean L is the diameter of the event horizon.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius R_s is the radius of the event horizon. So the diameter is 2 R_s. So, if I got L = 2 R_s = 5.39e7 m, then R_s is half of that, which is 2.695e7 m. Which is what I did earlier. So R_s is about 2.7e7 m, which is about 27,000 meters, 27 kilometers. But that's way too small for a supermassive black hole. Because, for example, the Schwarzschild radius for the Milky Way's supermassive black hole (about 4 million solar masses) is roughly R_s = 2.95e6 * 4e6 = about 1.2e13 meters, which is 12 million kilometers. Wait, no, let me compute that again.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2 G M / c². For the Sun, M = 2e30 kg, R_s is about 3 km. For 4 million solar masses, M = 8e33 kg. R_s = 2 * 6.67e-11 * 8e33 / (9e16). Let me compute numerator: 2 *6.67e-11 *8e33 = 2 * 6.67*8e22 = 106.72e22 = 1.0672e24. Divide by 9e16: 1.0672e24 /9e16 ≈ 1.185e7 meters, which is about 11,850 meters, 11.85 km. Wait, that's for 4 million solar masses? That can't be right. Wait, I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute R_s again. R_s = 2 G M / c².

G ≈ 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So for M = 4e6 * M_sun, where M_sun is about 2e30 kg, so M = 8e36 kg.

R_s = 2 * 6.6743e-11 * 8e36 / (9e16).

Compute numerator: 2 *6.6743e-11 *8e36 = 2 *6.6743 *8 *1e25 = 106.7888e25 = 1.067888e27.

Denominator: (3e8)^2 =9e16.

So R_s = 1.067888e27 /9e16 = approx 1.1865e10 meters, which is 11.865e9 meters, about 11.865 million meters, or 11,865 kilometers. Oh wait, okay, that makes sense. So a 4 million solar mass black hole has an event horizon radius of about 11.865 million meters. So in our problem, the R_s is 2.7e7 m, which is 27 million meters, which would correspond to M = (R_s * c² )/(2 G).

So M = (R_s * c² )/(2 G) = (2.7e7 m * 9e16 m²/s² )/( 2 *6.67e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Let me compute numerator: 2.7e7 *9e16 = 24.3e23 = 2.43e24.

Denominator: 2 *6.67e-11 = 1.334e-10.

So M = (2.43e24) / (1.334e-10) ) kg.

2.43e24 / 1.334e-10 = (2.43 /1.334) * 1e34 ≈ 1.824 *1e34 kg = 1.824e34 kg.

Convert to solar masses: 1 solar mass is 2e30 kg. So M = 1.824e34 / 2e30 = 9.12e3 solar masses. So that's a medium-sized black hole, not supermassive. Supermassive are millions to billions of solar masses.

Hmm, so something's wrong here. Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial calculation of R_s.

Wait, let me recheck the initial calculation. Given that the angular size is θ =1e-17 degrees, and d=1e10 parsecs.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the size L. Wait, perhaps I should think of the angular size as the visual angle, which for small angles can be approximated as L = θ_rad * d, but when θ is in radians.

Wait, but the event horizon's angular size is given as θ=1e-17 degrees. So the actual diameter is L = 2 R_s.

Wait, but let me recompute θ_rad properly.

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees.

θ_rad = (π/180) * 1e-17 = approximately 1.74533e-19 radians.

Then, L = θ_rad * d = 1.74533e-19 *3.0857e26 m.

So 1.74533e-19 * 3.0857e26 = (1.74533 *3.0857) * 1e7.

1.74533 *3.0857 ≈ 5.39. So ≈5.39e7 meters.

So L = 5.39e7 meters, which is the diameter. So R_s = L /2 = 2.695e7 meters, as before.

Hmm, that's about 27 km, which for a black hole of ~9,000 solar masses. But the problem states it's supermassive, implying much larger. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, could it be that the angular size given is not the diameter but the radius? Or perhaps I got the formula wrong.

Alternative approach: The Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c². The area A = 4 π R_s². The entropy S is (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, perhaps I can express A in terms of the given quantities.

But perhaps I should find M first.

Wait, another approach: If the angular size θ is given, and distance d, then the actual size L is θ * d (in radians). So L = θ_rad * d.

But L is the diameter of the event horizon, which is 2 R_s.

So R_s = (θ_rad * d)/2.

Then, area A =4 π R_s² = 4 π (θ_rad *d /2)^2 = π (θ_rad d)^2.

So A = π (θ_rad d)^2.

Wait, that simplifies things.

So A = π (θ_rad * d )^2.

So let's compute that.

θ_rad was 1.74533e-19 radians.

d = 3.0857e26 m.

Multiply them: 1.74533e-19 *3.0857e26 = 5.39e7 m.

Square that: (5.39e7)^2 = (5.39)^2 *1e14 = 29.05 *1e14 = 2.905e15 m².

Multiply by pi: 2.905e15 *3.1416 ≈9.13e15 m².

So A ≈9.13e15 m².

Wait, that's the area. Now, plug into the entropy formula.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = A c³/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, let me get all the constants' values.

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

G is 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B (Boltzmann constant) is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So compute S = (9.13e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3 ) / (4 * 1.05457e-34 J s * 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * 1.380649e-23 J/K )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: A c³ = 9.13e15 m² * (27e24 m³/s³) )= 9.13e15 * 2.7e25 = let me compute that.

9.13e15 * 2.7e25 = 9.13*2.7=24.651, so 24.651e40 =2.4651e41 m^5/s^3.

Denominator:

4 * ħ * G * k_B =4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Compute each part:

Compute 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 *6.6743e-11 = let's see: 4.21828 *6.6743 ≈28.16, exponents 1e-34 *1e-11=1e-45. So 28.16e-45 =2.816e-44.

Then multiply by 1.380649e-23: 2.816e-44 *1.380649e-23 = 3.898e-67 (because 2.816 *1.3806 ≈3.89, exponents 1e-44 *1e-23=1e-67).

So denominator ≈3.898e-67.

Now, S = (2.4651e41) / (3.898e-67) ) = (2.4651 /3.898) * 1e(41+67) ) = approx 0.632 *1e108 =6.32e107 J/K.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options given (the options are around 1e59 to 1e66). So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recheck.

Wait, let me compute the denominator again.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G * k_B.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³/kg/s².

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

Multiply them:

4 * 1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.38e-23.

Compute step by step:

Compute 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.21828e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11: 4.21828e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.21828 *6.6743) = ~28.16, exponents 1e-34 *1e-11=1e-45. So 28.16e-45 =2.816e-44.

Then multiply by 1.38e-23: 2.816e-44 *1.38e-23 = (2.816 *1.38)= ~3.898, exponents 1e-44 *1e-23=1e-67. So 3.898e-67.

That's correct. So the denominator is 3.898e-67.

Numerator: A c^3 =9.13e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3.

Wait, (3e8)^3 is 27e24 =2.7e25 m³/s³. So 9.13e15 * 2.7e25 = (9.13 *2.7)=24.651, exponents 1e15 *1e25=1e40. So 24.651e40 =2.4651e41.

So S = 2.4651e41 /3.898e-67 = (2.4651/3.898) ) * 1e(41 +67) )= approx 0.632 *1e108 =6.32e107 J/K.

But the options are much lower. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, maybe I messed up the area A calculation.

Wait, I assumed that A =4 π R_s², which is correct. But perhaps I miscalculated R_s.

Wait, let me recheck A.

Wait, I have L = θ_rad * d =5.39e7 m. But wait, L is the diameter of the event horizon, which is 2 R_s, so R_s = L/2 =2.695e7 m.

So A=4 π (2.695e7)^2.

Compute (2.695e7)^2 = approx (2.7e7)^2 =7.29e14 m².

Multiply by 4 π: 4 *3.1416 =12.566. 12.566 *7.29e14 ≈ 9.12e15 m². So A is about 9.12e15 m².

That seems correct. So the calculation of A is right.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for entropy. Let me double-check the formula. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B). So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that entropy is expressed in units of J/K, but I might have messed up the units for other constants. Alternatively, maybe I should use natural units where constants are absorbed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that the entropy is roughly S ≈ (1e40 m²) * (1e30 kg) / (1e-34 J s) → but that approach is vague.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of the numerator.

Wait, compute c^3 again: c =3e8 m/s, so c^3 = (3e8)^3 =27e24 =2.7e25 m³/s³.

So A*c^3 =9.13e15 *2.7e25 =24.65e40 =2.465e41 m^5/s^3.

Denominator: 4 * ħ * G *k_B.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the constants numerically.

Compute denominator:

4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Compute each term:

4 =4.

ħ =1.0545718e-34 J s.

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

k_B=1.380649e-23 J/K.

Multiply all together: 4 *1.0545718e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.380649e-23.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 4 * 1.0545718e-34 =4.2182872e-34.

Multiply by 6.6743e-11:4.2182872e-34 *6.6743e-11 =4.2182872 *6.6743= approx 28.16, exponents 1e-34 *1e-11=1e-45. So 28.16e-45 =2.816e-44.

Multiply by 1.380649e-23:2.816e-44 *1.380649e-23= (2.816 *1.380649)=approx 3.898, exponents 1e-44 *1e-23=1e-67. So 3.898e-67.

So denominator is 3.898e-67.

Wait, that's correct. So S=2.4651e41 /3.898e-67 = 6.32e107 J/K.

But the options are up to 1e66. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that A is 9e15 m² is wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the angular size given is not the diameter but something else. Or perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversions.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the area A in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.

Wait, another approach: Using the formula for entropy in terms of mass.

S = ( ( (12 π G² M² c⁴ )/( ħ²) ) )^(1/2) ) * (1/(k_B)).

Wait, or perhaps S = ( ( (12 π G² M² )/( ħ² c² ) ) )^(1/2) ) * (k_B)^-1.

Wait, I think that's not correct. Let me think in terms of the known formula. The area A is 16 π G² M² / ħ c.

Wait, yes, A = (16 π G² M² )/( ħ c). So, S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G k_B) = [ (16 π G² M² / (ħ c)) * c³ ]/(4 ħ G k_B ) 

Simplify the equation:

S = [16 π G² M² c² ]/(4 ħ G k_B ) 

Which simplifies to S = (4 π G M² c² )/( ħ k_B )

Wait, perhaps that's a better way. So S = (4 π G M² c² )/( ħ k_B )

But I can relate M to R_s, which is R_s = 2 G M / c² → M = R_s c²/(2 G).

So substituting M into the entropy formula:

S = (4 π G ( (R_s c²)/(2 G) )^2 c² )/( ħ k_B )

Simplify:

= (4 π G * (R_s² c^4)/(4 G²) ) * c² )/( ħ k_B )

= (4 π G R_s² c^4 )/(4 G² ) * c² )/( ħ k_B )

Wait, perhaps I should compute step by step.

M = (R_s c²)/(2 G)

So M² = (R_s² c^4)/(4 G²)

So plug into S:

S = (4 π G ( R_s² c^4 / (4 G² )) c² )/( ħ k_B )

= (4 π G * R_s² c^6 / (4 G² )) )/( ħ k_B )

The 4 cancels, and G in numerator and G² in denominator gives 1/G.

So:

S= ( π R_s² c^6 )/( G ħ k_B )

Hmm. Let's compute that.

We have R_s=2.695e7 m.

So R_s² = (2.695e7)^2 ≈7.26e14 m².

c^6 = (3e8)^6 = 729e48 =7.29e50 m^6/s^6.

G =6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

ħ=1.05457e-34 J s.

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So plugging in:

S= ( π *7.26e14 m² *7.29e50 m^6/s^6 ) / (6.6743e-11 m³/kg/s² *1.05457e-34 J s *1.38e-23 J/K )

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:

π *7.26e14 *7.29e50 = π *7.26 *7.29e(14+50) = π *52.93e64 = approx 166.4e64 =1.664e66.

But units: (m²) * (m^6/s^6) ) = m^8/s^6.

Denominator:

6.6743e-11 *1.05457e-34 *1.38e-23.

Multiply constants:6.6743 *1.05457 ≈7.04, then 7.04 *1.38 ≈9.68.

Exponents:1e-11 *1e-34 *1e-23 =1e-68.

So denominator is 9.68e-68 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * J s * J K⁻¹.

Wait, but J is kg m²/s². So let's see:

Denominator units:

G has units m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

ħ has units J s = kg m²/s.

k_B has units J/K = kg m²/s² K.

So denominator units:

(m³/kg/s²) * (kg m²/s) ) * (kg m²/(s² K)) ) 

Multiply them:

m³ * kg m²/s² * kg m²/(s² K) ) / ( kg * s² )

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated, but in any case, the denominator in terms of constants is 9.68e-68.

So S = (1.664e66 m^8/s^6) ) / (9.68e-68 (m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² * kg m²/s * kg m²/(s² K)) )) 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck in the units. Let me focus on the numerical value.

So S = (1.664e66 ) / (9.68e-68 ) = (1.664/9.68) ) * 1e(66+68) ) = approx 0.1718 * 1e134 →1.718e133 J/K.

That's way higher than the options, so something's wrong.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the exponents. Because 1e14 *1e50 is 1e64, right. And 7.26e14 *7.29e50= around 5.3e65? Wait, 7.26e14 is 7.26 *1e14, 7.29e50 is 7.29 *1e50. So 7.26 *7.29 ~53.06, so 53.06e64=5.306e65. Multiply by π: ~16.67e65=1.667e66. So numerator is 1.667e66.

Denominator: 6.6743e-11 *1.05457e-34 = approx 7.04e-45. Then multiply by 1.38e-23: 7.04e-45 *1.38e-23=9.68e-68. So denominator=9.68e-68.

So S = (1.667e66 ) / (9.68e-68 ) = (1.667/9.68) ) *1e(66 +68) = approx 0.172 *1e134 =1.72e133 J/K.

That's way higher than any of the options provided, which are in 1e59 to 1e66. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for S in terms of the event horizon radius. I remember that S ≈ (1e43 m²) * (R_s)^2/(1e13 m^2) ), but that's vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the area in Planck units.

Wait, Planck area is A_p = ħ c / G ≈ 2.612e-70 m².

So area in Planck units is A = A_real / A_p.

So let's compute that.

A_real =9.13e15 m².

A_p =2.612e-70 m².

So A =9.13e15 / 2.612e-70 = 3.495e85.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A)/(4), because S = A/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B c^3)/(ħ G) ?

Wait, no, the formula S = A/(4 l_p^2) * (some constants). Alternatively, I think the entropy is S = (A/(4 l_p²)) * (k_B c^3)/(ħ G).

Wait, perhaps it's better to remember that S is proportional to A/(4 l_p²), where l_p is the Planck length.

So let me compute A in Planck areas.

A =9.13e15 m² / (2.612e-70 m²) ) =3.496e85.

So S = (A/(4 l_p²)) * (something). Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) → same as earlier.

Wait, but that's the same as before. So I think the problem must be that my initial assumption about A is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of A. Let me recheck.

Wait, θ is 1e-17 degrees. Convert to radians: 1 degree= π/180 radians, so θ_rad=1e-17 * π/180 ≈1.7453e-19 radians.

d =1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.0857e16 m =3.0857e26 m.

So the diameter L= θ_rad * d=1.7453e-19 *3.0857e26 =5.39e7 m.

So diameter is 5.39e7 m, radius R_s=2.695e7 m.

Area A=4 π R_s² =4 pi (2.695e7)^2.

Compute 2.695e7 squared: (2.695)^2=7.26, so 7.26e14 m².

Multiply by 4 pi: 4 *3.1416=12.566, 12.566 *7.26e14=9.12e15 m².

So A=9.12e15 m².

Wait, but that's what I did before. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, I think I see the problem. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 3.0857e26 meters, correct. θ is 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad = approx 1.745e-19 radians. So L = θ_rad * d = 5.39e7 m. That's correct.

But perhaps I should compute R_s more accurately.

R_s= L/2=2.695e7 m.

Wait, but if R_s is 2.695e7 m, then the mass is M = R_s c²/(2 G).

Calculating M:

c=3e8 m/s, so c²=9e16 m²/s².

R_s=2.695e7 m.

So M = (2.695e7 m *9e16 m²/s² )/(2 *6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² )

Compute numerator: 2.695e7 *9e16 =2.4255e24 m³/s².

Denominator: 2 *6.6743e-11 =1.33486e-10 m³/kg/s².

So M = (2.4255e24) / (1.33486e-10) ) kg.

2.4255e24 /1.33486e-10 = (2.4255 /1.33486) )e34 =1.818e34 kg.

Convert to solar masses: 1 solar mass is 1.988e30 kg.

So M =1.818e34 /1.988e30 ≈9.15e3 solar masses.

Hmm, that's about 9,150 solar masses. That's a very large stellar-mass black hole, but not supermassive. So the initial assumption that it's supermassive is right, but perhaps my calculation of M is correct, but the entropy is way higher.

Wait, but the options don't match. So perhaps the problem is not about the event horizon's entropy but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of S. Let me check the entropy formula again.

The formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert some constants correctly. Let me recompute S using the area A =9.13e15 m².

So S = (9.13e15 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3 ) / (4 *1.05457e-34 J s *6.6743e-11 m³/kg/s² *1.38e-23 J/K )

Compute numerator:

A c^3 =9.13e15 * (2.7e25) =2.465e41 m² m³/s³ =2.465e41 m^5/s^3.

Denominator:

4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.38e-23.

Compute step by step:

4 *1.05457e-34 =4.218e-34.

4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 =2.816e-44.

2.816e-44 *1.38e-23=3.898e-67.

So denominator is 3.898e-67.

Thus, S =2.465e41 /3.898e-67 =6.32e107 J/K.

But the options are all 1e59 to 1e66. So this can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the denominator.

Wait, 4 *1.05457e-34 =4.218e-34.

Multiply by6.6743e-11:4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11 = (4.218 *6.6743) )e-45 =28.16e-45 =2.816e-44.

Multiply by 1.38e-23:2.816e-44 *1.38e-23= (2.816*1.38) )e-67 =3.898e-67.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area. Alternatively, perhaps the initial angular size is not of the event horizon but something else. But the question says it's the angular size of the event horizon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given θ is the solid angle, not the linear angular size. But that's unlikely because solid angle is in steradians, and the question states θ in degrees, which is a linear measure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula S ≈1.226e43 (R_s in km)^2 J/K.

Wait, I've heard of such a formula before. Let me think.

Wait, I think the entropy can be expressed as S ≈ (1.226e43) * (R_s in kilometers)^2 J/K.

So if R_s is in kilometers, then R_s =2.695e7 m =2.695e4 km.

So R_s^2 = (2.695e4)^2 =7.26e8 km².

So S ≈1.226e43 *7.26e8 = approx 9.0e51 J/K.

Wait, that's 1e52, which is way higher than the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe the formula is S ≈ (1.226e43) * (R_s in meters)^2 J/K.

No, that would give way too large a number.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is S ≈ (1e43) * (R_s in kiloparsecs)^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the Schwarzschild radius in meters and apply the formula correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the formula S = ( ( (12 π G^2 M^2 c^4 )/( ħ^2 ) ) )^(1/2) ) / (k_B).

Wait, perhaps I should compute M first and then plug into this formula.

Earlier, I found M≈9.15e3 solar masses.

M =9.15e3 *1.988e30 kg =1.818e34 kg.

Now, compute S = sqrt(12 pi G² M² c^4 / ħ² ) /k_B.

But perhaps I can compute S numerically.

Compute numerator inside sqrt:

12 * pi * G² * M² * c^4.

Compute each part:

G=6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻².

M=1.818e34 kg.

c=3e8 m/s.

Compute G^2 = (6.6743e-11)^2 ≈4.453e-21 m^6 kg^-2 s^-4.

M^2 = (1.818e34)^2 =3.305e68 kg².

c^4= (3e8)^4=8.1e32 m^16/s^16.

Multiply all together:

12 * pi * (4.453e-21) * (3.305e68) * (8.1e32).

Compute constants: 12 *3.1416 ≈37.699.

37.699 *4.453e-21 =167.7e-21=1.677e-19.

Multiply by 3.305e68:1.677e-19 *3.305e68=5.54e49.

Multiply by8.1e32:5.54e49 *8.1e32=44.9e81=4.49e82.

So numerator inside sqrt is4.49e82.

Denominator inside sqrt is ħ^2 = (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J² s².

So sqrt(numerator/denominator) = sqrt(4.49e82 /1.112e-68 ) )= sqrt(4.04e150) )= ~2.01e75.

Then divide by k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So S=2.01e75 /1.38e-23 =1.457e98 J/K.

Again, way too high. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that the angular size is the diameter. But maybe the angular size is the radius.

If θ is the angular radius, then the diameter would be twice that. So perhaps I should have used L= θ_rad * d as the radius, not the diameter.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me reevaluate.

If the angular size θ is the radius, then L=θ_rad * d is the radius, so the diameter would be 2L. Then R_s = L= θ_rad * d.

So A=4 π L^2.

Wait, let me recalculate.

θ_deg=1e-17 degrees →θ_rad=1.745e-19 radians.

d=3.0857e26 m.

If L=θ_rad *d =1.745e-19 *3.0857e26 =5.39e7 m.

So R_s =5.39e7 m.

Then, A=4 π (5.39e7)^2 =4 *3.1416*(5.39e7)^2.

(5.39e7)^2=2.905e15 m².

Multiply by4 pi: 4*3.1416=12.566. 12.566 *2.905e15 =3.655e16 m².

Wait, A=3.655e16 m².

Now, compute S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

A=3.655e16 m².

c^3=2.7e25 m³/s³.

So A c^3=3.655e16 *2.7e25=9.86e41 m^5/s^3.

Denominator:4 *1.05457e-34 *6.6743e-11 *1.38e-23.

Which is 3.898e-67 as before.

So S=9.86e41 /3.898e-67 = ~2.53e107 J/K.

Still way higher than the options.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. I think I must have made a fundamental mistake in the approach. Maybe I should consider that the angular size is the Einstein radius or something else, but the question clearly states it's the event horizon.

Wait, perhaps the units in entropy formula are wrong. Let me check the formula again.

The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is S = (A c^3) / (4 ħ G k_B).

Wait, but when I plug in the units, they should work out.

A is in m².

c^3 → m³/s³.

ħ is J s = kg m²/s.

G is m³/kg/s².

k_B is J/K = kg m²/s² K.

So the units:

[A c^3] → m² * m³/s³ = m^5/s^3.

Denominator:

[ħ G k_B ] → (kg m²/s) * (m³/kg/s²) ) * (kg m²/(s² K)) ) → let's compute:

kg m²/s * m³/kg/s² = (kg m^5)/(kg s^3) )= m^5/s^3.

Multiply by kg m²/(s² K):

(m^5/s^3) * (kg m²/s² K) ) → kg m^7/s^5 K.

Wait, numerator is m^5/s^3.

So S = (m^5/s^3) / (kg m^7/s^5 K) ) → [1/(kg m² s^-2 K)] → which is K·s²/(kg m²).

But J is kg m²/s², so K·s²/(kg m²) = K/(J). Hmm, that's a problem because entropy should be dimensionless. So perhaps I messed up the units.

Ah, perhaps I missed that k_B is in J/K, so the denominator includes k_B, which has units of J/K. So denominator units are (J s) * (m³/kg/s²) ) * (J/K).

Wait, let me recompute the denominator units.

Denominator is 4 ħ G k_B → units:

ħ: J s = kg m²/s.

G: m³/kg/s².

k_B: J/K = kg m²/s² K.

So multiplying all: (kg m²/s) * (m³/kg/s²) ) * (kg m²/s² K) )

= [ kg m²/s * m³/(kg s²) ) ] * [ kg m²/(s² K) ) ]

First part: (kg m²/s) * (m³/(kg s²)) ) = (m^5)/(s^3).

Then multiply by (kg m²/(s² K)) ) → [ m^5/s^3 ] * [ kg m^2 / (s² K) ) ] = kg m^7/(s^5 K).

But the numerator is A c^3 → m² * m³/s³ = m^5/s^3.

So S has units [ (m^5/s^3) ] / [ kg m^7/(s^5 K) ) ] = (m^5 s^5 K )/(s^3 kg m^7 ) ) = (s^2 K )/(kg m²).

But J is kg m²/s², so s²/(kg m²) = 1/(J). So S has units (K / J) → which is (J/(J K)) ) → 1/K. Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something in the units.

Wait, maybe I should conclude that I'm stuck and perhaps look for a different approach.

Alternative approach: Use the formula for the entropy of a black hole in terms of its diameter.

I remember that the entropy scales with the area of the event horizon, which in turn scales with the square of the diameter (since area is proportional to radius squared).

Given that, perhaps I can find a relation using known values.

For example, the entropy of the Sun is about 1e77 J/K, but the Sun is not a black hole. For a black hole with radius R, the entropy is S = (k_B c^3 A )/(4 ħ G ).

Wait, but without knowing the mass, perhaps it's better to use the relation between the angular size and the entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angular size allows us to compute the entropy without knowing the exact formula by using orders of magnitude.

Let me try to think in exponents.

Given that d=1e10 parsecs =1e10 *3.086e16 m =3.086e26 m.

θ=1e-17 degrees =1e-17 * π/180 ≈1.745e-19 radians.

L = θ * d =1.745e-19 *3.086e26 =5.39e7 m.

Assuming L is the Schwarzschild radius R_s, then A=4 π R_s^2.

So R_s=5.39e7 m. So A=4 π (5.39e7)^2 ≈4 *3.1416 * (2.9e15) )=3.58e16 m².

Now, entropy S = A c^3/(4 ħ G k_B).

Compute each term:

A=3.58e16 m².

c^3= (3e8)^3=2.7e25 m³/s³.

So A c^3=3.58e16 *2.7e25=9.67e41.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G * k_B.

Compute each:

4=4.

ħ=1.05e-34 J s.

G=6.67e-11 m³/kg/s².

k_B=1.38e-23 J/K.

So 4 *1.05e-34=4.2e-34.

4.2e-34 *6.67e-11=2.80e-44.

2.80e-44 *1.38e-23=3.86e-67.

So denominator is 3.86e-67.

So S=9.67e41 /3.86e-67=2.507e107 J/K.

Again, the same result as before, which is way higher than the options.

Wait, but looking back, the options are around 1e59 to 1e66. Let me see the exponents:

My calculation gives S ~1e108 J/K. The options are lower by about 40 orders of magnitude. What could cause such a discrepancy?

Ah! I think I see the mistake. The angular size θ is given as 1e-17 degrees, but I used it as the diameter when I should have used it as the radius, leading to a much larger event horizon and thus a much larger entropy.

Wait, but earlier when I considered θ as the radius, I got S ~2.5e107 J/K, which is still way too big. So perhaps the mistake is that the given angular size is the Einstein radius, not the event horizon. But the question says it's the event horizon.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the formula for the area. Let me check: The area formula uses the Schwarzschild radius, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area in meters. Let me compute A more accurately.

R_s=5.39e7 m.

A=4 pi R_s^2.

R_s^2= (5.39e7)^2 =2.905e15 m².

4 pi =12.566.

So A=12.566 *2.905e15 =3.655e16 m².

Now, compute S= A c^3 / (4 ħ G k_B).

So:

3.655e16 m² * (3e8 m/s)^3 =3.655e16 *2.7e25 =9.86e41.

Denominator:4 *1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 *1.38e-23.

Which is:

4 *1.05e-34 =4.2e-34.

4.2e-34 *6.67e-11=2.80e-44.

2.80e-44 *1.38e-23=3.86e-67.

So S=9.86e41 /3.86e-67=2.557e107 J/K.

Still way higher than the options.

At this point, I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to look for an alternative formula or see if there's a mistake in the initial calculation.

Another approach: Use the relation between angular size and the Schwarzschild radius.

Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2 G M / c².

The angular size θ (in radians) is approximately R_s / d.

Wait, no. Wait, θ ≈ R_s / d, because θ = opposite / adjacent = R_s / d.

Wait, but for small angles, θ ≈ (R_s) / d.

So rearranging, R_s ≈ θ * d.

Wait, that's a different approach. So R_s ≈ θ * d.

So R_s =1.745e-19 rad *3.0857e26 m =5.39e7 m.

Wait, that's the same as before. So the calculation holds.

Hmm, I'm really not seeing where I'm going wrong. All my calculations lead to an entropy way higher than the options, but the question states that the options are around 1e65 or 1e66.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for entropy. Let me check again.

The correct formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

I think I might have missed a factor. Let me check.

Wait, I found a source that states S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use the natural units approach. In natural units, ħ = c = G = k_B =1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use a different formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * (1/k_B), where l_p is the Planck length.

The Planck length l_p = sqrt( ħ G / c^3 ) ≈1.616e-35 m.

So l_p squared is (1.616e-35)^2 ≈2.612e-70 m².

So A/(4 l_p²) =9.13e15 / (4 *2.612e-70 ) )=9.13e15/(1.0448e-69)=8.73e84.

Then, S = (A/(4 l_p²)) * (1/k_B).

But k_B is in J/K. Wait, no, in natural units, the entropy is (A/(4 l_p²)).

But I think I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the entropy is S = (A/(4 l_p^2)) * (c^3)/(ħ G k_B) ).

Wait, I'm not confident. Let's compute it:

A =9.13e15 m².

l_p^2 =2.612e-70 m².

So A/(4 l_p^2 )=9.13e15/(4 *2.612e-70 )=9.13e15/(1.0448e-69 )=8.73e84.

Now, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B).

Which is the same as (A/(4 l_p^2 )) * (c^3)/(ħ G k_B) ) * (l_p^2 / (l_p^2 )).

Wait, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the entropy using the formula S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G).

In that case, same calculation as before.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

The options are:

A) 1e62 J/K

B) 1e59 J/K

C) 1e66 J/K

D) 1e65 J/K

I calculated S≈1e108 J/K, which is way higher than all options. But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the area.

Wait, perhaps the angular size is not the diameter but the radius. So L=θ *d is the radius, not the diameter. So the correct R_s is L=5.39e7 m, making A=4 pi (5.39e7)^2=3.655e16 m². Then, S=3.655e16 * (3e8)^3 / (4 *1e-34 *6.67e-11 *1.38e-23 )= 3.655e16 *2.7e25 / (3.898e-67 ) =9.87e41 /3.898e-67 =2.53e107 J/K. Still too high.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the distance d is in parsecs, and I might have made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, 1 parsec is 3.0857e16 meters, correct. So d=1e10 parsecs is 3.0857e26 meters, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation of the area again.

R_s=5.39e7 m.

A=4 pi R_s^2 =4 *3.1416*(5.39e7)^2.

5.39e7 squared is (5.39)^2=29.05, so 2.905e15 m².

4 pi=12.566.

12.566 *2.905e15=3.655e16 m².

Yes, correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for entropy should include the speed of light in the numerator. Let me check:

S = (A c^3 )/(4 ħ G k_B )

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the constants' product once more.

Denominator:4 * ħ * G *k_B.

Compute:

4 *1.05457e-34 =4.218e-34.

Multiply by6.6743e-11:4.218e-34 *6.6743e-11=2.816e-44.

Multiply by1.38e-23:2.816e-44 *1.38e-23=3.898e-67.

So denominator is 3.898e-67.

Thus, S= (3.655e16 *2.7e25 ) /3.898e-67.

Compute numerator:3.655e16 *2.7e25=9.87e41.

So S=9.87e41 /3.898e-67=2.53e107 J/K.

I'm stuck. Given that, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Maybe using the relation between the angular size and the entropy via the formula for the area.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of A. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the area in square kilometers.

R_s=5.39e7 m=5.39e4 km.

So area A=4 pi (5.39e4 km)^2 =4 *3.1416*(5.39e4)^2 km².

5.39e4 squared is 2.9e9 km².

Multiply by 12.566: 12.566 *2.9e9 =3.65e10 km².

Convert to m²: 1 km² =1e6 m², so A=3.65e10 *1e6 =3.65e16 m². Same as before.

I think I've tried everything, but the entropy remains way too high. I'm probably missing a key insight here. Perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula S ~ (1.2e43) * (R_s in km)^2.

Wait, if I use R_s=5.39e7 m=5.39e4 km, then R_s^2=2.9e9 km².

So S=1.2e43 *2.9e9 =3.48e52 J/K.

That's 1e52, which is still higher than option B (1e59) but lower than options C and D.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S ~ (1.2e43) * (R_s in meters)^2 / (1e15).

Wait, R_s=5.39e7 m.

(5.39e7)^2=2.9e15 m².

So 2.9e15 /1e15=2.9.

S=1.2e43 *2.9=3.48e43 J/K. Way lower than options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S ~ (1e43) * (R_s in parsecs)^2.

R_s =5.39e7 m. 1 parsec is 3.0857e16 m, so R_s in parsecs is 5.39e7 /3.0857e16 ≈1.75e-9 parsecs.

So (1.75e-9)^2=3.06e-18.

S=1e43 *3.06e-18=3.06e25 J/K. Still not matching.

Another approach: Maybe the problem expects to use the relation between entropy and the number of bits, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D) 1e65 J/K. Because when I computed the entropy as 2.5e107 J/K, which is 2.5e107 ~1e107, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the exponents. Let me recompute the denominator:

4 *1.05e-34 *6.67e-11 *1.38e-23.

Compute exponents:

1e-34 *1e-11=1e-45.

1e-45 *1e-23=1e-68.

So 4*1.05 *6.67 *1.38 ≈4 *1.05=4.2; 4.2*6.67=28.01; 28.01*1.38≈38.66.

So denominator=38.66e-68=3.866e-67.

So S=9.87e41 /3.866e-67 =approx 2.556e107 J/K.

Wait, but that's way higher than the options. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation of A.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the angular size θ is the diameter is incorrect. Maybe θ is the radius, so R_s=θ*d.

Wait, but in that case, R_s=5.39e7 m, which gives A=4 pi (5.39e7)^2=3.655e16 m², leading to S=2.5e107 J/K.

Which is still way too high.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should use the formula S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * (k_B c^3)/(ħ G).

Wait, no, that's the same as the original formula.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct approach is to look for an alternative way. Perhaps using the relation S = ( (12 pi G^2 M^2 c^4 )/( ħ^2) )^(1/2) ) / (k_B).

But without knowing M, but knowing R_s, perhaps I can express M in terms of R_s.

M = R_s c²/(2 G).

So M= (5.39e7 m * (9e16 m²/s² )) / (2 *6.67e-11 m³/kg/s² )).

Compute numerator:5.39e7 *9e16=4.851e24 m³/s².

Denominator:2 *6.67e-11=1.334e-10 m³/kg/s².

So M=4.851e24 /1.334e-10 =3.637e34 kg.

Convert to solar masses:3.637e34 kg /1.988e30 kg/M_sun ≈1.83e4 M_sun.

So M≈1.8e4 M_sun.

Now, compute S using the formula S = ( (12 pi G² M² c^4 )/( ħ^2) )^(1/2) ) / (k_B).

Compute numerator inside sqrt:

12 * pi * G^2 * M^2 * c^4.

G=6.67e-11.

G^2=4.45e-21.

M=1.8e4 M_sun=1.8e4 *1.988e30=3.578e34 kg.

M^2=(3.578e34)^2=1.28e69 kg².

c^4=(3e8)^4=8.1e32 m^16/s^16.

So numerator inside sqrt =12 *3.1416 *4.45e-21 *1.28e69 *8.1e32.

Compute step by step:

12 *3.1416≈37.7.

37.7 *4.45e-21=1.674e-19.

1.674e-19 *1.28e69=2.146e50.

2.146e50 *8.1e32=1.737e82.

Denominator inside sqrt= ħ^2= (1.05e-34)^2=1.10e-68.

So sqrt(1.737e82 /1.10e-68 )=sqrt(1.58e150 )=approx 1.257e75.

Divide by k_B=1.38e-23.

S=1.257e75 /1.38e-23=9.11e97 J/K.

Again, way too high.

I'm really stuck. I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach, but I can't figure it out. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B) 1e59 J/K, but I'm not confident.


To determine the order of magnitude of the entropy of the supermassive black hole, we use the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{A c^3}{4 \hbar G k_B}
\]

where \(A\) is the area of the event horizon, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck constant, \(G\) is the gravitational constant, and \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant. The area \(A\) of the event horizon is given by:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2
\]

where \(R_s\) is the Schwarzschild radius, which can be expressed as:

\[
R_s = \frac{\theta \cdot d}{2}
\]

Here, \(\theta = 10^{-17}^\circ\) is the angular size of the event horizon, and \(d = 10^{10}\) parsecs is the distance to the black hole. Converting \(\theta\) to radians:

\[
\theta_{\text{rad}} = \theta \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = 10^{-17} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 1.745 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The Schwarzschild radius is then:

\[
R_s = \frac{\theta_{\text{rad}} \cdot d}{2},
\]

where \(d = 10^{10} \, \text{parsecs} = 10^{10} \cdot 3.0857 \times 10^{16} \, \text{m} = 3.0857 \times 10^{26} \, \text{m}\). Substituting:

\[
R_s = \frac{(1.745 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (3.0857 \times 10^{26})}{2} \approx 2.695 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}.
\]

The area of the event horizon is:

\[
A = 4 \pi R_s^2 = 4 \pi (2.695 \times 10^7)^2 \approx 9.13 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Substituting \(A\) into the entropy formula:

\[
S = \frac{(9.13 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8)^3}{4 \cdot (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.380649 \times 10^{-23})}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
A c^3 = (9.13 \times 10^{15}) \cdot (2.7 \times 10^{25}) = 2.465 \times 10^{41}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
4 \cdot \hbar \cdot G \cdot k_B = 4 \cdot (1.05457 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (6.6743 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (1.380649 \times 10^{-23}),
\]

\[
= 4 \cdot 1.05457 \cdot 6.6743 \cdot 1.380649 \times 10^{-34-11-23} \approx 3.898 \times 10^{-67}.
\]

Finally, compute \(S\):

\[
S = \frac{2.465 \times 10^{41}}{3.898 \times 10^{-67}} \approx 6.32 \times 10^{107} \, \text{J/K}.
\]

This result is far larger than the given options, suggesting a potential error in the interpretation of the angular size \(\theta\). If \(\theta\) represents the radius rather than the diameter, the Schwarzschild radius would be halved, reducing the entropy by a factor of \(1/4\). However, even this adjustment does not bring the entropy into the range of the provided options.

Given the discrepancy, it is possible that the problem expects an approximate calculation or a different interpretation of the angular size. Based on the options and the calculations, the closest order of magnitude for the entropy is:
