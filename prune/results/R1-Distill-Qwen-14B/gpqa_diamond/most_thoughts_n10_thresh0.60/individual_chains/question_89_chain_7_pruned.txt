Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still pretty new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with the solvent.

Hmm, let me try to work out each step. 

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or perhaps dehydrohalogenation. Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe? Or perhaps on carbons that are diagonally opposite? Or maybe on the same face? Wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgehead positions. 

When treated with KOH, probably elimination would occur. Since it's heated, it's likely an E2 mechanism. If two bromines are adjacent, eliminating would form a double bond. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane losing two HBr molecules would form an allene (two double bonds?) or a diene? Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, KOH is more likely to cause elimination than epoxidation. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. 

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. After elimination, the product is 1,3-diketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the product is an epoxide? Wait, but the IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak, like a ketone or ester. So maybe the reaction forms a ketone. Hmm, how?

Wait, KOH in excess and heat. Oh, wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation elimination. Let me think: if you have a dibromide, heating with a strong base can lead to elimination. But the IR has a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone. How can that happen? Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugate elimination. If two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond. But that doesn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide? No, epoxide's carbonyl is around 1200-1300, but 1720 is more like a ketone or maybe an ester.

Wait, maybe it's a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement? Or perhaps some kind of dehydrohalogenation forming a carbonyl. Another thought: maybe the base is causing an elimination, but the structure of adamantane makes it so that when two adjacent Br leave, a double bond forms, but in a cage structure, that might form a bridge with
