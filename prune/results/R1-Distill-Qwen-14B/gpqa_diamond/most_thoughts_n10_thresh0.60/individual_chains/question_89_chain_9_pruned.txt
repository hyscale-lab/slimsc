Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. So KOH would likely cause the two bromine atoms to leave, taking two protons with them, and forming a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bicyclic compound. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings. The 1,3-dibromo would be on adjacent positions in the structure. So elimination would form an adamantene structure with a double bond. But wait, when two vicinal bromides are eliminated, they form an alkene.

The product here is a light yellow solid. The NMR and IR data would help. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. Wait, wait, I thought elimination forms alkenes, but where would the carbonyl come from? Oh wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Maybe it's not elimination but a substitution. But wait, KOH is a strong base and for vicinal dihalides, more likely elimination. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where two bromides are replaced. Wait, but the IR suggests a carbonyl. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a di-elimination forming a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's hydrolysis, but with a strong base?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane heating with KOH. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but wait, where's the carbonyl coming from? Another possibility: perhaps one of the bromides is replaced by an -OH group and the other by another substitution. But that seems unlikely because KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in such a case. Hmm.
