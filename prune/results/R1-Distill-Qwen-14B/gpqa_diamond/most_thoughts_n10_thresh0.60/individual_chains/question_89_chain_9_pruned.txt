Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let's start by breaking it down step by step. 

The question starts with the compound 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is like a cage-like structure. So dibrominated adamantane would have bromine atoms on the 1 and 3 positions. 

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides), it can cause an elimination reaction, forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide, so maybe the reaction isn't just a simple elimination. Alternatively, KOH can also cause substitution reactions. 

Wait, but in some cases, if the dihalide is on a rigid structure like adamantane, perhaps the reaction isn't a straightforward elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but since the positions are 1 and 3, not adjacent, perhaps it's a different reaction. 

Wait, another possibility is that heating with KOH in a high temperature could lead to a neighboring group participation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a ring-opening or forming a bridge. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: looking
