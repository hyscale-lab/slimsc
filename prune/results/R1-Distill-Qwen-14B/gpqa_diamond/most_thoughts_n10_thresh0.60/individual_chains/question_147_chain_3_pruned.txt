Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. The problem says a proton and an antiproton are annihilating to produce two A+ and two A- particles. So, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻.

The question is about finding the velocity of particle A. Oh wait, and they told me that the antiproton is moving slowly. So I guess that means its speed is much lower than the speed of light, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Wait, in particle physics, if something is moving slowly, does that mean its speed is low or its kinetic energy is low? Hmm, but I think in this context, since it's about annihilation, maybe it's referring to the speed being low compared to the speed of light. Or perhaps the kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy. Hmmm.

Wait, but the mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. So each A particle has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², same as the antiproton because they're matter and antimatter.

So the initial system is a proton and antiproton. When they annihilate, they produce four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. So the initial energy and momentum must equal the final energy and momentum.

Wait, but since
