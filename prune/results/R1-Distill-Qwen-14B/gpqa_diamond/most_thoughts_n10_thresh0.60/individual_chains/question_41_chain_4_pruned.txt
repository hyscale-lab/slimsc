Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when things move, you have to consider relativity maybe? Or maybe it's just about the speed of light as always constant. Let me think.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So if the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer, then the glass is moving towards the observer as well. Oh, but wait, the beam is inside the glass. So the glass's movement might affect how the light appears to an outside observer.

Wait, the question asks for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Hmm. Normally, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, here the medium itself is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I recall that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Like, if you're in a train moving at velocity v and you're shining a light inside, the speed of light isn't v + c. Oh wait, no, from the perspective of someone on the train, the light still moves at c. But what about someone outside? The speed of light would still be c in their frame. Wait,
