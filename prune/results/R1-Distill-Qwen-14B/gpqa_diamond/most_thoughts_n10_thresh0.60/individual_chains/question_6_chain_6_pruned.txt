Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about a particle of mass m moving in two dimensions in a specific potential. The potential V(r, θ) is given as (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ. We're supposed to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Hmm. So I remember that in two-dimensional quantum mechanics, especially for central potentials, we often use polar coordinates because of the symmetry. The potential here seems to depend on r and cos²θ, which suggests that it's not purely radial but also has an angular component. Wait, cos²θ can be written in terms of cos(2θ) using a trigonometric identity, right? Because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So maybe that helps in simplifying the potential.

Let me write that down. The potential V(r,θ) can be rewritten as (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Wait, let me compute that correctly. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which is equal to (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. So that becomes (3/4) k r² (1 + cos2θ). So the total potential V(r,θ) becomes (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, simplifying the terms: (1/2 + 3/4) k r² is (5/4)k r², right? Because 1/2 is 2/4, plus 3/4 is 5/4. So V(r,θ) = (5/4) k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ. Hmm, or maybe I should factor out the common terms. So that's (5/4 k r²) [1 + (3/5) cos2θ ]? Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the potential as a sum of terms that can be separated into radial and angular parts. Because in two dimensions, the Hamiltonian for a particle in a central potential would include the radial part and the angular part. Wait, but the presence of the cos2θ term complicates things because it's not purely radial.

Wait, another thought: the potential has a term proportional to cos2θ, which suggests that the symmetry of the problem is such that the potential varies with θ in a way that's not spherically symmetric. So the potential isn't just dependent on r, but also on the angle. That might affect the separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation.

In the regular central potential case without any angular dependence, the problem is solved using polar coordinates, and the radial and angular parts are separated. But here, there's an angular term, which complicates it. So I'm thinking about whether this potential can still be solved using separation of variables, or if the system is such that it can be rewritten in terms of new coordinates or approximated in some way.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of other coordinates, like shifted polar coordinates.
