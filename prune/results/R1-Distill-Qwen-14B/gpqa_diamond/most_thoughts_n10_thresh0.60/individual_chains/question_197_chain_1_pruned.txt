Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product from the given options. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectroscopic information.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should analyze the spectroscopic data to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Let's start with the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe N-H. But looking further, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe a ketone, ester, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 suggest aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but wait. If it's a carboxylic acid, the proton would be around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde. But the integration is 1H, so that's one proton. For a carboxylic acid, that would make sense, but it's also possible for an enol or something else. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm could be the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid. But in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So that might fit.

Looking further, the NMR has:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, probably aromatic protons. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and split into a doublet when coupled with adjacent protons. So if there are two protons in the aromatic region, at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, that suggests substitution on the ring in a para pattern.

Then, 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): another doublet, probably the other set of aromatic protons. So together, these two signals (8.0 and 7.2) could be from a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but wait, if it's a simple para substitution, like a single substituent, then you would only have two protons in total, so maybe a mono-substituted ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring, like two groups in the para positions. But wait, the integration is 2H for each, which totals four aromatic protons. But a benzene ring has six protons. So if two substitu
