Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's when the energy a planet absorbs equals the energy it emits. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσD²))^1/4, but wait, maybe it's tied to the star's temperature and the planet's distance.

Wait, the formula I think is T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) ) * (1 - albedo)^0.25. Or wait, maybe it's T = T_star * ( (R_star/(2a)) )^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25. Because the planet's equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo.

But wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so the albedo terms will cancel out when taking the ratio. That's good because we don't have to worry about that part.

Now, I need to find the ratio T1/T2. So, let me write down the formula for each planet's temperature.

T1 = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a1)) )^0.5 * (1 - A)^0.25. Similarly for T2. Since A is same, when we take T1/T2, the (1 - A) terms will cancel.

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt(R_star/(2a2) ) )

Simplify that: sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )

The R_star and 2 cancel out, so sqrt( a2 / a1 ). So the ratio is sqrt(a2/a1 ). So T1 is proportional to sqrt( a2 / a1 ), wait wait, because sqrt(a2/a1) is sqrt(a2) / sqrt(a1 ). So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So T1 = T2 * sqrt(a2/a1 )

Wait, no. Let me recheck. Let me think: when a planet is farther from the star (a is larger), it should be colder, right? So if a2 > a1, then T2 would be smaller than T1. So if a2 is larger, the ratio T1/T2 would be larger than 1.

Wait, but in our ratio, it's sqrt(a2/a1). Suppose a2 is larger than a1, then the ratio would be greater than 1. So T1 is hotter than T2.

But wait, how do I find a1 and a2? The problem doesn't give the semi-major axes directly. But it gives information using the transit and RV methods. Oh, right! The RV method gives the mass of the planet and the semi-major axis via the Doppler shift.

The RV shift gives the semi-amplitude K, which relates to the planet's mass and the semi-major axis. The formula I remember is K = [ (G * (M_planet) * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ] * (1 / (2π G)) )^(1/
