Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure what the variables are here. Oh, right, fermion fields are ψ_f, and the bar is the Dirac adjoint. The term (ν + X(y)) must be part of the interaction potential. I think ν is the vacuum expectation value, like in the Higgs mechanism. So the interaction is similar to the Yukawa coupling, which is how the Higgs field couples to fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X. So, the decay would be possible only if the sum of the rest masses of the decay products is less than or equal to X's mass.

Wait, but bosons can decay into fermions if the interaction is there. The Lagrangian suggests that X couples to fermions with a coupling strength λ. So the decay of X into fermion-antifermion pairs is possible if the fermions are light enough.

The fermion fields in the Lagrangian are ψ_f. I think f here represents the type of fermion. So the interaction term is -λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f. That would imply that the boson X can decay into two fermions, ψ_f and ψ̄_f. 

Now, the key is to find which fermions have a mass less than half of X's mass, since each fermion in the pair would need to have mass less than or equal to X/2. 

X's mass is 6 GeV, so X/2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): ~1.5 MeV → way under 3 GeV. So u and ū can be produced.
- Down quark (d): ~3-5 MeV → also under 3 GeV. So d and d̄ can be produced.
- Strange quark (s): ~95-105 MeV → definitely under 3 GeV. So s and s̄.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV → still under 3 GeV. So c and c̄.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV → wait, 4.1 is greater than 3 GeV. So b and b̄ can't be produced because each would require at least 4 GeV, but X is 6 GeV. Wait, no, because for a fermion pair, each has mass m. So the
