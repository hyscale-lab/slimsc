Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and finding the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, the question says the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c, and I need to find the energy.

Wait, the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li is lithium. So lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number is 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's lithium-6, right? So the nucleus is ^6Li.

I remember that the energy in particle accelerators is often calculated using the relativistic energy formulas. The energy required would be the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m_0 c². Oh wait, but sometimes it's given as E = gamma * m * c², but m_0 is the rest mass. So I guess I need to calculate gamma first.

But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me compute that. Let me think: v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so v²/c² = 0.9216.

Then 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 1/0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is about 3.5714286.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. But let me double-check that calculation because I might be making a mistake. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) again. 0.28 squared is 0.07
