Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let's see what it says.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. And the nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has an atomic number of 3. But wait, if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6 because the atomic number is 3, and the mass number is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. So the isotope is ^6Li.

So the first thing I think is, I need to find the energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to c, their energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total relativistic energy, which includes their rest mass energy plus kinetic.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that into the formula.

But wait, wait. Wait, the question is about the energy of the collider. I think the energy given would be the kinetic energy, but sometimes people use total energy. Hmm. I need to clarify. The problem states, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c." So I think the RHIC accelerates the ions, so the energy we're looking for is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Or maybe the total? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

In physics, when you talk about the energy of a particle accelerator, it's usually the kinetic energy imparted to the particles. Because the rest mass energy is much smaller than the kinetic, except perhaps for very heavy particles. But let me check. For example, the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) typically states energies as the kinetic energy, but sometimes people refer to it as the total. Hmm.

Wait, no, I think for accelerators, the energy quoted is the kinetic energy. Or is it the total energy including rest mass? Hmm. Let me think again. No, wait, when a particle is accelerated to
