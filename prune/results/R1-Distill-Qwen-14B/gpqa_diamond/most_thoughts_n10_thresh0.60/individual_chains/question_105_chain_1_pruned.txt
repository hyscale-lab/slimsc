Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Hmm, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star is about 1 solar radius, which I think is 696,000 kilometers or something like that. But maybe I don't need the exact number right now.

The star's hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, filling factor... I remember that the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots. So 20% means 0.2 of the surface is spots. But wait, the question says only one hemisphere is covered. Oh wait, noâ€”wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots, but the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Because a hemisphere is half the star, so if the entire surface was covered, it would be 100%. But here, it's 20% of the whole star's surface in one hemisphere. Because 20% of the total surface area would mean 40% of a hemisphere? Not quite sure, but perhaps the exact distribution isn't needed right now.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the star's temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K. Photometric observations show brightness variations as the star rotates, modulating the spots into and out of view. The problem states that this situation can resemble an exoplanet. Interesting, because both would cause dips in brightness when they pass in front of the star.

The question is, to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star wasn't spotted!), what's the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star's radius? So, the idea is, if the star's spots are causing a certain dip in brightness, how big would a planet need to be to cause the same dip.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer. So the dip in brightness would be a bit different compared to a planet blocking the light. Actually, when a planet transits a star, it blocks the starlight, causing a dip. Similarly, when
