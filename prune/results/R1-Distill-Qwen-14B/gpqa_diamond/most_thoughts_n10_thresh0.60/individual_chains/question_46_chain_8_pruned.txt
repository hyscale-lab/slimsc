Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, Grubbs catalyst is involved. I remember that Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is typically a ring-closing or ring-opening catalyst, but in some cases, it can cause cross metathesis if there are other alkenes present.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, pent has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me think. Pent means five carbons. 1-ene is a double bond starting at carbon 1. So structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me count correctly.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a 3-methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

The parent chain is pentene, so five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. At position 3, there's a methyl group. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Hmm, no, wait, because position 3 is where the methyl is attached. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, if it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, the pentene is the main chain with five carb
