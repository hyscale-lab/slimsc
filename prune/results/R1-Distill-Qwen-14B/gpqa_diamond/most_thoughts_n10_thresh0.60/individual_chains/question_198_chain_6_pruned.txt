Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN^- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, wait. What's a stability constant again? Oh right, the stability constant (β) is a measure of the equilibrium between a metal ion and its ligand. A higher β means the complex is more stable. So, βn is the constant for the complex with n ligands attached.

So, the complexes would be Co(SCN)_n^2−n, where n is 1,2,3,4. Each βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of that complex.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands. So that's the Co(SCN)_2 complex. But wait, what's the charge on that? Co^2+ with two SCN^- would be Co(SCN)_2^0? Or maybe Co(SCN)_2^2-? Wait, each SCN is -, so two would make it Co^2+ with two * (-1) = -2. So 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex would be neutral, Co(SCN)_2. But I'm not sure about the charge, but I think for the purpose of this problem, the exact charge might not matter as much as the number of ligands.

So the blue complex is the dithiocyanato, which is the n=2 complex. Wait, but I need to check the options. The answer options are all percentages, so I need to find the fraction of Co in the form of Co(SCN)_2^2- or whatever charge.

Wait,
