Okay, so I have this question about the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds detected using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with this, but let me think through it.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet range, right? Because hydrogen's emission lines are in UV, but when redshifted, they might move into visible wavelengths.

Wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by these hydrogen clouds. So the absorption line we detect is at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms because of redshift. But wait, the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen cloud absorbs some of it. So for us to detect that absorption using an optical telescope, the wavelength must have shifted into the optical range.

Optical telescopes work best in the visible spectrum, which is roughly 400-700 nm or 4000-7000 Angstroms. So the Lyman alpha absorption line needs to be within this range.

The formula I remember for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength)/rest wavelength. Let me write that down:

z = (位_observed - 位_rest) / 位_rest

The rest wavelength here is 1216 Angstroms. We want the observed wavelength to be in the optical range. Let's take the lower end of optical, maybe 4000 Angstroms, but wait, the upper limit is about 700 nm which is 7000 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. Wait 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So the optical range in Angstroms is from 4000 to 7000.

Wait, but wait, no, no, wait. That's not correct. Because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. Wait, no: 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So optical is about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So the observed wavelength 位_obs must be between 4000 and 7000 Angstroms.

Wait
