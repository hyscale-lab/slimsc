Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's spectrum and figuring out its comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And below that, the flux drops a lot. Wait, I remember that the peak of emission in the rest frame might be in the optical, but if it's observed in the near infrared, that suggests redshift. Oh right! If the peak is moving into longer wavelengths, that means the object is moving away, causing redshift.

So, the peak in the rest frame is probably around 550 nm, which is green light. Wait, noâ€”wait, the peak for quasars... wait, actually, maybe I should think about the Lyman-alpha emission line. No, that's for galaxies; quasars have broader lines. Alternatively, maybe it's the Balmer break or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, the peak could be from the accretion disk or some other feature.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. If the rest-frame peak is at, say, 550 nm (like visible light), then the observed wavelength is longer, so redshifted. Let me calculate the redshift.

The formula for redshift is observed wavelength divided by rest wavelength, minus 1. So z = (observed / rest) - 1. Let's assume the rest wavelength is 550 nm (green). So z = 790/
