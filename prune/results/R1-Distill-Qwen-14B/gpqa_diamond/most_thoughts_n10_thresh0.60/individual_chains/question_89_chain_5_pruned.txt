Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see... The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to form product 3. Then, we're supposed to find the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

First, I need to break down each reaction step by step.

The first reaction is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, maybe an E2 mechanism. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure. So 1,3-dibromo would be on opposite positions of the adamantane ring. Hmm, but when KOH is used with vicinal dihalides, it typically leads to elimination, forming an alkene. But if the dihalide is 1,3, which are not adjacent, perhaps it's a different situation. Maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, considering the product is a light yellow solid. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Wait, so maybe the product is an epoxide? Or perhaps a ketone. Wait, no, 1720 is more like an ester or a ketone. If it's a ketone, then maybe the base caused elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on the same adamantane framework. When treated with KOH, perhaps it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But 1,3 positions are not adjacent, so elimination of HBr would only form a bridge or maybe decarboxylate? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another possibility: when two adjacent carbons each have a Br, KOH would eliminate to form a double bond. But in this case, the two Brs are on 1 and 3 positions, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation that forms an epoxide? Or perhaps, since the IR shows a carbony
