Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I remember that Kepler's laws are involved in these kinds of problems. Let me see what the question says.

So there are three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I don't think that method directly affects the orbital period calculation here, so maybe I can ignore that part for now.

The problem gives me the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as approximately 1.4. Also, between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So, Temp1/Temp2 = 1.4, and Temp2/Temp3 = 2.3. Wait, or is it Temp1/Temp2 = 1.4? So Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by a factor of 1.4. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, it's 2.3, so Planet2 is hotter than Planet3 by that factor.

But wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star, right? The formula I remember is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (Luminosity / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and a is the semi-major axis. Since all three planets orbit the same star, their luminosity is the same, so the temperature ratio squared to their distance ratios.

Wait, let me write that down. The equilibrium temperature (Te) is given by:

Te = [ (L / (16πσ)) / (a²) ]^(1/4) 

But since L and σ are constants for the same star, the ratio between two planets' temperatures would be based on their distances. So Te1/Te2 = (a2/a1)^(1/2). Wait, because if a planet is farther away, the temperature would be lower. Because as a increases, Te
