Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The setup is that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics usually involves the work done to bring charges together, right? But in this case, since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that's going to affect things. 

So, the conducting sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the Earth and can have charges flow in or out as needed. I remember that when a conductor is grounded, its potential is zero. So any excess charge on the sphere would be neutralized by the ground.

But wait, if a charge q is placed near the sphere, the sphere will induce charges. Since the sphere is conducting, the charges will redistribute. But because it's grounded, the sphere's potential remains zero. 

Let me think: When you have a charge q outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's induced charges will be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the surrounding. Since it's grounded, the sphere's potential is zero. 

Wait, no, the sphere's surface is at zero potential because it's grounded. So the potential due to the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere must sum up to zero at the sphere's surface.

Let me model this. The sphere has radius R, and the charge q is at a distance d from the center. So, the distance between q and the sphere's surface is (d - R), assuming d is greater than R. Wait, but if d is less than R, the charge would be inside, but I think in this problem, d is the distance from the center, so probably d > R.

But wait, no, I think the problem states that the charge is placed a distance d away from the center, so it's outside the sphere because the sphere has radius R. So d is definitely greater than R. So the charge is outside the conducting sphere.

So when the charge q is placed near the sphere, the induced charges on the sphere will adjust until the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. Because the sphere is a conductor, the charges will distribute on the surface.

So the potential at a point due to multiple charges is the sum of potentials from each charge.

The potential at the sphere's surface due to q, plus the potential due to the induced charges on the sphere, must be zero. Because the sphere is grounded, the surface is at zero potential.

Wait, but the induced charges on the sphere can be treated as a point charge at the center for the purpose of calculating potentials outside the sphere. Because for a conductor, the induced charges produce a field that behaves as if the charge were at the center when outside the conductor.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: For a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges result in the sphere behaving as though there's an image charge inside. Oh right, the method of images. So, the conducting sphere can be thought of as having an image charge -q' at some point inside, so that the potential due to q and q' on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, no. The method of images is used to find the induced charges when
