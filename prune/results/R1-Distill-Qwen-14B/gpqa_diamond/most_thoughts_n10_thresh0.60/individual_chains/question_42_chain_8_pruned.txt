Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're all discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variations. I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But maybe that's not super relevant here. The main focus is on their orbital periods and some ratios.

The problem gives me the equilibrium temperature ratios between the planets. The ratio of Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3. Also, the mass ratios are given: M1/M2 is 1.15, and M2/M3 is 1.35. The question is about the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

All three planets have the same albedo, 0.3, which is similar to Earth's. Albedo affects how much light is reflected, so it plays a role in equilibrium temperature. But since all are the same, maybe it cancels out in the ratios.

I think I need to relate the orbital periods to the given temperature and mass ratios. Hmm. Let's think about what determines the equilibrium temperature of a planet. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = [( (1 - a) * L )/(16 * π * σ * D² ) ]^(1/4 ), where a is albedo, L is star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star (semi-major axis, since it's circular orbit).

But wait, in this problem, we don't know the star's luminosity or the distance. However, we're given the equilibrium temperature ratios. So maybe the ratio of temperatures between two planets can be tied to the ratio of their distances.

Alternatively, since all three planets orbit the same star, the star's luminosity L is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the distance, because T is proportional to (L/(D^2))^(1/4), which is L^(1/4) * D^(-1/2).

Wait, so T is proportional to (L/(D^2))^(1/4) → proportional to (L)^(1/4) * D^(-1/2). But since L is the same for all, T is inversely proportional to D^(1/2).

So T ∝ 1/√D.

So the temperature ratio between two planets is inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances.

Wait, more precisely, T1/T2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 ). Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), so T1 = k / sqrt(D1); T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1).

Given that, let's process the given ratios.

First, T
