Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let's break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the problem starts with Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons and protons is the same. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its analog. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, I need to figure out what Substance X is. Since it's used in organic chemistry as a reagent, I'm thinking of common reagents. One that comes to mind is sodium, but wait, another thought: perhaps X is something like sodium or another metal. But wait, the reaction with a keto acid—maybe it's a base?

Wait, let's think about the reaction X with liquid Y. Violent reaction, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecules have equal protons and neutrons. So, the atom in W must have equal number of protons and neutrons, since the molecule is made of that atom. So possible atoms are maybe hydrogen (1 proton, 1 neutron? No, hydrogen has one proton, but neutrons can be 0,1,2. Wait, if W is H2, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each molecule has 2 atoms of H. But then each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So protons per molecule is 2, neutrons per molecule is 0. Not equal. So that can't be.

Another option: He (helium) gas? But He is a noble gas, doesn't react much. Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, because CO2 has different numbers of protons and neutrons. Or maybe it's an atom that has same number of protons and neutrons, like O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So if the gas is O2, each molecule has 2 atoms. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So for one molecule of O2, total protons would be 16, neutrons 16. So that fits—the number of protons and neutrons are the same.

Wait, but the gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, no, the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has, say, N protons and N neutrons. So for O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each O contributes 8 protons and 8 neutrons to the molecule. So the molecule has (2 atoms)*(8 protons) = 16 protons and (2 atoms)*(8 neutrons) = 16 neutrons. So the total protons and neutrons in the molecule are equal.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3? No, NH3 has different numbers. Or maybe CH4? No, same issue. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, maybe the gas is H2. Because H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So each H in H2 has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So per molecule, 2 protons, 0 neutrons — that doesn't match. So that can't be. 

Alternatively, what about O2 — as I thought before. So if gas W is O2, then the reaction produces O2. So, what reaction produces O2? Maybe a decomposition reaction, or perhaps a metal reacting with acid to release O2? Wait, but when metals react with acids, they usually produce H2, not O2. Alternatively,
