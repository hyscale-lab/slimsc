Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about analyzing a peptidic compound using NMR and LC-MS. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly right, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks are similar in shift and integral. Wait, the integral together is 1H, which is what's expected. So each peak is about half a proton each. Also, they rule out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So it's not splitting due to neighboring protons.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the mass is consistent with the expected molecule. So what's going on here?

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If the crude has a precursor, then the mass would be higher, right? Because the expected molecule is the product, and the precursor is the starting material. But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So the LC-MS would show a higher mass for the precursor. So A might not fit.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so LC-MS would show one peak because they have the same mass. Wait, but sometimes enantiomers can co-elute on some columns, but in high-resolution methods, they might separate. But if the column used is not chiral, the two enantiomers would co-elute, giving a single peak. But the question says two peaks of equal intensity. So that might not be it. Unless the LC-MS is on a chiral column, which would separate them. But the question doesn't specify. Hmm, not sure yet.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' refers to, but I know that in peptide synthesis, sometimes during coupling steps, you can get some side reactions. Like, maybe the amide bond forms incompletely, leading to some alternative structures. But how would that affect NMR? If two different diastereomers form, maybe? Or perhaps something else.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so in NMR, they would show different peaks. But wait, in the NMR, the same alpha-proton is showing
