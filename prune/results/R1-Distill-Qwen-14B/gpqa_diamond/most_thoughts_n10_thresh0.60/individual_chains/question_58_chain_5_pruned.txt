Okay, so I have this physics question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident about all the theories. Let's see what the question is.

The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method so that the results are finite. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have other properties that prevent these divergences.

Let me think about each option. 

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics (Maxwell's equations). Classical theories don't usually have the same issues with infinities because they don't involve the same kind of renormalization as quantum ones. Wait, but wait: in classical electromagnetism, when you have point charges, you can get issues like the infinite self-energy of a charge. Oh yeah, that's a problem. But do we do regularization there? Or is regularization a quantum field theory concept?

Wait, regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So in classical theories, maybe they don't use regularization because the formalism is different. So classical electrodynamics might not require regularization because it's not a quantum theory needing renormalization.

But wait, the question is about when the theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. So let's think about the high-energy behavior of
