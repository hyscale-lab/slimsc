Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which one doesn't need it. Let me think about each option one by one.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It helps make the calculations finite and manageable. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or have properties that prevent such divergences.

Let's start with option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory deals with strings as fundamental particles instead of point particles. String theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that other quantum field theories do. So maybe they don't need regularization. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Do they still use regularization techniques in their calculations? Or is it not necessary because the theory is inherently free from such problems? I'll have to come back to this.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak. But wait, does that mean it doesn't have divergences? No, because regularization is more about handling loop divergences. QCD does require regularization because it's a non-Abelian gauge theory, and loop integrals can still be divergent. So regularization is used here, perhaps through methods like dimensional regularization or Pauli-Villars regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. I know that in QED, there are divergent loop integrals, especially in processes like electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization. That's why renormalization is used, which involves absorbing the divergences into counterterms. But renormalization often goes hand in hand with regularization. So QED definitely requires regularization techniques to handle these infinities.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Oh wait, this is the classical version, not the quantum one. Classical theories don't involve the same infinities as quantum ones because they don't have the same mathematical structure. In classical electromagnetism, you don't have loop diagrams or the same kind of divergences. So maybe classical ED doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. That makes sense. The question is about
