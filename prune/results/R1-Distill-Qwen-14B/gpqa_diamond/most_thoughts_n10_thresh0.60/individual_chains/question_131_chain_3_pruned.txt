Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these types of questions. But let's break it down step by step.

So the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. I remember that dehydration of a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride, and the position of the double bond in the alkene would influence the structure of the anhydride.

The anhydride's NMR data is given. In the 1H NMR, there's a single peak at 7 ppm. That makes me think of something deshielded, maybe an aromatic proton, but wait, the molecule is an anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid. Oh, wait, maybe it's an internal anhydride. Because internal anhydrides can have oxygenated double bonds, which might show up as a singlet in the NMR, but 7 ppm is more like an aromatic proton. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So all the protons in that environment are equivalent and give a singlet. Could it be an aromatic proton? Or maybe an enol tautomer? But wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene. Wait, when you dehydrate a cis-dicarboxylic acid, the anhydride formed would have a trans double bond because the elimination would form a double bond opposite the leaving groups.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So when it's dehydrated (eliminated), the double bond would form, but the geometry would depend on the structure. Wait, when you eliminate two protons from adjacent carbons, the double bond forms, and the stereochemistry of the original double bond (cis or trans) affects the product. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

But moving on. The 13C NMR of the anhydride shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbonyl carbons are usually around 165-220 ppm. So 165 could be a
