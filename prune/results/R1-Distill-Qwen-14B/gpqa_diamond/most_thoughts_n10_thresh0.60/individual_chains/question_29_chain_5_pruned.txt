Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. After sequencing, they found mutations in the first exon. I need to figure out which mutation would probably eliminate the compound.

The intact gene's sequence is given, and there are four mutants. I have to look at each mutant's changes and see which one would disrupt the gene's function.

Hmm, so first, I should probably look at how each mutation changes the DNA sequence. Since the first exon is where all the changes are, I need to see what each change does.

Wait, the question is about getting rid of the anti-nutritional compound. That would likely happen if the gene is nonfunctional. So, the mutation should disrupt the gene's coding sequence, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

In the options, each mutant has a different change. Let me compare each to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact, I think the 5th and 6th nucleotides change. Let's see: the original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT... Wait, the first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So in mutant 1, the sequence is ATG TTCTACGCT... Wait, perhaps I should line them up.

Wait, maybe I should write out the first part of each:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT...
Wait, I think I need to compare each base.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the changes are. The question says the changes are at the beginning of the first exon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The sequence in the first part is ATGTTCTA... Wait, the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCT...

Wait, trying to compare each position:

Intact: 5' ...ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: 5' ...ATG TTC TAC GCT...

Wait, so the first part is:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, so the first few bases are:

Intact: positions 1-21: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1: ATG
