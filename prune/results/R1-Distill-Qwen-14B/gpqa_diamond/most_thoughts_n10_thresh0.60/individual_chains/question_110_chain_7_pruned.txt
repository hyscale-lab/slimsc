Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for things like radial velocity measurements. The question gives some parameters about each star, and I need to figure out which ones are detectable by both instruments.

The problem says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, so apparent V mag ≤17. HIRES can handle stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag ≤16. So a star needs to have an apparent magnitude ≤16 to be seen by HIRES and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh, wait, when it says "brighter than," in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So 'brighter than 17' means apparent V mag less than or equal to 17, right? Because if a star is magnitude 17, it's as bright as the limit. So for ESPRESSO, it's V ≤17. For HIRES, the limit is V ≤16. So a star can be detected by both if its apparent V is ≤16, because that's within both limits. But wait, some stars might have higher
