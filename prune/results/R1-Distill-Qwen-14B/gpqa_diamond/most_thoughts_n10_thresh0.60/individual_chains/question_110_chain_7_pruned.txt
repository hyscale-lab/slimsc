Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question gives me five stars, each with different properties. I need to figure out for each star whether it's observable by both instruments.

First, I should remember the key details about each spectrograph. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. I think it's brighter than, so for ESPRESSO, stars with V mag <=17 can be observed? Or is it magnitude brighter than, meaning higher numbers are fainter. Oh right, the magnitude scale is weird. Lower numbers are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V magnitude is brighter than (i.e., less than or equal to) 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So, for HIRES, the star's V mag must be <=16 to be detected.

Wait, but the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. So, apparent V mag brighter than 17 means apparent V mag <=17. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So ESPRESSO can see up to 17 mag. HIRES can see up to 16 mag.

So each star must have an apparent V magnitude that is less than or equal to 17 (for ESPRESSO) and less than or equal to 16 (for HIRES) to be detected by both. Wait, no. Because to be detected by both, the star must be observable by both. So the star's apparent V mag must satisfy both conditions. So the apparent V mag needs to be <=17 and <=16. So the stricter condition is <=16. So the star's apparent V mag must be <=16.

Wait, that's not correct because each spectrograph has its own limit. For a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V mag must be <=17 (since ESPRESSO can go up to 17), and also <=16 (since HIRES can only go up to 16). So the star's apparent V mag has to be <=16. Because if it's 16.5,
