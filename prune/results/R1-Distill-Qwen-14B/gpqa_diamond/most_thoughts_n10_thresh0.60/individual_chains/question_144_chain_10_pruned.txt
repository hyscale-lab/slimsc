Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I remember from my studies that mesons are subatomic particles, and resonances have to do with their unstable states. The question gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are A to D with some tiny meters.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is related to how far the particle travels before decaying. Since it's a resonance, it's probably an unstable particle, so it doesn't live very long. I remember something about the mean proper lifetime being related to the width. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But I'm not too sure about the exact formula.

Once I have the lifetime τ, I can find the decay distance by multiplying the velocity of the particle (v) by the lifetime. So, the mean decay distance L should be L = v * τ. But wait, L is the distance in the lab frame, so I need to consider the particle's velocity.

But wait, how do I find the velocity v? The particle has a certain energy E, which is given. The mass is m, so the energy is probably the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic energy. The relation between energy, mass, and momentum is E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So I can find the momentum p from that.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the momentum p of the meson X.
   E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²
   So, p = sqrt( (E^2)/(c^2) - m^2 c^2 ) / c²? Wait, maybe I should rearrange it correctly.

Wait, E is given in GeV, and mass m is also in GeV. Oh, but units might complicate things. Maybe better to work in natural units where c=1, but then I have to convert back to meters.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the velocity beta (β) as v/c. Because then v = β c, and τ is the proper lifetime. Then L = v * γ τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, because the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by γ. Wait, no—wait, the proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. In the lab frame, the lifetime is dilated by γ, so the observed lifetime is γ τ. Then the distance is L = v * (γ τ) = β c * γ τ.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The mean proper lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is already given in MeV. Wait, I need to convert units. Because Γ is in energy
