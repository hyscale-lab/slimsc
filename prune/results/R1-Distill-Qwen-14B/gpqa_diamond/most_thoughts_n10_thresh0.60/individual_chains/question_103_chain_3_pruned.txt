Okay, so I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's break down its structure. The phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is a bromo group, and position 5 is a nitro group. Additionally, the ketone group (ethan-1-one) is attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone (R-CO-) group, a bromine, and a nitro group in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring would be at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at the 1-position. So the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions. So benzene has a ketone (like acetophenone), a bromine, and a nitro group in the 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethan-1-one, which is acetophenone-like. So the phenyl has substituents at positions 3 and 5: Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

So the order of adding substituents is important because the positions of the groups depend on the order of substitution. Also, the synthesis has to go through several steps, probably involving substituting groups and directing effects.

Let me recall the directing effects of substituents. Nitro groups are meta directors, and bromine (as a leaving group) is a meta director when attached, but wait, noâ€”I think when bromine is attached as an substituent, it is a meta director. But wait, in the target, the bromine is in the 3 position relative to the ketone (position 1), which is a meta position. The nitro group is in the 5 position, which is also meta. So, perhaps the nitro group is added first, then the bromine, but wait, nitro is a strong meta director. Alternatively, the ket
