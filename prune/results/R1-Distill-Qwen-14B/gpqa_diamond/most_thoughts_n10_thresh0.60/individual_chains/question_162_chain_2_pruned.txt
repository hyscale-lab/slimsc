Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a 2D metric in some coordinates. I remember that in relativity, the metric tensor determines the geometry of the spacetime, but here I think it's a 2-dimensional (since it's dx and dy) metric, so maybe it's describing a 2D surface embedded in some way.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, pseudosphere is a term I'm a little fuzzy on. I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Like, in hyperbolic geometry. But how does that relate to the metric given here?

Let me recall that the metric for a space of constant curvature can be written in terms of some radius. For a sphere, the metric in polar coordinates is something like dr² + (r²) dθ², but for a pseudosphere, which has negative curvature, the metric might look different.

Wait, the given metric is in terms of x and y coordinates. Let me see if I can rewrite it or recognize it. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So that's 4 - (x² + y²) which I can write as 4 - r² where r is the radial coordinate in 2D (r² = x² + y²).

So the metric is ds² = (32 / (4 - r²)) (dx² + dy²). Hmm. Alternatively, I can think of this in terms of radial coordinates. Let me see: if I make a substitution, maybe to polar coordinates (r, θ), then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ².

So substituting that in, the metric becomes ds² = (32 / (4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). That looks more familiar. Now, for a surface of constant curvature, the metric in polar coordinates is usually ds² = dr² + (a² sinh²(r/a))² dθ² for a pseudosphere, where a is the radius of curvature. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, I remember that the metric for a pseudosphere can be expressed as ds² = dr² + (a² sinh
