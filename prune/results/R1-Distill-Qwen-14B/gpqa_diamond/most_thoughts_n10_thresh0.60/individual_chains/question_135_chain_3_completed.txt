Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λff(y)(υ + X(y))ψ̄_f(y)ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I misread that. Let me parse it again. Oh right, it's probably something like -λ times the field f times the Yukawa coupling (maybe υ is the vacuum expectation value, but I'm not entirely sure). But the key thing is that the boson X is interacting with these fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So the question is about the possible decay channels of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion-antifermion pairs.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the energy (i.e., the mass of the boson) must be at least twice the mass of the fermions. Because in decays, the rest mass of the decaying particle must be equal to or larger than the sum of the rest masses of the products. So, X can decay into a pair of fermions f and f-bar only if 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So first, I need to figure out the possible fermions that X can decay into. Let me list the known elementary fermions and their masses (approximate, but in GeV perhaps).

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.005 GeV (but wait, in reality, current quarks are like a few MeV, but constituent quarks are higher. But in terms of decay, it's the current quark mass that matters because that's what appears in the Yukawa coupling. So for u and d, their masses are about a few MeV. So 2m_u is negligible compared to 6 GeV. Similarly for d quarks.

- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV), so 2m_s is 0.2 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into s s-bar.

- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV. 2m_c is 3 GeV. So for X at 6 GeV, 3 GeV is less than 6, so decay into c c-bar is allowed.

- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV. 2m_b is 9 GeV. Oh, wait, 9 GeV is larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 6 < 9. So b quarks are out.

- Top (t): Even heavier, around 173 GeV. So no way.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e is like 0.001 GeV. Definitely allowed.

- Muon (μ): ~0.1 GeV. 2m_mu is 0.2 GeV. Allowed.

- Tau (τ): ~1.77 GeV. 2m_tau is ~3.54 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau pairs.

What about the others like the neutrinos? Well, the Lagrangian given in the problem doesn't show any neutrinos, so perhaps X doesn't interact with them. Or maybe the problem is considering only charged leptons, or perhaps the interaction is only with the fermions present in the Lagrangian.

Wait, the Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ̄_f ψ_f (something). Wait, perhaps f is a scalar field, and X is a boson coupled to ψ_f. So the interaction is Yukawa-type. So ψ_f is a fermion field, and X is a boson. So the decay products would be ψ_f and ψ_f-bar. So it depends on which fermions ψ_f can be.

Wait, the problem statement says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. So the term is L(y) = -λ f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ̄_f (y) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, but maybe it's written differently. Alternatively, the interaction could be something like L = - g ψ̄ ψ X, where g is a coupling constant. So the decay would be X → ψ ψ̄.

So the allowed decays depend on which fermions ψ_f are included in the model. But the problem doesn't specify which fermions are in the theory, except that the Lagrangian has ψ_f. Wait, but the options include various fermions, so perhaps X can decay into any fermion pair as long as the mass condition is met.

Wait, but another possibility is that the interaction is only with the fermion types that have a non-zero coupling. But the question doesn't specify which fermions are allowed. Hmm, maybe the problem is more generic. So X can decay into any fermion pair where the mass is less than 3 GeV each, but wait, no, the mass of X is 6 GeV, so each fermion must be less than 3 GeV.

Wait, no, the fermions' masses need to be such that 2m_f ≤ m_X. So each fermion must have m_f ≤ m_X/2.

So for X=6 GeV, each fermion must be ≤3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

- u, d: ~2-5 MeV → allowed
- s: ~95 MeV → allowed
- c: ~1.5 GeV → allowed
- b: ~4.5 GeV → 4.5 >3 → not allowed
- t: way too heavy → no.

Leptons:
- e: ~0.0005 GeV → allowed
- mu: ~0.1 GeV → allowed
- tau: ~1.77 GeV → allowed.

Wait, but the tau is about 1.77GeV, so 2m_tau is ~3.54 GeV. Which is less than 6 GeV? Wait, 3.54 is less than 6? Yes. So tau can be produced.

Wait, wait, no. Because 2m_f must be ≤ m_X.

Wait, m_X is 6 GeV. So 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So tau is 1.77 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

So, any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be decay products.

So possible fermions:

- u, d, s, c, tau, e, mu.

But looking at the options, the possible decay channels are listed. Let's look at the options.

Option A) X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b has m =4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV, so 2m_b =9 GeV >6 GeV. So this decay is not allowed. So option A includes b which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B) c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c is 1.5 GeV, so yes. Tau is 1.77 GeV, so 2m_tau is ~3.54 GeV <6 GeV. So tau decay is allowed. Wait, but wait, 1.77 *2 is 3.54, which is less than 6, so yes. So tau is allowed. But wait, wait: the calculation for tau is 2 * 1.77 GeV = 3.54 GeV, which is less than X's mass of 6 GeV. So decay into tau pairs is allowed. So option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. But does it include b? No, so B seems correct except perhaps for the c. Wait, c is 1.5 GeV. 2m_c=3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, decay into c c-bar is allowed.

Wait, but wait, looking again: X has m=6 GeV. So the maximum sum is 6 GeV. So each fermion must be ≤3 GeV. So for charged leptons: e (0.0005), mu (0.1), tau (1.77). All good.

Quarks: u, d, s, c. u and d are very light, so allowed. s is 0.1 GeV, c is 1.5 GeV. All allowed. So their pairs can be decay products.

But what about the top quark? No, because its mass is way above 3 GeV.

So the allowed decay channels are all the fermion pairs where each fermion is u, d, s, c, tau, e, mu. But wait, are all these particles present in the Lagrangian? The Lagrangian term given is for some fermion ψ_f. So perhaps the interaction is only with ψ_f, which is a specific fermion.

Wait, but the problem says the interaction is given, but doesn't specify which fermions are included. So perhaps we should assume that X can decay into any possible fermion pairs as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

Wait, another angle: the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays. So kinematics only depends on the mass, not on the interaction strength or whether the coupling exists.

Wait, but wait! No, the interaction has to exist. Because if the fermion doesn't couple to X, then X can't decay into that fermion. So the possible decays are limited to the fermions that are present in the interaction term.

Wait the given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ̄_f (y) ψ_f(y). Hmm, maybe that's a Yukawa coupling. So the interaction term is something like λ f (ῡ + X) ψ̄ ψ. So it's a Yukawa interaction where the scalar field f and the boson X are coupled to the fermion ψ.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The point is that the boson X is coupled to the fermion ψ. So X can decay into ψ and ψ-bar. So what determines which fermions are possible? It's which fermions have a coupling to X.

But since the problem doesn't specify which fermions are in the interaction, perhaps the options are considering the standard model fermions.

Wait, but looking at the options, the possible decay channels are different. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that X can decay into any possible fermion-antifermion pair as long as the mass allows it, assuming that the couplings exist.

But that's not necessarily correct. Because for example, if the Lagrangian only couples X to electrons, then X can only decay into e+ e-.

But the problem states that the interaction is given as that Lagrangian. So perhaps the fermion ψ in the Lagrangian is specific, but the question doesn't tell us which one. So perhaps the problem is not about which fermions are present in the interaction, but about the general case, considering that X can couple to any possible fermion with mass less than 3 GeV. Because the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So perhaps X can interact with any fermion, and the Lagrangian form indicates a Yukawa coupling for any such fermion.

Wait, but the Lagrangian is written for a specific fermion ψ_f. So perhaps X can only decay into that specific fermion and its antiparticle.

But the way the problem is presented is a bit ambiguous. If the Lagrangian is general, perhaps the interaction is with all possible fermions, but considering the problem's options, perhaps it's intended to assume that X can decay into any allowed fermion pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. The interaction term is a Yukawa term implying that X can decay into any fermion pair, provided the mass condition is met.

So, back to the problem. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where each fermion has mass ≤3 GeV.

Which fermions have masses ≤3 GeV? Let's list them:

- u: ~2 MeV → yes
- d: ~3 MeV → yes
- s: ~95 MeV → yes
- c: ~1.5 GeV → yes
- tau: ~1.77 GeV → yes
- e: ~0.0005 GeV → yes
- mu: ~0.1 GeV → yes
- But b is ~4.5 GeV → no, since 2m_b=9 GeV >6 GeV.

So X can decay into any of the fermion pairs: u, d, s, c, tau, e, mu.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all allowed. So B looks correct.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and also top quark. But top is way too heavy, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: includes b, which is incorrect, so D is wrong.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that's all the allowed fermions (except for the exlusion of b and t). So option B is correct.

But wait, another point: the mass of the tau is about 1.77 GeV, so 2m_tau is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, X can decay into tau pairs.

Then, why isn't option C correct? Because option C includes the top quark, which is way too heavy. So C is not allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by a Yukawa-type Lagrangian, and the decays depend on the fermion masses. For a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of the boson must satisfy \( m_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**:  
   The mass of \( X \) is 6 GeV. Therefore, any fermion \( f \) that \( X \) decays into must satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) (since \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

2. **Fermion Masses**:  
   - **Quarks**:  
     - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.  
     - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 3 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.  
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \), allowed.  
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.  
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed (since \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).  
     - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \), not allowed.  
   - **Leptons**:  
     - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.  
     - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed.  
     - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \), allowed (since \( 2m_\tau \sim 3.54 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

3. **Decay Channels**:  
   Based on the above, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion pairs:  
   \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \).  

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed (since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.  
   - **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.  
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed (since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \)). Incorrect.  
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it includes all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV.

Answer: B
