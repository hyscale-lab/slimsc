Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted with a series of reagents. I need to figure out the final product from the options.

First, let's think about the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm. Let's try to interpret this. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe that's an aldehyde group. Or perhaps a carboxylic acid? But no, because that's usually a broad peak around 10-12, but this is a triplet. So aldehyde is more likely.

Then the doublets at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm. Those could be aromatic protons. Let's think: in a para-substituted benzene, you typically get a doublet of doublets, but if there are substituents in the ortho or para positions, the splitting can change. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene. Or perhaps coupled with another aromatic ring.

Looking at the 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests perhaps some exchange, maybe an -OH group? But wait, if it's a singlet, maybe it's two equivalent protons. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with two protons adjacent to an electrondonating group, like an -O- group. Or maybe it's a vinyl group. Wait, but if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an acidic proton like an alcohol.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (3 degrees), a double bond (1), and a ring plus a double bond elsewhere or another ring? Or maybe a benzene ring, a double bond, and an amine. Wait, but the compound is C8H9NO.

Wait, the formula could be something like a benzene ring with substituents. Let's see, perhaps two benzene rings? No, because that would
