Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a standard problem in quantum mechanics, so maybe I can recall some of the concepts.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. The options are A to D, each with different values and numbers.

First, let's think about the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in three dimensions, especially when it's isotropic, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, in 3D, the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

In the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number, say nx, ny, nz. The total energy is given by E = ħω (nx + ny + nz + 3/2), where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = nx + ny + nz. Oh wait, that's right because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω.

So the energy depends on the sum n = nx + ny + nz. Each different set of (nx, ny, nz) with the same sum n gives the same energy. So the energy levels are degenerate, meaning multiple states share the same energy.

Now, the question is about the third excited state. Wait, I have to be careful with the terminology. The ground state is the lowest energy state, which would be n=0, since nx=ny=nz=0. The first excited state would be n=1, the second excited n=2, third excited n=3. So the third excited state corresponds to n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Looking at the
