Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the target molecule.

First, let me sketch the target molecule to visualize it. The benzene ring has three substituents:

1. A tert-butyl group at position 2.
2. An ethoxy group at position 1.
3. A nitro group at position 3.

Wait, but numbering the benzene ring. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. That would mean they are meta to each other? No, wait, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are adjacent to each other. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are in a row. So o-, m-, p-... Hmm, so 1,2,3 would mean the substituents are each adjacent. That's a bit crowded, but I guess that's correct.

Now, let's think about the directing effects of each substituent. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the substituents already present on the ring. Electron-donating groups (like -OEt, ethoxy) are activating and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. Electron-withdrawing groups (like -NO2) are deactivating and meta-directing.

The target molecule has three substituents, so the order in which they're added matters because each new substituent will affect where the next one goes.

Let me plan the synthesis. I need to add tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups to benzene. Let's think about the best order to add them.

1. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Once present, it will affect where other substituents go. Maybe it's better to add this group after some activating groups are in place, so that the nitration doesn't happen at a spot that's too hindered or difficult.

2. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. It's usually introduced via nucleophilic substitution or via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an alkyl halide, but benzene may not directly undergo Friedel-Crafts unless it's activated. Wait, no, benzene can undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation with a Lewis acid catalyst, like AlCl3, to form an alkyl benzene. So maybe ethoxylation can be done via a substitution reaction after activating the ring.

Wait, but wait: Friedel-Crafts alkylation is for adding alkyl groups, but ethoxy is an ether. Oh, wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's more common when the ring is activated (like with nitro groups, but that's deactivating). Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy
