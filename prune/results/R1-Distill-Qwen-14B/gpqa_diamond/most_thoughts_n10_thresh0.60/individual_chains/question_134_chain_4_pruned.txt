Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, right? But wait, the options are given in both kcal and kJ, so I need to be careful about units.

The problem gives me three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are provided. I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are reacting here.

Wait, but wait. When you mix multiple acids and a base, the neutralization depends on the moles of H+ and OH- ions. The reaction between an acid and a base is typically H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat, so it's exothermic. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH-.

So, first, I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let's break it down.

1. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

2. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. Wait, does it dissociate completely in two steps? The first dissociation is complete, giving H+ and HSO4^-; the second gives another H+ and SO4^2-. So, each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M: moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. So H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base: Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base and dissociates completely. Each
