Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle, and I'm supposed to find the oscillation frequency of the z-component of its magnetic moment after the magnetic field changes. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles, like electrons, have their magnetic moments related to their spin. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin in the z-direction. 

The setup is that the magnetic field is initially along the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment would align with the field because that's the lowest energy state. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. Oh wait, so initially the field was along Z, then it switches to Y. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the moment.

I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu·B, right? So when the field is along Z, H is proportional to Sz. But when the field is along Y, H becomes proportional to Sy.

Wait, but the field was turned off and then on again. So the initial state is with the field along Z. When the field is turned off, the particle's spin might not be in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. Because when the field is along Y, the eigenstates are different. So the system will start evolving under the new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The problem says the average of the z-component of the moment starts oscillating. So we're looking at <mu_z> as a function of time. Let me think about how that would behave.

The magnetic moment mu is gamma S, and S is the spin vector. So mu_z is gamma S_z. So the expectation value <mu_z> is gamma <S_z>. The question is about the oscillation frequency of <S_z>, I think.

The time evolution of expectation values in quantum mechanics can be found using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. If the system is initially in an eigenstate of the old Hamiltonian, but the Hamiltonian suddenly changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Initially, the particle is in the ground state of the Z-field. So it's in |+z> state, meaning S_z is ħ/2. Alternatively, if the state is an eigenstate, then S_z is known. But wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so for a spin-1/2, S_z can be ± ħ/2.

2. When the magnetic field is switched to Y, the new Hamiltonian is H' = - gamma B S_y. Because mu is gamma S, and the energy is - mu · B. Since the field is along Y, it's proportional to Sy.

3. The initial state is |+z>, which is not an eigenstate of Sy. So the state will evolve under H'. The time evolution will cause the expectation values of Sx, Sy, and Sz to oscillate.

4. The expectation value <S_z> as a function of time would involve terms oscillating with the energy difference between the states. So we need to find the transition frequencies.

Wait, let me think about the eigenstates and energies. The spin in Y-direction has eigenstates |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The energies are E_± = - gamma B (± ħ/2 ), but the sign might be in the other direction. Hmm, actually, the Hamiltonian is H' = - gamma B S_y. Let me compute that.

S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So H' |+y> = - gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>, and similarly for |-y>. So the energy levels are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ). Or wait, depending on the sign in H', perhaps.

Wait, let me double-check. mu is gamma S, so the interaction energy is U = - mu · B. So H = - mu · B. If B is in Y, then H = - gamma B S_y. So the energies are E = - gamma B (± ħ/2 ), which would be E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ). So the energy difference between the two states is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2 ) - (- gamma B (ħ/2 )) )= gamma B ħ.

Wait, but actually, the energy difference would be E_+ - E_-? Let me think: E_+ is for |+y>, which has Sy = +ħ/2. So E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ). So the difference is E_- - E_+ = (gamma B ħ/2 ) - (- gamma B ħ/2 ) ) = gamma B ħ.

Wait, but in time evolution, the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference. Because the expectation value oscillates as exp( i (E_m - E_n ) t / ħ ), I think. So the frequency would be (E_m - E_n ) / ħ. 

In our case, the initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed as a superposition of |+y> and |-y> states. Let me find the expansion:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Because when you write |+z> in terms of the Y-basis, the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for each.

So the state after the Hamiltonian changes is |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2). Now, under time evolution, each component |+y> and |-y> will acquire a phase factor of exp( -i E_n t / ħ ), where E_n is the energy of that state.

So for |+y>, energy E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), so phase is exp( i (gamma B ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) ) = exp( i gamma B t / 2 )

For |-y>, E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 ), so phase is exp( -i gamma B (ħ/2 ) t / ħ ) ) = exp( -i gamma B t / 2 )

Wait, let me calculate the phase correctly. The time evolution is given by exp( -i H' t / ħ ). So each component's phase is exp( -i E_n t / ħ ). So for |+y>, E_n = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), so phase is exp( i gamma B t (1/2) ), and for |-y>, E_n = gamma B (ħ/2 ), so phase is exp( -i gamma B t (1/2) )

So the state at time t is:

( |+y> exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) + |-y> exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) ) / sqrt(2 )

Now, to find the expectation value of S_z. S_z is diagonal in the Z-basis. Let's express the state in terms of |+z> and |-z> to compute <S_z>.

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute <S_z>, which is (|+z><+z| + |-z><-z| ) / 2? No, wait, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So <S_z> is ( < +z | S_z | psi(t) > + < -z | S_z | psi(t) > ) / sqrt(2) * something. Maybe it's easier to compute the expectation value using the components.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just compute <S_z> in the state |psi(t)>.

The state is |psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2} + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / sqrt(2)

Express this in terms of the Z-basis. Because |+y> and |-y> can be written in the Z-basis.

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting into |psi(t)>:

|psi(t)> = [ (|+z> + |-z>)/sqrt(2) * e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - |-z> )/sqrt(2) * e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out 1/(2) because each term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), and overall, we have (1/sqrt(2)) * [ ... ].

Let me compute:

= [ (|+z> + |-z> ) e^{i gamma B t/2} + (|+z> - |-z> ) e^{-i gamma B t/2} ] / (2)

Grouping terms:

= [ (|+z> (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2} )) + (|-z> (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2} )) ] / 2

Simplify the exponentials:

e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cosθ
e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ

So:

= [ |+z> * 2 cos(gamma B t/2) + |-z> * 2i sin(gamma B t/2) ] / 2

Simplify:

= |+z> cos(gamma B t/2) + i |−z> sin(gamma B t/2 )

So the state |psi(t)> is a superposition of |+z> and |-z> with coefficients cos(θ) and i sin(θ), where θ = gamma B t/2.

Now, the expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = ( < +z | + < -z | ) S_z ( |psi(t)> )

Wait, no. The expectation value is <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

But S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z>, and S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2) |-z>.

So compute <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>:

= [ cos(theta)* < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ] 

Where theta is gamma B t / 2.

Compute each term:

First, the inner products:

S_z |+z> = (ħ/2) |+z> → < +z | S_z |+z> = ħ/2
Similarly, < -z | S_z |+z> = 0.

< +z | S_z | -z> = 0
< -z | S_z | -z> = -ħ/2

So expanding the product:

cos(theta)^2 ( < +z | S_z | +z> ) + cos(theta) i sin(theta) ( < +z | S_z | -z> ) + i sin(theta) cos(theta) ( < -z | S_z | +z> ) + (i sin(theta))^2 ( < -z | S_z | -z> )

Which simplifies to:

cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + 0 + 0 + (i^2 sin^2(theta)) (-ħ/2 )

i squared is -1, so:

= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + ( (-1) (-ħ/2 ) ) sin^2(theta )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ] 

Wait, that can't be right because that would make <S_z> = ħ/2, which is a constant. But the problem says that the average of the z-component starts oscillating, which suggests that my approach is flawed.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating <S_z>. Because the time dependence comes from the phases, but when I calculated the state in terms of |+z> and |-z>, the coefficients have a time dependence. So <S_z> would be:

= [ cos(theta) * (ħ/2) cos(theta) + i sin(theta) * ( - ħ/2 ) (i sin(theta)) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully. Let me write <S_z> as:

<psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)> = [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) | +z > + i sin(theta) | -z > ]

= cos(theta)^2 < +z | S_z | +z > + cos(theta) i sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z > 
+ i sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z > + i^2 sin(theta)^2 < -z | S_z | -z >

Now:

< +z | S_z | +z > = ħ/2
< +z | S_z | -z > = 0
< -z | S_z | +z > = 0
< -z | S_z | -z > = -ħ/2

So:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + 0 + 0 + (i^2) sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

i squared is -1, so:

= ( ħ/2 ) cos^2(theta) + ( (-1) * (-ħ/2 ) ) sin^2(theta )

= ( ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) ) )

= ħ/2 (1) ) = ħ/2

Wait, that can't be right. Then the expectation value of S_z is constant, which contradicts the problem statement that says it starts oscillating. Did I make a mistake in the expansion?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express the state again.

The state after time t is |psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i theta} + |-y> e^{-i theta} ] / sqrt(2), where theta = (gamma B t / 2 )

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

So substituting:

|psi(t)> = [ (|+z> + |-z> ) e^{i theta} + (|+z> - |-z> ) e^{-i theta} ] / (2 )

Grouping terms:

= [ |+z> (e^{i theta} + e^{-i theta}) + |-z> (e^{i theta} - e^{-i theta}) ] / (2 )

Which simplifies to:

= |+z> [ 2 cos(theta) ] / 2 + |-z> [ 2i sin(theta) ] / 2 

= |+z> cos(theta) + i |-z> sin(theta )

So when you take the inner product with < +z | and < -z |, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of S_z correctly.

Wait, let's compute <S_z> more carefully. The expectation value is:

< S_z > = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>

Expressed as:

= [ cos(theta) < +z | + i sin(theta) < -z | ] S_z [ cos(theta) | +z > + i sin(theta) | -z > ]

Calculate each term:

cos(theta) * cos(theta) * < +z | S_z | +z > 
+ cos(theta) * i sin(theta) < +z | S_z | -z > 
+ i sin(theta) cos(theta) < -z | S_z | +z > 
+ i sin(theta) * i sin(theta) < -z | S_z | -z >

As before, the cross terms are zero.

So:

= cos^2(theta) (ħ/2) + (i^2 sin^2(theta)) (- ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ]

Because i squared is -1.

Ah! I see. I made a mistake in the earlier computation. The last term is (i^2) * (- ħ/2 ), so:

= (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + ( (-1) ) ( - ħ/2 ) sin^2(theta )

Wait, no. Let me redo this.

The last term is (i sin(theta))^2 < -z | S_z | -z> 

= (i^2) sin^2(theta) ( - ħ/2 )

= (-1) sin^2(theta) (- ħ/2 )

= (ħ/2 ) sin^2(theta )

So the total becomes:

(ħ/2) cos^2(theta) + (ħ/2) sin^2(theta )

= (ħ/2 ) ( cos^2(theta) + sin^2(theta) )

Which again equals ħ/2. But that can't be right because the expectation value is supposed to oscillate. So where's the mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm missing a part where the phases cause the oscillation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the time dependence in another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value of mu_z, which is gamma S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>. So if <S_z> is oscillating, then so is <mu_z>.

Wait, but according to this, <S_z> is a constant, which would imply <mu_z> is also a constant, which contradicts the problem statement. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Instead of expanding the state, perhaps I should compute the time dependence using the energy eigenstates.

The initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2)

The energies are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

So the time evolution of each component is:

|+y> → e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} |+y> = e^{i (gamma B t/2 ) } |+y>
|-y> → e^{-i E_- t / ħ} |-y> = e^{-i (gamma B t/2 ) } |-y>

So the state at time t is:

|psi(t)> = ( |+y> e^{i gamma B t/2 } + |-y> e^{-i gamma B t/2 } ) / sqrt(2 )

To find <mu_z>, which is gamma <S_z>, let's compute <S_z>:

S_z |+y> = (S_z in Y basis) is zero because |+y> is along Y. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, S_z in the Y basis: |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of S_y, not S_z. So the matrix representation of S_z in the Y basis would have elements that mix |+y> and |-y>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <S_z> using the expectation value in the Y basis.

Wait, but maybe I should compute <S_z> as ( < +z | + < -z | ) S_z ( |psi(t)> )

Alternatively, perhaps another approach using the time-dependent perturbation theory? Or perhaps using the fact that the expectation value oscillates with a frequency given by the energy difference.

Wait, perhaps I can find the equation for <mu_z> as a function of time.

The time evolution of the expectation value is given by:

d< mu_z >/dt = (1/iħ) [ mu_z, H' ]

Wait, because the time derivative of <A> is (1/iħ) < [A, H] >.

So mu_z = gamma S_z, H' = - gamma B S_y

So [ S_z, H' ] = [ S_z, - gamma B S_y ] = - gamma B [ S_z, S_y ]

The commutator [ S_z, S_y ] is i ħ S_x, because [S_i, S_j] = i ħ epsilon_{ijk} S_k

So [ S_z, S_y ] = i ħ S_x

So [ mu_z, H' ] = (gamma) [ S_z, -gamma B S_y ] = gamma ( - gamma B ) [ S_z, S_y ] = - gamma^2 B (i ħ S_x )

So d< mu_z >/dt = (1/iħ) * ( - gamma^2 B i ħ ) < S_x > 

Wait, the i and (-i) would cancel. Because (1/iħ) * ( - gamma^2 B i ħ ) = (1/iħ) * (-i gamma^2 B ħ ) ) 

So:

= (1/i) * (-i gamma^2 B ) 

= (gamma^2 B ) /i * (-i) ?

Wait, let me compute:

(1/iħ) * [ mu_z, H' ] = (1/(iħ)) * ( - gamma^2 B i ħ S_x )

= ( - gamma^2 B i ħ / i ħ ) ) < S_x >

= ( - gamma^2 B ) < S_x > 

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe instead, I should go back to the Heisenberg equations of motion.

In Heisenberg picture, the time derivative of S_z is (1/iħ) [ S_z, H' ]

H' = - gamma B S_y

So [ S_z, H' ] = [ S_z, - gamma B S_y ] = - gamma B [ S_z, S_y ] 

As before, this is - gamma B (i ħ S_x )

So dS_z/dt = (1/iħ) ( - gamma B (i ħ S_x ) )

= (1/iħ ) * (- gamma B i ħ ) S_x 

= ( - gamma B i ħ ) / (i ħ ) ) S_x 

= gamma B S_x 

So dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x 

Similarly, the equation for S_x:

dS_x/dt = (1/iħ) [ S_x, H' ] = (1/iħ) [ S_x, - gamma B S_y ]

= (1/iħ) [ - gamma B ( [S_x, S_y] ) ]

[ S_x, S_y ] = i ħ S_z 

So:

dS_x/dt = (1/iħ) [ - gamma B (i ħ S_z ) ]

= (1/iħ) ( - gamma B i ħ S_z )

= gamma B S_z 

Similarly, dS_y/dt = (1/iħ) [ S_y, H' ] = (1/iħ) [ S_y, - gamma B S_y ] = 0 

So we have the coupled equations:

dS_z/dt = gamma B S_x 
dS_x/dt = gamma B S_z 
dS_y/dt = 0 

These are similar to the equations for a harmonic oscillator. Let me write them in matrix form:

d/dt [ S_x; S_z ] = gamma B [ 0 1; 1 0 ] [ S_x; S_z ]

So the vector [ S_x; S_z ] satisfies a system of ODEs with a rotation matrix. The solution will involve oscillations.

The eigenvalues of the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]] are ±1. The system will oscillate with frequency proportional to gamma B.

Assuming the initial condition is S_x(0) = 0 and S_z(0) = ħ/2 (since initial state is |+z>), let's solve the equations.

Let me define vector V = [ S_x; S_z ]

The equation is dV/dt = gamma B [ 0 1; 1 0 ] V 

The general solution is V(t) = A exp( i gamma B t ) [ 1; i ] + B exp( -i gamma B t ) [ 1; -i ]

Applying initial condition at t=0: V(0) = [ 0; ħ/2 ]

So:

V(0) = [ 0; ħ/2 ] = A [1; i] + B [1; -i ]

So:

A + B = 0 (from first component)
i A - i B = ħ/2  (from second component)

From first equation, B = -A.

Substituting into second equation:

i A - i (-A ) = ħ/2 
i A + i A = ħ/2 
2 i A = ħ/2 
A = ( ħ ) / (4 i ) 

Hmm, but let's compute this.

Wait, 2i A = ħ/2 → A = ( ħ ) / (4 i ) 

But since 1/i = -i, A = ( ħ ) ( -i ) /4 

Similarly, B = -A = ( ħ i ) /4 

So,

V(t) = A [1; i ] exp( i gamma B t ) + B [1; -i ] exp( - i gamma B t )

= ( -i ħ /4 ) [1; i ] exp( i gamma B t ) + ( i ħ /4 ) [1; -i ] exp( -i gamma B t )

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-i ħ/4 ) [1; i ] exp(i gamma B t )

= (-i ħ/4 ) exp( i gamma B t ) [1; i ]

= [ (-i ħ/4 ) exp( i gamma B t ), (-i^2 ħ/4 ) exp( i gamma B t ) ]

Because the second component is (-i)(i) (ħ/4) exp( ...) 

But i^2 = -1, so (-i)(i) = - (i^2) )= 1.

So first term components are:

S_x1(t) = (-i ħ/4 ) exp( i gamma B t )
S_z1(t) = ( ħ/4 ) exp( i gamma B t )

Second term: (i ħ/4 ) [1; -i ] exp( -i gamma B t )

= (i ħ/4 ) exp( -i gamma B t ) [1; -i ]

Components:

S_x2(t) = (i ħ/4 ) exp( -i gamma B t )
S_z2(t) = ( -i^2 ħ/4 ) exp( -i gamma B t )

Again, i^2 = -1, so -i^2 = 1.

So S_z2(t) = ( ħ/4 ) exp( -i gamma B t )

Now, total S_x(t) = S_x1 + S_x2 

= (-i ħ/4 ) exp( i gamma B t ) + (i ħ/4 ) exp( -i gamma B t )

Factor out (i ħ/4 ):

= (i ħ/4 ) [ - exp( i gamma B t ) + exp( -i gamma B t ) ]

= (i ħ/4 ) [ - ( cos(gamma B t) + i sin(gamma B t) ) + ( cos(gamma B t) - i sin(gamma B t) ) ]

= (i ħ/4 ) [ - cos(gamma B t) - i sin(gamma B t) + cos(gamma B t) - i sin(gamma B t) ]

= (i ħ/4 ) [ -2 i sin(gamma B t) ]

= (i ħ/4 ) (-2i ) sin(gamma B t )

= (i * (-2i) ) ( ħ/4 ) sin( ... )

i * (-2i) = -2 i^2 = -2 (-1) = 2.

So S_x(t) = (2 * ħ/4 ) sin(gamma B t )

= ( ħ/2 ) sin(gamma B t )

Similarly, S_z(t) = S_z1 + S_z2 

= ( ħ/4 ) exp( i gamma B t ) + ( ħ/4 ) exp( -i gamma B t )

Factor out ( ħ/4 ):

= ( ħ/4 ) [ exp(i gamma B t) + exp( -i gamma B t ) ]

= ( ħ/4 ) [ 2 cos(gamma B t) ]

= ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

So <S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, that makes sense now. So the expectation value of S_z oscillates with time as cos( gamma B t )

So the frequency of oscillation is gamma B.

But wait, the problem asks about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, which is gamma times S_z. So <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> = gamma ( ħ/2 ) cos(gamma B t )

Wait, but wait a second. The oscillation frequency of <mu_z> would be gamma B. Because the argument of the cosine is gamma B t, so the frequency is gamma B per unit time.

Wait, but the options have gamma B, gamma B/sqrt(2), etc. 

So according to this, the frequency is gamma B, which would be option B.

But wait, looking back at the calculation, the oscillation frequency of <S_z> is gamma B. Then <mu_z> = gamma <S_z> would have the same frequency. 

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Option B.

But wait, wait. Let me think about this again. The system's energy levels have a difference of 2 gamma B ħ/2 = gamma B ħ. So the energy difference is gamma B ħ, leading to a frequency of (energy difference)/ ħ = gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the $+y$ direction, the system evolves under the new Hamiltonian $H' = -\gamma B S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate $|+z\rangle$ of $S_z$. When the magnetic field switches to the $+y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H' = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   After the field is switched, the state evolves as:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y\rangle e^{i\gamma B t/2} + |-y\rangle e^{-i\gamma B t/2} \right).
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, the state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = |+z\rangle \cos(\gamma B t/2) + i|-z\rangle \sin(\gamma B t/2).
   \]

3. **Expectation Value of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$**:  
   The magnetic moment in the $z$ direction is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$. The expectation value $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is proportional to $\langle S_z \rangle$, which oscillates due to the superposition of states. Using the time-evolved state, the expectation value of $S_z$ is:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]
   Therefore, $\langle \mu_z \rangle = \gamma \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\gamma \hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t)$.

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is governed by the cosine term, which oscillates with angular frequency $\gamma B$. Thus, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is $\gamma B$.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of 2.  
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency matches the derived result.  
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2}\gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the oscillation frequency.  
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.
