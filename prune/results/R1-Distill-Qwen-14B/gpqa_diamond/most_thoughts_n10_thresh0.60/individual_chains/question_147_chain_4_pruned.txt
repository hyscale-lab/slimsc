Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with velocities in terms of c.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think this is a conservation of energy and momentum problem. Because in particle physics, when particles annihilate or collide, energy and momentum are conserved.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe it's moving at a non-relativistic speed? Or maybe not, but the velocity is not negligible. But the problem states it's moving slowly, so perhaps we can approximate using non-relativistic equations? Or maybe the proper approach would still be relativistic.

Wait, but the particles produced are A⁺ and A⁻. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. So let's think about the initial and final states.

The initial state is a proton and an antiproton. The proton has charge +e, the antiproton has charge -e. When they annihilate, they produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. So each A must be neutral? Wait, no. Wait, A⁺ is + charge, A⁻ is - charge. So two of each, so overall charge is (2)(+1) + (2)(-1
