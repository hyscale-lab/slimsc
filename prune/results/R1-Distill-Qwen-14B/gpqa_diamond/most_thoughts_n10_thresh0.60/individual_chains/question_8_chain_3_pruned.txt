Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack the question.

Alright, the setup is about an experiment with white lupine plants. They're trying to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. They identified three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others.

The experiment's results show the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type control, which is 100% resistant. Lower percentages mean less resistance. So, the data is:

- g1: 75% (so 75% resistance, which is less than wild type, but not too bad)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

I remember that in genetics, when you have epistatic interactions, the phenotype of a double mutant can tell you about the order of genes in a pathway. If the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that gene is epistatic over the other.

So, let's look at the data. First, looking at g2: it's 0%, completely susceptible. That's a big hit. So, G2's function is crucial for resistance. Then, the double mutants involving g2: both g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%. That suggests that when G2 is knocked out, the other gene's status doesn't matter—the phenotype is the same as when G2 is missing. So G2 is epistatic over both G1 and G3.

Wait, what's epistasis again? Oh right, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the pathway goes A → B. So the function of A is upstream of B. So if knocking out A makes the phenotype worse regardless of B, that suggests that A is upstream.

But wait, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor since its knockout is the most severe, and it's epistatic to others.

Now, looking at G1 and G3 individually. G1 has 75% resistance, so it's worse than wild-type but not as bad as g2. G3 is 50%—so it's worse than G1.

The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either G1 or G3 alone. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops more. That suggests that G1 and G3 are acting in the same pathway. Because if they were in separate pathways, the double mutant might not be as bad as each single mutant. But here, it's worse than either, which is like additive or synergistic effects.

Wait, but how do double mutants with G2 and another gene look? Both g2g3 and g1g2 are 0%. So, when G2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter if another gene is also knocked out—the resistance is gone, same as g2. That suggests G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3, meaning G2's product is needed for their function. So G2 is a transcription factor regulating G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic toward G1. But wait, our data suggests
