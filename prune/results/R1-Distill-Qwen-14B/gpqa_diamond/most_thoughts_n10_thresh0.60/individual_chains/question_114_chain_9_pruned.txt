Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. So the question is about selecting the right reagents for two different reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's typically a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but wait, the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. So maybe it's some kind of substitution or addition reaction followed by something else.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN (which is KCN, or maybe NaCN is the source of CN-) is added, I think the cyanide ion would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the mechanism would be: the carbonyl oxygen becomes an alkoxide, and then the CN- comes in. But wait, that would form (CH3)2C(O-)CN. Then, in acidic conditions, that would protonate to give (CH3)2COH-CN. Wait, that would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me draw it.

Butan-2-one is (CH2CH2)C=O? No, wait
