Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents A and B from the given options. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving A and B as specific reagents.

Let's break each reaction down.

First reaction: Butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a nucleophile. I remember that in ketones, the carbonyl group can undergo nucleophilic addition.

Wait, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxy group. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Normally, adding HCN to a ketone would yield a cyanohydrin. But here, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN (which would supply CN- as the nucleophile) would probably attack the carbonyl carbon. So the cyanide adds to the carbonyl, giving a cyanohydrin. The structure would then be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is (CH3)2-C=O. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's write the structure: the butane chain is four carbons, but it's 2-hydroxy, 2-methyl, and the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxy and methyl groups. So the structure would be CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have four carbons in total. Let me number them. Carbon 1: CH2, carbon 2: C with OH, Me, and the nitrile? Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is on C2, along with the hydroxy and methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the product is (CH(CH3)(OH)CN)CH2CH3? No, that can't be right. Let me think: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Alternatively, the product is (CH3)C(OH)CN
