Alright, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, and each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question is asking about the probability that a particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

Wait, the problem states that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 32%? Or is that the probability that it hasn't decayed? No, wait, the wording says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, the chance that it will decay in 100 minutes is 32%. That should mean that the probability of it not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%, right? Because 100% minus 32% is 68%.

Wait, but radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. So the probability of decay isn't linear with time. It's based on the exponential function. The formula for the probability of decay is P(t) = 1 - e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant and t is time. Alternatively, the survival probability (not decaying) is S(t) = e^(-位t).

But how do we find 位 from the given information? Let's think. We know that in 100 minutes, the probability of decay is 32%. So S(100) =
