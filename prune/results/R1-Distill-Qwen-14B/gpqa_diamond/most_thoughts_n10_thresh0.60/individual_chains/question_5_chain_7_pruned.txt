Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through.

The problem says that the operator is P, and it's along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like spin are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right, because for electrons or muons, the spin matrices are scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the question gives me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices each multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write those down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix, and P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P is a vector operator, and the direction is n in x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) if I'm not mistaken. But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) perhaps? Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane would have θ measured from the z-axis, and φ=0 because it's in the x-z plane, right? So the unit vector n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the operator along n would be P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ, since the y-component doesn't contribute because n_y is zero.

So substituting the components, P·n = (ħ/2)[ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. The (1,1) element is (ħ/2) * cosθ, the (1,2) is (ħ/2)*sinθ, the (2,1) is also (ħ/2)*sinθ, and the (2,2) is -(ħ/2) cosθ.

So the matrix is:

[ (ħ/2 cosθ)   (ħ/2 sinθ) ]
[ (ħ/2 sinθ)   -(ħ/2 cosθ) ]

Wait, but when we're finding eigenvectors, perhaps it's easier to factor out ħ/2 since it's a scalar multiple. So the matrix is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ·n. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, no, wait. The eigenvalue is given as
