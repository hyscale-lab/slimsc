Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a certain nucleus reach a speed of 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and here the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium's atomic number is 3, and if it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, since 3 protons plus 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons in total. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at that speed. 

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a moving object includes its rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. The formula for total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So v is 0.96c here.

Let me break this down step by step. First, I need to find gamma. Let me compute v squared over c squared. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28. Let me calculate that: 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. 1-0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that precisely: 0.28 is 28/100, so reciprocal is 100/28. 100 divided by 28 is approximately 3.571428... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m*c². I remember that the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So I need to find the mass of Li-6 in u.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So the mass of Li-6 should be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665). Let me compute that.

3 protons: 3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828 u
3 neutrons: 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995 u
Total: 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u.

So the mass m is 6.047823 u. Converting that to kg would be m = 6.047823 u * (1.66053906660e-27 kg/u). But wait, maybe I can work in units where c is 1, because when calculating energy, often we use E = gamma m c², and since c is a constant, it's easier to compute in terms of u and then convert to GeV.

Wait, but the atomic mass unit is 931.5 MeV/c². So I can compute the rest mass energy
