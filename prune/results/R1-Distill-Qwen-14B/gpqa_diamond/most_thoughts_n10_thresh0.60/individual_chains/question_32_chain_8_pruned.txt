Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think through this step by step.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li with 3 neutrons... Wait, normal lithium has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Lithium-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which I think is a charged particle. Since it's an ion, maybe it's a Li+ ion, meaning it's lost an electron. So the charge would be +1, but for relativistic calculations, I think the charge doesn't directly affect the energy calculation unless we're considering electromagnetic interactions, which I don't think we are here. So maybe I can ignore the charge for the energy calculation.

Wait, but in colliders, particles are accelerated to high speeds, and the energy is their kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Oh wait, no, actually, in high-energy physics, the total energy includes the rest mass. So the energy of each ion is the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. But sometimes when people talk about the energy of a collider, they refer to the kinetic energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let's proceed with the assumption that the problem is asking for the total energy,
