Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions.

First, let's look at the given molecular formula: C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. Breaking it down: Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees: that could be a ring, a double bond, and maybe some substituents. Maybe a benzene ring with some substituents and an aldehyde group, perhaps?

Now, the NMR data. Let's list out the peaks:

9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a strong signal. High ppm, around 9.7, which is typical for an aldehyde proton (RCHO). But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or maybe a multiplet if coupled with something else. So this could be an aldehyde. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group?

Next peak: 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe from a substituted benzene ring. Next, 6.51 ppm, also a doublet, 2H. Perhaps adjacent to the substituent on the benzene. Then 6.27 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad usually implies exchange or maybe something like an enol or a hydroxyl group, but it's 2H, so maybe it's a conjugated diene or something else.

And then 3.66 ppm, a doublet, 2H. That's probably a methylene group (CH2) next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to something else.

Putting this together. Let me think about the structure.

The aldehyde group (the 9.72 ppm peak) is probably at one end. Then maybe a CH2 group next to it (the 3.66 ppm peak). Wait, but if the aldehyde is at the end, the adjacent would be a CH2, but the triplet would come from being next to another CH2. Hmm, perhaps the aldehyde is at the end of a chain with a CH2-CH2 group?

Wait, but wait. The 3.66 ppm is a doublet of 2H. So that's probably a CH2 group connected to something else. Maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an OCH2 group. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is part of a longer chain. Let me think of a structure like Ph-CH2
