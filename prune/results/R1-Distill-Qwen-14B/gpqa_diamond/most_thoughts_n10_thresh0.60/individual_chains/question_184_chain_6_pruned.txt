Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which sequence of reactions will lead me to the target compound: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break this down.

First, the target molecule. Benzene with substituents: at position 1, there's an ethoxy group; at position 2, a tert-butyl group; and at position 3, a nitro group. So, numbering the benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent to each other in a row. Wait, no, waitâ€”benzene is a ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a meta arrangement? No, actually, wait. If it's 1, 2, 3 substitution, those are adjacent. Wait, no, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 2 and 3 are adjacent, so it's 1,2,3 positions, making a meta arrangement? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 would be in a row, each adjacent. So, the substituents would be ortho to each other in a way. Hmm, maybe it's a para arrangement? Wait, no. Let me think. The numbering is 1,2,3, so that's three substituents next to each other. So the structure would have ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Wait, that's 1,2,3 substituents. So the ring would have substituents at adjacent positions.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So I need to perform a series of electrophilic substitutions. The order in which I add the substituents is important because each substituent directs the next substitution.

Let me think about the directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, tert-butyl groups are bulky and also probably meta directors? Wait, no, wait. The tert-butyl group is an activating group? No, wait: substituents can be activating (like -OEt, which is an electron-donating group) or deactivating. Wait, ethoxy is OEt, which is an activating, ortho/
