Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. Interesting. And when they measured the positions, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but wait. The wave function given here is complex. It's (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So to find the probability density, I need to compute the square of the absolute value of the wave function. The absolute square is ψ*ψ, where ψ* is the complex conjugate.

The complex conjugate of ψ would be (a / sqrt(1 + x)) + 0.5i. So when I multiply them together:

ψ * ψ* = [ (a / sqrt(1+x) ) - 0.5i ] * [ (a / sqrt(1+x) ) + 0.5i ].

Hmm, that's like (p - qi)(p + qi) where p is a / sqrt(1+x) and q is 0.5. So that would be p² + q². Let me compute that.

So p squared is (a²)/(1 +x), and q squared is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the probability density is (a²)/(1 + x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait. Wait a second. That can't be right. Because when you have a complex wavefunction, the modulus squared is the product of the function and its complex conjugate. So yeah, that's correct.

But then the integral of the probability density from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1, because the wave function is normalized. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but that seems a bit odd. Because adding 0.25 to (a^2)/(1+x) would mean that the probability density is a function that's a sum of a term that varies with x and a constant term. So when you integrate that, you'd have to compute two terms: the integral of (a^2)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Let me write that out mathematically. So the integral ∫(from 1 to 3) [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.
