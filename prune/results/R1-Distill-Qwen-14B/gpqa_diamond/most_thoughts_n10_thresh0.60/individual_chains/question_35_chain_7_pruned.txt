Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. So, first, I need to understand what the operator looks like.

The problem states that Ay = c·S, where c = h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So, let me write out S:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Wait, S here looks like it's one of them. Let me think. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Oh wait, S is exactly sigma_y. So S is the Pauli Y matrix.

So, Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Since sigma_y is a Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are known. The eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix are ±1. So, sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times those. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait, wait, no, because the eigenvalues here are real or imaginary? Wait, wait, wait—no. Wait, sigma_y is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be real numbers because c is a real constant and S is Hermitian.

Wait a second, sigma_y is Hermitian because it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Let me check:

sigma_y^† is the conjugate transpose, which would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], but wait
