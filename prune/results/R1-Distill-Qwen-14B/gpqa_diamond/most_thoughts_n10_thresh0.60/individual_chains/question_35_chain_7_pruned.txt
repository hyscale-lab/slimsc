Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, angular momentum... right, that's related to spin. So muons are elementary particles, similar to electrons but heavier. Electrons have spin-1/2, I think muons do too. So their spin operators are 2x2 matrices.

The problem says Ay is a 2x2 matrix and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh, wait, c is h/(4π), which is a constant. And S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So the S matrix looks like:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

Wait, but what's the operator Ay? It's c * S. So let me compute that. c is h/(4π), so multiplying each element of S by c.

So Ay would be [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))], [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ].

I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh, right, eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

Wait, but the question isn't asking me to compute them numerically; it's asking which statement is correct. So I need to think about the properties of Ay and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). Hmm, that's interesting. But wait, Ay is a matrix with real and imaginary components. Let me think about the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix. The general form for eigenvalues of a matrix like [[0, a], [a*, 0]] (where a is a complex number) would have eigenvalues ±|a|, right? Because the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero, and the product is determinant, which is -|a|^2. So eigenvalues are ± sqrt(det), but wait, since the matrix is Hermitian? Wait, no, is Ay
