Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the NMR spectra of the product. Hmm, okay. Let's start breaking it down.

The reaction involves Compound X (C11H12O) reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a type of amine, probably used as a catalyst or maybe in a specific reaction. Oh wait, it's commonly used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Or maybe it's a base in some kind of elimination or ring-opening reaction.

So the product's NMR data is given. Let's look at that.

The 1H NMR has these signals:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

The 13C NMR:
- 21.3 (1C, s)
- 28.4 (1C, s)
- 126.9 (2C, s)
- 127.1 (1C, s)
- 129.1 (2C, s)
- 130.3 (1C, s)
- 141.5 (1C, s)
- 144.1 (1C, s)
- 197.7 (1C, s)

Wait, the 13C NMR has a signal at 197.7. That's a carbonyl carbon, probably. Usually, carbonyls in epoxides are around 130-140 maybe? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, epoxides have two carbons adjacent to the oxygen, but in the product, maybe it's not an epoxide. Or perhaps the reaction forms something else.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo
