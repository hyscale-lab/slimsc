Okay, let's try to work through this question. Hmm, it's about immunology, specifically something related to the adaptive immune response. So I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question describes an experiment where rotavirus inner capsid proteins are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then they observed some fluorescence issuesâ€”like being destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in mucus. But some made it to the secondary lymphoid organs, and they looked at the Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They isolated proliferating cells and sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, finding high variability.

Wait, so the key points here are: oral delivery, the protein is a rotavirus antigen, and after getting to Peyer's patches, the cells are proliferating. The sequencing shows high variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains.

So what processes cause high variability in the variable regions of antibodies? I remember that during the immune response, B cells undergo a process called somatic hypermutation. That's where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes, leading to an increased diversity of antibodies. This process happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, where B cells proliferate and mature.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This directly causes variability in the variable regions. So if they see high variability, this could be the process.

B) Complement activation: That's more about the activation of the complement system, leading to opsonization or lysis of pathogens. Doesn't directly cause variability in B cell receptors.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but doesn't change the variable regions. So it's about isotype switching, not variability in the antigen-binding site.

D) VDJ recombination: This occurs during the initial development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to create the variable region of the heavy chain. But this happens early on, during the formation of the B cell receptor, not during the immune response. So the high variability observed here is more likely due to somatic hypermutation, which happens after the initial VDJ recombination.

So the process here is likely somatic hypermutation. The B cells in the Peyer's patches are undergoing this process to diversify their antibodies, allowing for a more specific response to the rotavirus antigen.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Despite some fluorescence being lost due to stomach acid or mucus entanglement, the fluorescent signals were observed in Peyer's patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The fluorescent cells were isolated, and sequencing of their variable heavy chain genes revealed high variability. This variability is indicative of a process that introduces mutations into the variable regions of immunoglobulin genes, leading to diverse antibody specificities.

Among the options provided:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors during the immune response, increasing the diversity of antibodies. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the activation of the complement system, leading to pathogen opsonization or lysis, but it does not directly cause variability in antibody variable regions.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the antigen-binding site.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region. However, this process happens early in B cell development and does not account for the observed variability during the immune response.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in this experiment is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in germinal centers during the immune response to diversify antibody specificities.

Answer: A
