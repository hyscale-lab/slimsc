Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. I'm a bit new to NMR and organic chemistry, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about analyzing a peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows something unexpected. So, the setup is that after synthesis, the person looks at the NMR, and most of it matches what's expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks look like they're from the same proton because their shifts are similar and together they add up to 1H. So, each has about 0.5H? That doesn't make sense because each proton should only show once. 

Wait, but the integral together is 1H, which is correct. So each peak is 0.5H. Hmm, but why two peaks? The question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out because of the coupling pattern. So it's not splitting due to neighboring protons. What else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the mass spec is the same, meaning same molecular weight. But two peaks, so maybe two different compounds with the same molecular weight? Or perhaps impurities that have the same mass but different structures. Or perhaps it's something else like diastereomers or enantiomers.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. If the precursor is present, it would have a different molecular weight. But the mass spectrum is same, so probably not. Unless the precursor lost something, but LC-MS at elevated temp—maybe the precursor decomposes? Not sure.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so mass spec would match. In LC-MS, would they elute at different times? Because enantiomers are not chiral, wait no—wait, enantiomers are chiral, but how does that affect LC? It depends on the chromatography. If it's a chiral column, they might separate, but if the column is achiral, enantiomers might elute together. But the question says two peaks of equal intensities. So maybe they are separated. But how? Because enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images, their retention times might be same or different. I'm not too sure. Also, in NMR, enantiomers would have the same spectrum, but wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Wait, no, enantiomers would give the same 1H NMR because they're mirror images. So if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR should look the same as the pure compound. So the NMR shouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So maybe B is not correct, unless there's something else I'm missing.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, what's that? Oh, wait, maybe during the formation of the amide, like when using DCC or HATU, sometimes you can get double couplings, but not sure. Or perhaps during the reaction, a coupling reaction leads to some byproducts. But I'm not sure how that would lead to two peaks in NMR and two peaks in LC-MS. Or maybe it's something about the amide protons, but the question says it's the alpha-proton, so probably adjacent to the carbonyl. Wait, alpha protons are typically in regions around 3-4 ppm. So if two peaks appear, maybe they are diastereotopic? Or maybe some splitting due to coupling with two different groups, but the question said spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So C might not be the right answer.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would show up as separate peaks in LC-MS. Their mass would be the same, but since they're different structures, but wait, no, if they are diastereomers, their structures are different, so their mass would be same only if they have the same molecular formula. Oh, diastereomers have the same molecular formula but different connectivity. So in LC-MS, same mass, so they would have the same mass spec. So the two peaks in LC-MS would be the two diastereomers. Now, for the NMR, diastereomers would have different NMR spectra. But wait, the question says the NMR is consistent except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. So if there are two diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons. But the integral adds up to 1H. Wait, perhaps both diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment, leading to two peaks each integrating to 0.5H. But that's getting complicated.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So perhaps each diastereomer has the same alpha proton. Wait, but if the diastereomers are different in configuration, the alpha proton might be split differently. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton shift, leading to two peaks each integrating 0.5 H, but why the same shift? Maybe they're in equivalent environments. Not sure.

Wait, let's think again. The NMR shows for the same alpha proton, two peaks. Why? If the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show two peaks because enantiomers have the same NMR signals. So that can't be it. But what if it's a diastereomer mixture?

Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would have different NMR shifts. But in this question, the two peaks have similar shifts. So maybe the diastereomers have the same shift for that alpha proton? That seems unlikely unless the environment is same. Or perhaps the diastereomers are such that the alpha protons are in equivalent environments, leading to same shift. Like, for instance, if the diastereomers have the same substituents around the alpha carbon, so the protons are in the same environment. So each diastereomer contributes a peak, but both are same shift, so you get two peaks each integrating 0.5 H.

But wait, if the diastereomers are present as a 1:1 mixture, then each would contribute their own set of peaks. But in this case, the question says that the rest of the spectrum is consistent, only the alpha proton has two peaks. So perhaps the diastereomers are such that all other protons are the same, only the alpha is different? No, the NMR is consistent with expected, except for these two peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers are enantiomers of each other but that would make them enantiomers, not diastereomers. No, diastereomers are not mirror images.

Wait, but the options: B is enantiomers, D is diastereomers. So what's the scenario.

In the case of diastereomers, their NMR spectra would differ. So if the sample is a mixture, the NMR would be a combination of two different sets of peaks. But the question says that the NMR looks consistent except for two peaks that are duplicates. So for all other protons, their signals are as expected, but the alpha has two peaks.

So if the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment, each would contribute a peak. So the integral is 1H, each peak is 0.5. But why would the diastereomers have the same shift for the alpha proton? Maybe the substituents are in a way that the environment is same. For example, perhaps the substituents around the alpha carbon are same in both diastereomers, making the chemical shift same for that proton.

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers are actually constitutional isomers or something else. But I think constitutional isomers would have different molecular weights, so their mass spec would differ. So the question says same mass, so same molecular formula.

Wait, the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of same intensity and same mass. So same molecular weight, which suggests same molecular formula. So the two compounds in the mixture must be constitutional isomers or stereoisomers (enantiomers or diastereomers).

But enantiomers would have same NMR, so the NMR would not show two peaks for the same proton. So more likely diastereomers.

But why would diastereomers have same alpha-proton shift? Maybe the diastereomers have the same local environment for that proton. For example, if they're epimers, where only one stereocenter differs, and that stereocenter is not on the alpha carbon. So the alpha carbon's environment is same in both, leading to same shift. So the two diastereomers would each have the same alpha proton shift, hence two peaks, each integrating 0.5.

Wait, but in that case, wouldn't their other protons have different shifts? So the NMR would show other peaks as well, but the question says the rest of the spectrum is consistent. So perhaps the diastereomers are such that the only difference is in the alpha carbon? Or perhaps in this case, the alpha carbon is the stereocenter, so the two diastereomers have different configurations at the alpha carbon.

Wait, but if the alpha carbon is a stereocenter, then each diastereomer would have different shifts for that proton. Because the environment is different. So then the two peaks would have different shifts. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts and equal integrals. So same shift would imply same environment, which would not be the case if it's a stereocenter.

Hmm, maybe the two diastereomers have another stereocenter elsewhere, but the alpha proton is the same because it's in the same environment. Like, for example, if the diastereomers have the same configuration at the alpha carbon but differ elsewhere. Then the alpha proton shift would be same. So for that proton, both diastereomers contribute the same shift, leading to two peaks each integrating 0.5.

But wait, how would diastereomers have same configuration at the alpha carbon but differ elsewhere? Then the rest of the molecule would have different substituents, so other protons would have different shifts.

But the question says that the NMR is 'consistent with the expected molecule, with the exception of two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton.'

So for all other protons, their NMR is as expected. Only the alpha has two peaks.

Wait, maybe the diastereomers are such that all other protons are in the same environment, but the alpha has a different environment. But that would cause the alpha to have different shifts, leading to two separate peaks, but why would the shifts be similar?

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers are actually the same compound in different conformations. But conformations don't usually split peaks because the timescale of NMR is longer than the conformational changes. So that's probably not it.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is with the synthesis, like a failed coupling that leads to a diastereomeric mixture. So the crude product is a 1:1 mixture of two diastereomers.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D says the crude exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. If that's the case, then the LC-MS would show two peaks (since they have different retention times), same mass. And the NMR would show two peaks for the alpha proton if each diastereomer has the same shift for that proton. Or perhaps each contributes a peak, but the shifts are the same.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So maybe the diastereomers have the same chemical shift for that alpha proton. How?

Another possibility: the diastereomers could be epimers, which have the same molecular formula. If the differing stereocenters are not adjacent to the alpha carbon, then the alpha proton's environment wouldn't change, leading to the same chemical shift.

So, for example, if the molecule has two stereocenters, and in the diastereomers, one is changed. If the changed stereocenter is not near the alpha carbon, the alpha proton's environment remains same. So both diastereomers would have same alpha shift, leading to two peaks each contributing 0.5H.

But wait, in that case, the rest of the NMR would have peaks from both diastereomers, but the question says the rest of the NMR is consistent. So that can't be right. Unless all other protons are in the same environment in both diastereomers, which is possible only if the stereocenters are not affecting those protons.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers differ in a stereocenter that is not adjacent to the alpha proton, so the alpha proton's chemical shift remains the same. But other protons might be affected. For example, if the diastereomers have the same coupling in that region, but that's getting too detailed.

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers are actually the same compound but with different stereochemistry elsewhere, but the NMR can't distinguish them for the alpha proton.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other options again.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not entirely sure what that means. Maybe it refers to a situation where two different bonds are formed, leading to two different structures. But I'm not certain how that would lead to two peaks in the NMR. Alternatively, maybe during the amide coupling, some byproduct is formed which is a different diastereomer. But I'm not sure.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Then the mass spec would be different because the precursor has a higher mass. But the question says the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected, so this is unlikely.

Option B: Enantiomers. But as I thought before, enantiomers would have the same NMR, so the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So the NMR should look exactly the same as the pure compound. So unless the sample is a racemic mixture, which would not change the NMR. So this seems inconsistent with the NMR data given in the question.

So that leaves us with options C and D.

Wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So they are not exact. If it's diastereomers, perhaps the shifts are similar but not the same. So the two diastereomers would have their own set of peaks, but for the alpha proton, they are similar enough that the two peaks are close together but distinct.

But then why would the rest of the NMR be consistent? Because in reality, diastereomers have different shifts for other protons as well. So the rest of the spectrum would not be consistent with the expected molecule. But the question says the rest is consistent. So that suggests that only the alpha proton is showing two peaks, and everything else is fine.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers are such that all the other protons are in the same environment, except for the alpha, which has two peaks. But how? That would require that the only difference is at the alpha carbon. But then, the diastereomers must have different configurations at the alpha carbon, leading to different shifts. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. Hmm, maybe the alpha is a stereocenter and the two diastereomers have different configurations there, leading to two peaks.

Wait, but if the alpha is a stereocenter and the diastereomers differ there, then each would have its own shift, but why would they be similar? Maybe the diastereomers are in a situation where the alpha protons are diastereotopic. No, diastereotopic protons have different shifts. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, perhaps the two protons are equivalent. But that doesn't fit the scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment because their configurations elsewhere don't affect it. Like, if the alpha is part of a ring, and the diastereomer changes a substituent on another carbon, but the ring's environment remains same. Then the alpha protons would have the same shift.

But then, the NMR would have two peaks for the alpha proton, each integrating 0.5H. Because each diastereomer contributes a peak. But wait, the question says the two peaks integrate to 1H, so each is contributing 0.5.

So, the LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass, so diastereomers. The NMR shows two peaks for alpha proton, same shift (or similar), so each diastereomer contributes a peak. All other protons are same, so the rest of the NMR is consistent.

So the most likely explanation is D) mixture of diastereoisomers.


The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together integrating to 1H). LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - The spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule except for two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton.
   - The two peaks have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together 1H), suggesting they originate from the same proton environment.
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity are observed, with the same mass spectrum, indicating two compounds with the same molecular weight but potentially different physical properties.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **(A) Contaminated with a precursor**: A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a different mass spectrum. Since the mass spectrum matches the expected molecule, this option is unlikely.
   - **(B) Mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and identical NMR spectra because they are non-superimposable mirror images. This would not explain the two peaks in the NMR spectrum, so this option is inconsistent with the data.
   - **(C) 'Double coupling' during amide-bond formation**: This term is unclear, but it likely refers to a reaction artifact. While such artifacts could theoretically explain the NMR and LC-MS data, the question does not provide evidence for such a reaction-specific issue, making this option less likely.
   - **(D) Mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula but different physical properties. They would elute as separate peaks in LC-MS (same mass, different retention times). In NMR, diastereoisomers can have different chemical shifts for most protons, but if the alpha-proton environment is identical in both diastereomers, they would contribute two peaks with the same chemical shift, explaining the observed NMR data. This option aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The LC-MS data supports this, as diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties, leading to separate peaks. The NMR data is consistent with diastereoisomers that share the same alpha-proton environment, resulting in two peaks with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals.
