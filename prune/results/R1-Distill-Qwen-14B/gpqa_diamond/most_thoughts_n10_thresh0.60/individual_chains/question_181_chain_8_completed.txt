Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is about what happens if the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stops about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. I think the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium by fusing two protons. Then, the pp-II branch involves the fusion of deuterium with a proton to make helium-3. And the pp-III branch... Oh right, I think that's where the helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4 and two protons. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the steps. Or perhaps pp-III is a specific part of the chain where triple-alpha reactions happen? No, no, the triple-alpha is for heavier stars. Oh right, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-III branch involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei to make helium-4 and two protons. So, stopping the pp-III would mean that that particular step isn't happening anymore.

But wait, neutrinos are produced in different parts of the fusion process. The main neutrinos from the Sun are from the proton-proton chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, but most solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain. The pp chain has a branch where during the fusion, a boron-8 isotope is formed, which then decays into two alpha particles, releasing a positron and a neutrino. So the neutrinos from the pp chain are the pep and the main pp neutrinos. Wait, the main pp neutrinos come from the branch where a proton captures a positively charged electron (from the beta-plus decay of boron-8) and emits a neutrino.

But if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean? The pp-III branch is when two He-3 nuclei (from the pp-II step) combine to form He-4. So if that stops, then the He-3 can't combine. But what does that do to the overall fusion process? Well, the pp chain is the main fusion process in the Sun, so stopping a branch might affect the production of certain isotopes and thus the neutrinos.

Neutrinos are produced when boron-8 decays. So boron-8 is formed in the pp chain. Oh wait, the main neutrinos come from the pep reaction and the main pp reaction. The main pp reaction is when two protons collide and one emits a neutrino. The pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction is another branch where a proton captures a positron and emits a neutrino. The neutrinos from these reactions have different energies.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what's the impact? If the pp-III branch is stopped, then perhaps the production of boron-8 is affected. Because boron-8 is formed from two He-3 nuclei fusing. So if that's not happening, then less boron-8 would be produced. 

Wait no. Wait, the pp chain: Let me think about the steps again. The first step is two protons fusing to make deuterium (pp-I). Then, the deuterium fuses with another proton to make helium-3 (pp-II). Now, the helium-3 can either fuse with another helium-3 to make helium-4 (pp-III), or it can capture a proton to make boron-8 (pp-IV or something?), which then decays into two alphas, emitting a neutrino.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. The main neutrino-producing process is the decay of boron-8, which is made when two He-3 nuclei capture a proton each. So, if the pp-III branch is stopped, meaning He-3 isn't combining to make He-4, then more of the He-3 would instead fuse with protons to form boron-8. So actually, maybe the production of boron-8 would increase because the alternative path (pp-III) is blocked.

Wait, no, wait. If the pp-III branch isn't operating, then the He-3 can't combine into He-4. So, the He-3 would accumulate, right? Because normally, in the pp-III branch, the He-3 would combine to make He-4, which is a more stable isotope. If that's not happening, He-3 builds up. Then, the He-3 would more likely undergo other reactions. Oh right, the He-3 can capture a proton to make boron-8. So, the production of boron-8 would increase because the He-3 is not being consumed via the pp-III branch. Because if you can't combine He-3 into He-4, then you have more He-3 available to react with protons to form boron-8.

So, boron-8 production goes up. Since boron-8 decay produces neutrinos, the number of such neutrinos would increase. But what about the other neutrino sources in the Sun?

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, I need to figure out where each band comes from.

The main neutrinos from the Sun are:

1. The main pp neutrinos (pep and others) with energies around 400 keV and up to about 1.4 MeV. Wait, but I think the main pp neutrinos have a spectrum peaking around a few hundred keV, and the boron-8 neutrinos have higher energies. Oh wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

The main neutrinos are from the decay of boron-8, which emits a neutrino when it decays. The boron-8 neutrinos have energies around 1.4 MeV. The other neutrinos are from the pep reaction, which has lower energies (like around 500 keV or so?), and the main pp reaction (like the inverse beta decay) which is higher, but perhaps lower than boron-8.

So, the neutrinos from the main pp chain (like the reaction where a proton captures a positron and emits a neutrino) have energies around a few hundred keV. The boron-8 neutrinos are higher energy, around 1.4 MeV.

Wait, but the question is about bands 700-800 and 800-900 keV. So both of these are in the range of the boron-8 neutrinos? Or perhaps, wait, maybe I'm getting the energies wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from the main pp reactions have a spectrum that includes lower energies, while the boron-8 neutrinos are higher. So the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands would be in the higher end of the main pp neutrinos and the lower end of the boron-8 neutrinos.

Wait, but the energies I'm recalling: the main pp reaction (where two protons collide, one emits a neutrino, to produce a deuterium and a positron) emits a neutrino with an energy around 400 keV, but the maximum energy is up to about 1.4 MeV. The boron-8 neutrinos are monoenergetic? No, wait, no. The decay of boron-8 is via beta-plus decay, emitting a neutrino, but the energy is variable. The maximum energy is about 1.4 MeV, but the average is lower. So the boron-8 neutrinos have a distribution with an average around 0.5 MeV, but some can go up to 1.4 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the solar neutrino spectrum peaks around 0.3 MeV, but that includes all types. Or wait, no, the main pp neutrinos (like the pep and main pp) have a spectrum that includes a peak around 0.3 MeV (from the pep reaction) and a higher energy component (like up to 1 MeV or more) from the main pp reaction. The boron-8 neutrinos are higher, around 0.5-1.4 MeV.

So if the pp-III branch is stopped, the production of boron-8 (and hence those high-energy neutrinos) would increase. But wait, earlier I thought that stopping the pp-III branch would mean that more He-3 is available to convert into boron-8. So more boron-8, more high-energy neutrinos (like in 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands). But the question is, what happens to the flux in band 1 (700-800) compared to band 2 (800-900)?

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy distribution. Let me think again. The boron-8 neutrinos have energies up to about 1.4 MeV, but what's their distribution? I think they have a continuous spectrum with a maximum at around 1.4 MeV. The average energy might be lower, say around 0.7 MeV.

If the production of boron-8 increases, then the flux in the higher energy bands would increase more. For example, if the neutrino energies are higher, then the number in higher bands would be more.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between two specific bands: 700-800 and 800-900. So which of these would be more affected.

If pp-III stops, the production of boron-8 increases. So the number of neutrinos in the higher energy bands (like 800-900) would increase more than the lower ones within the boron-8 range.

Wait, but also, the main pp neutrinos (non-boron-8) would be affected? Let me think. The pp chain is the main process, so stopping a branch would affect the overall production of the other steps. If the pp-III is stopped, the He-3 doesn't combine into He-4, so more He-3 would be available to capture protons, making more B-8. So, more B-8, more high-energy neutrinos.

But the main pp neutrinos (from the main branch) should decrease because if pp-III is not happening, then perhaps the overall fusion rate in that region is affected.

Wait, but the main pp chain is the dominant one. So if pp-III is blocked, maybe the overall fusion rate is slower, but the question is about the ratio of two bands, so perhaps the absolute numbers are less important than the relative change in each band.

Wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were, except the pp-III stops. Oh, wait, no, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. So all other reactions are as before. So, other fusion processes continue. So the production of He-3 via the pp-II branch continues. But the pp-III branch, which consumes He-3, stops. So He-3 builds up.

So, the He-3 can't combine to form He-4, so it's more available to capture a proton and form B-8. So the production of B-8 increases. Therefore, the number of neutrinos from B-8 decay increases.

But what about the main pp neutrinos (the ones from the main pp reaction, not the B-8 ones)? Are they affected? Because if the main pp reaction is part of the chain, but the pp-III is another branch. So the main pp chain continues, but the He-3 can't be used for pp-III, so it's used more for making B-8.

Wait, perhaps the main pp neutrinos are from the reaction where a proton captures a positron and emits a neutrino. That reaction is part of the main pp chain, which is separate from the pp-III branch. So stopping the pp-III branch would not directly affect the main pp neutrinos. Hmm, but in reality, the pp-III and main pp reactions are interconnected because they share He-3 as a product.

Wait, perhaps the main pp chain (pp-I and pp-II) produces He-3, which can either go into pp-III or into B-8 production. So if pp-III stops, more He-3 goes into B-8, which emits more high-energy neutrinos.

So, the flux from B-8 increases, but the main pp neutrinos (with lower energies) might decrease or increase? Hmm, I'm not sure. If He-3 is being used more to form B-8, then perhaps the main pp chain (which produces He-3) may not be as active, but wait, the production of He-3 comes from the pp-II step. So if the pp-III is blocked, but pp-II continues, then more He-3 is produced, but it can't be used in pp-III, so it's used in B-8 production.

So, the main pp chain (pp-I and pp-II) continues. So the main pp neutrinos (from the pep reaction) are produced as usual. But the B-8 neutrinos are produced more.

So, in terms of neutrino flux, the main pp neutrinos (lower energy) are not directly affected, but the B-8 neutrinos (higher energy) are more abundant.

So, the two energy bands in question: band 1 is 700-800 keV, band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, band 1 is lower than band 2.

If the B-8 neutrinos are at higher energies, then the flux in band 2 would increase more than in band 1. Because more B-8 neutrinos are being emitted, which have higher energies, so more of them fall into band 2 than band 1.

But wait, band 1 is 700-800, which is part of the B-8 neutrino spectrum. So the flux in band 1 would also increase, but perhaps band 2 (800-900) would increase even more.

So the ratio flux1/flux2 would be less than 1. Because if band 2 increases more, then the ratio would be less than 1.

Wait, but before the pp-III stopped, what was the situation? The main pp neutrinos (pep) have lower energies, while the B-8 neutrinos are higher. So the flux in band 1 (700-800) would have contributions from both the main pp and B-8. But if B-8 production increases, then the higher energy parts (band 2) would have more B-8 neutrinos.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos have a distribution that peaks around 400 keV, so the 700-800 band would have less, but the B-8 neutrinos contribute more. So, before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 2 was lower because B-8 wasn't as abundant. After stopping, band 2's flux increases more than band 1.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think in steps.

1. Before the pp-III stopped, the production of B-8 neutrinos was at a certain level.

2. After stopping, B-8 production increases, so more high-energy neutrinos are emitted.

3. The main pp neutrinos (lower energy) are not directly affected, as their production depends on the pp-I and pp-II steps, which are ongoing.

So, the flux from the main pp neutrinos in band 1 (700-800 keV) may not change as much, or perhaps even decrease (because if more He-3 is being used in B-8 production, maybe the main pp chain is less active? Or not, since the main pp chain produces He-3 but doesn't directly depend on its consumption beyond that point.)

Wait, the main pp reactions (pp-I and pp-II) produce He-3. If pp-III is blocked, the He-3 isn't consumed as much, so more builds up. But the production of He-3 in pp-II is dependent on the rate of the main pp chain. So, if He-3 isn't being consumed, does that affect the main pp chain? Because the main pp chain is self-sustaining. I think the main pp chain continues regardless, as the production of He-3 doesn't depend on its consumption. So, the production of He-3 via pp-II continues, but it's not being used in pp-III, so more is available for B-8.

So, the main pp neutrinos (like the pep reaction) would continue at the same rate, but the B-8 neutrinos (higher energy) would increase.

So, the flux in band 1 (700-800) comes from both the main pp and B-8 neutrinos. The main pp neutrinos (pep) have lower energies, so perhaps their contribution to band 1 is not as significant. The B-8 neutrinos, which are higher energy, contribute more to bands 2.

Wait, but the main pp neutrinos (pep) have a peak around 500 keV. So maybe the 700-800 band is at the higher end of their spectrum. So, the main pp neutrinos would have a tail into band 1, but the B-8 neutrinos would contribute more to band 1 and band 2.

So, considering that, before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 1 would have contributions from both main pp and B-8 neutrinos. After stopping, the B-8 contribution increases more in band 2 than band 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos have a distribution that is higher in the upper part of their spectrum. For example, the average energy of B-8 neutrinos is around 0.7 MeV, but the maximum is 1.4 MeV. So, the number of B-8 neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be higher than in the 800-900 keV band (0.8-0.9 MeV). Because their distribution is such that more are emitted at lower energies within their spectrum.

Wait, no. The distribution of B-8 neutrinos is a beta distribution, so the number as a function of energy goes as (E)^2 (1-E)^2 or something like that, but I'm not certain. I think the B-8 neutrinos have a higher probability of being emitted with energies closer to their maximum, which is 1.4 MeV. Or wait, actually, in beta decay, the neutrino energy distribution is such that the maximum is at 1.4 MeV, and the average is about 0.6 MeV. So, the number of neutrinos decreases as energy increases beyond the average.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about the neutrino energy spectrum. For the decay of B-8, the neutrino energy can be up to 1.4 MeV, but the average is lower. So, the majority of B-8 neutrinos have energies below 1 MeV. So, the number of neutrinos in the 700-800 keV band (0.7-0.8 MeV) would be higher than in the 800-900 keV band, because the higher end of the spectrum has fewer neutrinos.

But wait, if the B-8 neutrino production increases, then in each band, the flux would increase proportionally to the number of neutrinos in that band.

So, in band 1 (0.7-0.8 MeV), there are more B-8 neutrinos than in band 2 (0.8-0.9 MeV). So, the flux in band 1 increases more than band 2 does. Or wait, no. Because if the production increases, the relative increase in each band depends on the original distribution.

Alternatively, perhaps the production of B-8 neutrinos increases, so their overall flux in all high-energy bands increases. But how does this affect the ratio?

Wait, the question is about the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2. If B-8 production increases, both band 1 and band 2 would receive more neutrinos. But how does this affect the ratio?

Assuming that in the original scenario (before pp-III stopped), the flux in band 1 was F1 and in band 2 was F2. After stopping, F1 becomes F1 + delta1, and F2 becomes F2 + delta2.

But the main pp neutrinos (lower energy) contribute to band 1, while B-8 neutrinos contribute more to band 1 and even more to band 2.

Wait, perhaps the main pp neutrinos contribute a small amount to band 1, but the B-8 neutrinos contribute a larger amount. So if B-8 neutrinos increase, the flux in band 1 and band 2 both increase, but band 2's increase is more because B-8 neutrinos are more likely to be in higher energy bands.

Wait, no. Let me think about the B-8 neutrino spectrum. The number of neutrinos with energy E is proportional to the number of ways the decay can happen with that energy. For B-8 decay, the neutrino energy distribution peaks around 0.6 MeV, with a long tail up to 1.4 MeV. So, the number of neutrinos in 0.7-0.8 MeV (band 1) is less than the number in 0.6-0.7 MeV, but perhaps more than in 0.8-0.9 MeV.

So, if the B-8 production increases by a factor X, then the flux in band 1 would increase by X times the original contribution, and band 2 would increase by X times its original contribution. However, band 1's original contribution is larger than band 2's because of the distribution. So, the increase in band 1 is proportionally similar to that in band 2.

Wait, but if the B-8 production increases, then the absolute number of neutrinos in band 1 and band 2 both increase, but the ratio of the two would depend on the relative contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos contribute more to band 1, and the B-8 neutrinos contribute more to higher bands. But after the pp-III stops, B-8 production increases, which would add more to band 2 than band 1.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck again. Let me think of the ratio before and after.

Before the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 is F1, and in band 2 is F2. After stopping, F1 becomes F1 + delta1, F2 becomes F2 + delta2.

The question is the ratio (F1 + delta1)/(F2 + delta2).

But what are delta1 and delta2 relative to F1 and F2?

Assuming that B-8 neutrinos are a small part of F1 and F2 compared to main pp neutrinos, then the increase in B-8 would cause F1 and F2 to rise, but mainly in the B-8 portion.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos are negligible in band 1, and the B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors. So, if B-8 production increases, then the flux in band 1 and band 2 from B-8 increases.

But in that case, the ratio (F1)/(F2) would be similar to the original ratio because B-8's flux distribution is the same.

Wait, but if the production of B-8 increases, the overall number in each band increases by the same factor, so the ratio remains the same.

But wait, that can't be, because the question is asking about the 'approximate' ratio, which implies a change.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the neutrino production sources.

Solar neutrinos come from two main processes: the main pp chain (pep and others) and the CNO cycle. But the CNO cycle contributes less. The main contributors are the main pp and B-8.

The main pp neutrinos (pep) have a lower energy (around 0.5 MeV, perhaps), while the B-8 neutrinos have higher energies (up to 1.4 MeV, with average around 0.6 MeV). So the B-8 neutrinos would contribute more to the higher energy bands.

So, the 700-800 keV band (0.7-0.8 MeV) is in the higher end of the B-8 neutrino spectrum, while the 800-900 keV band is even higher.

If the pp-III branch stops, B-8 production increases, so the number of B-8 neutrinos increases. So, the flux in both bands would increase, but the higher band (band 2) would have a larger increase relative to band 1.

Wait, but band 1 is 0.7-0.8, which is part of the B-8 spectrum, and band 2 is 0.8-0.9. The B-8 neutrinos have a distribution where higher energies are less common. So, the number of neutrinos in band 1 would be higher than in band 2. So, if B-8 production increases, both F1 and F2 increase, but F1 increases more.

Wait, but if the B-8 production increases by a factor, say, 2 in band 1 and 2 in band 2, then the ratio would stay the same. But perhaps the B-8 neutrinos are more likely to be in band 1 than band 2, so the increase in band 1 is bigger.

Alternatively, maybe the main pp neutrinos have a higher contribution in band 1, and the B-8 in band 2. So, when B-8 increases, band 2's flux increases more than band 1. So the ratio (flux1/flux2) would decrease.

Wait, but the main pp neutrinos (pep) are lower energy, so their contribution to band 1 (0.7-0.8) may be small. So, band 1's flux is primarily from B-8, and band 2's flux is also from B-8.

So, if the pp-III stops, B-8 increases, so both F1 and F2 increase, but since the B-8 spectrum is such that more neutrinos are in lower energy bands, F1 would have a larger increase than F2.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the energy distribution. If a neutrino's maximum energy is 1.4 MeV, then the number of neutrinos with energy between 0.7-0.8 MeV is higher than those between 0.8-0.9 MeV. So, the ratio (number in 0.7-0.8)/(number in 0.8-0.9) is greater than 1. So, if the B-8 production increases, both F1 and F2 increase, but F1 increases more because the neutrino distribution has more in lower bands.

So, the ratio (flux1/flux2) would remain roughly the same if all B-8 increased uniformly. But if the B-8 production increases, the ratio could stay the same, but perhaps the absolute fluxes change.

Wait, but the question isn't about absolute fluxes but their ratio. So maybe the ratio remains the same. But that would imply the answer is C) 1, but the options have other possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos (pep) are the main contributors to band 1, and the B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors to band 2. So, if the pp-III stops, the main pp neutrinos (band 1) are not affected much, but B-8 neutrinos (band 2) increase. So, the ratio would decrease.

Wait, I'm getting really confused here. Let me try to outline the possible scenarios.

Scenario 1: The main pp neutrinos contribute to band 1 (0.7-0.8), and B-8 neutrinos contribute to both band 1 and 2, but more to band 2.

No, wait, B-8 neutrinos are higher energy. So, for band 1 (0.7-0.8), B-8 contributes, as does the main pp (pep) which is lower. So, if B-8 production increases, then band 1 and band 2 both get more B-8 neutrinos. But the main pp neutrinos in band 1 may not change much.

So, the main pp neutrinos in band 1 are a small part, but B-8's contribution is the main part.

So, when B-8 production increases, both band 1 and 2's fluxes increase, but band 2's increase more because B-8's higher energies are in band 2.

Wait, no. B-8's distribution has more in lower energies. So, in band 1 (0.7-0.8), the number of B-8 neutrinos is higher than in band 2 (0.8-0.9).

So, when B-8 production increases, the flux in band 1 increases more than in band 2.

So, the ratio (band 1)/(band 2) would increase.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another approach: the original flux ratio without any changes would be F1/F2. When B-8 production increases, F1 increases more than F2, so the ratio F1/F2 increases.

But what is the original ratio?

If B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors to both bands, then in the original state, F1 is mostly B-8, and F2 is also B-8. So, the ratio would be determined by the shape of the B-8 neutrino spectrum.

So, for example, if in the B-8 spectrum, the number of neutrinos in 0.7-0.8 is four times that in 0.8-0.9, then F1/F2 would be 4. But the options don't have 4. So perhaps the ratio is about 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the B-8 neutrinos are the main contributors to both bands, so the ratio remains approximately the same.

But the question specifies that the pp-III branch stopped, which affects B-8 production. So, the major change is in the B-8 neutrinos. The main pp neutrinos (pep) are less affected, but their contribution to band 1 is probably minimal.

So, assuming that the B-8 neutrinos are the main source for both bands, the ratio would remain the same. But that would imply the ratio is the same as before.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the two bands, so perhaps the ratio doesn't change. Because the B-8 neutrinos increase uniformly across their spectrum, so the ratio of F1/F2 remains the same.

But the options include 1 as an option. So, is the correct answer 1?

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So, the main pp neutrinos may decrease because if the pp-III is blocked, perhaps some steps in the main pp chain are affected. But earlier I thought that the main pp chain (pp-I and pp-II) continue, so the production of main pp neutrinos remains the same.

But if the pp-III stops, maybe the overall fusion rate in the Sun's core is affected. Since the pp chain is the main fusion, if a branch stops, the overall fusion rate might slow down, which would decrease the production of all pp neutrinos, including the main pp and B-8 neutrinos.

Wait, but the question states that all other reactions remain as they were. Oh wait, the first note says: "hypothetically, the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the core of the Sun about 8 and a half minutes ago, while all other reactions remained as they were."

Ah, so all other reactions are unchanged. So, the main pp chain continues as before, which means the main pp neutrinos are produced at the same rate. Only the pp-III branch is stopped, so He-3 isn't consumed as much, leading to more B-8 production. So, the main pp neutrinos (pep) in band 1 are unchanged, while the B-8 neutrinos in band 1 and band 2 increase.

Thus, the flux in band 1 comes from both main pp and B-8. The B-8 contribution to band 1 and band 2 would increase. But the main pp's contribution to band 1 is fixed.

So, before the pp-III stopped, F1 = F_pp1 + F_B8_1, F2 = F_pp2 + F_B8_2.

After stopping, F_pp remains same, but F_B8 increases.

Assuming that main pp neutrinos contribute very little to band 1 and 2 (because their energies are lower), then F_pp1 and F_pp2 are negligible. So, F1 and F2 are dominated by B-8 neutrinos.

If B-8 production increases, then both F1 and F2 increase, but the ratio remains the same as before. Because the B-8 neutrino distribution determines the ratio.

Wait, but if B-8's production increases, the number of B-8 neutrinos in each band increases proportionally to their original distribution. So, the ratio F1/F2 remains the same as before.

So, the ratio would be the same as before the pp-III stopped.

But what was the original ratio?

The B-8 neutrino spectrum has F1 (0.7-0.8 MeV) and F2 (0.8-0.9 MeV). The number of neutrinos in F1 is higher than F2 because the distribution peaks at lower energies. So, the original ratio (F1/F2) is greater than 1.

But the options given are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. So, perhaps the ratio was 1 before, and remains 1.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the B-8 neutrino spectrum. The spectrum is such that the number of neutrinos as a function of energy E is proportional to E^2 (1 - E)^2. So, the peak is around E=0.5 MeV, and it drops off towards higher energies.

So, for E between 0.7 and 0.8 MeV, the number is lower than at 0.5 MeV, and for E between 0.8 and 0.9 MeV, it's even lower.

So, the number of neutrinos in band 1 (0.7-0.8) is less than in band 0.6-0.7, but more than in band 0.8-0.9.

So, the ratio F1/F2 (0.7-0.8 / 0.8-0.9) is greater than 1, perhaps around 2-3.

But since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the main pp neutrinos contribute to band 1 and the B-8 neutrinos contribute to band 2. So, when the pp-III stops, the main pp neutrinos decrease, and the B-8 increase.

Wait, no, earlier I thought the main pp neutrinos are not affected because the pp-I and II are still active.

Wait, perhaps if the pp-III is stopped, the overall fusion rate in the Sun's core would decrease because the main pp chain is a major source of energy. But the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So, the main pp chain, which produces the bulk of the energy, continues. So, the main pp neutrinos are unaffected.

So, band 1's flux is from the main pp neutrinos (unchanged) and B-8 neutrinos (increased). Band 2's flux is from B-8 neutrinos (increased).

Wait, but the main pp neutrinos have lower energies, so their contribution to band 1 is minimal. So, band 1's flux is mostly B-8, which increased, and band 2's is also B-8, which increased.

But if B-8's distribution is such that F1 is higher than F2, then the ratio F1/F2 is greater than 1. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos contribute to band 1, and the B-8 to band 2. So, if the main pp neutrinos decrease, then band 1's flux would decrease, while band 2's flux would increase. So, the ratio would decrease.

But how does stopping pp-III affect main pp neutrinos? If the main pp chain's rate is unchanged (since all other reactions remain), then the main pp neutrinos are the same.

Wait, perhaps the main pp chain's rate is determined by the pp-I and pp-II steps. If the pp-III is blocked, the availability of He-3 doesn't affect the earlier steps, so the main pp chain continues.

So, main pp neutrinos are same, B-8 increases.

So, the flux in band 1 is mainly from main pp, which remains same, and B-8 increases. The flux in band 2 is mainly B-8, which increases.

So, band 1's flux is roughly the same as before (since main pp is same and B-8 in band 1 increases a bit), and band 2's flux increases more.

Wait, but band 1's flux comes from main pp (which is same) and B-8 (which increases). So, band 1's flux increases as well.

But since B-8's contribution to band 1 is small compared to band 2's, perhaps the ratio F1/F2 would be approximately the same as before.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the fact that the majority of solar neutrinos come from the main pp chain, but a significant portion comes from B-8.

If the pp-III branch stops, B-8 production increases, which emits more high-energy neutrinos. So, the flux in higher bands (like band 2) increases more than in lower bands (band 1). So, the ratio F1/F2 would decrease.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos are the same, and the B-8 neutrinos increase. So, band 1's flux increases (due to B-8), and band 2's flux increases even more (since B-8 neutrinos are higher energy). So, the ratio F1/F2 is (unchanged main pp + increased B-8 in 1) / (increased B-8 in 2).

Assuming that main pp's contribution to band 1 is negligible compared to B-8, then F1 ~ B8_1 and F2 ~ B8_2. Since the B-8 distribution is such that B8_1 > B8_2, the ratio F1/F2 is >1.

But since the B-8 production increases, both F1 and F2 increase, but the ratio remains the same as before because the distribution shape is the same.

Thus, the ratio remains unchanged. So, the answer would be 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the problem says the pp-III branch stops. The pp-III branch is the He-3 + He-3 -> He-4 + 2 protons. If this stops, He-3 can't combine, so more He-3 is available to capture a proton to become B-8. So, B-8 production increases, leading to more B-8 neutrinos.

The B-8 neutrino flux in higher energy bands (like band 2) would increase more than in lower bands (band 1), because the B-8 neutrinos have higher energies. So, the flux in band 2 would increase more than band 1.

Wait, but the B-8 neutrinos have a maximum energy of 1.4 MeV. So, the average is lower than that. So, most B-8 neutrinos are in lower energy bands.

So, in band 1 (0.7-0.8), there are more B-8 neutrinos than in band 2 (0.8-0.9). So, when B-8 production increases, both bands increase, but band 1 increases more.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would be higher than 1, perhaps around 10.

But the options have 10 as option A.

Wait, but I thought the B-8 neutrino distribution is such that the number of neutrinos decreases with energy. So, if F1 is 0.7-0.8 and F2 is 0.8-0.9, then F1 has more neutrinos than F2.

So, the ratio F1/F2 would be greater than 1. If the B-8 production increases, the flux in both bands increases by the same factor, so the ratio would remain the same. So, if before the ratio was 10, after the ratio remains 10.

But I don't know the original ratio. The question is about the approximate ratio after stopping.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos are the main source for band 1, and the B-8 for band 2.

Wait, the main pp neutrinos have lower energies, so their contribution to band 1 is small, but they are the main contributors to band 1. But if the main pp neutrinos are unchanged, and B-8 increases, then F1 increases (due to B-8) and F2 increases more.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of it another way.

The pp-III branch produces He-4 and emits two protons. If this stops, the He-3 can't combine, so it's more available to combine with protons to form B-8, increasing B-8 production.

More B-8 means more high-energy neutrinos. So, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would increase more than in band 1 (700-800), because B-8 neutrinos are higher energy. But I'm not sure because the distribution of B-8 neutrinos is such that higher energy is less common.

Wait, but neutrinos with higher energies are rarer. So, in B-8, the number of neutrinos at 0.9 MeV is much less than at 0.7 MeV.

So, F2 (800-900) would have fewer B-8 neutrinos than F1 (700-800). So, when B-8 production increases, F1 increases more than F2.

Thus, the ratio F1/F2 would increase. If the original ratio was 1, it would become higher than 1. But the options don't have a higher than 1 except 10.

Alternatively, perhaps in the original state, the ratio was about 1, but after B-8 production increases, the ratio becomes higher. So, the answer could be A) 10.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: the main contributor to band 1 is the main pp neutrinos, while band 2 is B-8. So, if the main pp neutrinos remain the same and B-8 increases, the flux in band 2 would be higher than band 1.

Wait, but that doesn't fit because band 1 is lower energy than band 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp neutrinos are the main source for band 1, and B-8 for band 2. So, the flux in band 1 stays same, and band 2 increases. So, the ratio decreases.

If before the ratio was 1, now it's less than 1. So, the ratio would be 0.1.

But I'm not confident. Given the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is 1, as the ratio remains the same because the B-8 neutrinos are the dominant source in both bands, and the ratio is determined by their distribution.

But I'm not sure. Looking up, I recall that the B-8 neutrino flux is much higher than the main pp flux in the higher energy ranges. So, the main pp contribution to band 1 is negligible. So, when B-8 increases, both F1 and F2 increase, but the ratio remains the same.

Thus, the ratio would be approximately 1.


The question involves analyzing the impact of the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core on the ratio of neutrino flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The pp-III branch is responsible for the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei to form helium-4, and its stoppage would lead to an accumulation of helium-3, which is then more likely to react with protons to form boron-8 (B-8). The decay of boron-8 produces high-energy neutrinos, which are the primary contributors to the solar neutrino flux in the higher energy ranges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Sources**:
   - The main solar neutrinos come from two processes: the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle. The pp chain includes the pep reaction (low-energy neutrinos) and the B-8 decay (high-energy neutrinos).
   - The B-8 neutrinos have a spectrum peaking around 0.6 MeV, with a maximum energy of 1.4 MeV. The number of neutrinos decreases with increasing energy within this spectrum.

2. **Impact of pp-III Stoppage**:
   - The stoppage of the pp-III branch prevents helium-3 from combining to form helium-4, leading to an increase in boron-8 production. This results in a higher flux of B-8 neutrinos.
   - The main pp neutrinos (pep reaction) are unaffected because the pp-I and pp-II branches continue to operate as usual.

3. **Energy Bands**:
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV, or 0.7-0.8 MeV) is in the higher end of the B-8 neutrino spectrum.
   - Band 2 (800-900 keV, or 0.8-0.9 MeV) is even higher within the B-8 spectrum.
   - The B-8 neutrino distribution decreases with energy, meaning there are more neutrinos in band 1 than in band 2.

4. **Flux Ratio**:
   - The flux in band 1 is dominated by B-8 neutrinos, while the flux in band 2 is also dominated by B-8 neutrinos but at higher energies.
   - Since the B-8 neutrino distribution decreases with energy, the ratio of flux in band 1 to band 2 (F1/F2) is greater than 1. However, the stoppage of the pp-III branch increases the overall B-8 neutrino flux uniformly across its spectrum.
   - The ratio of flux between the two bands remains approximately the same because the relative contributions of B-8 neutrinos to band 1 and band 2 are determined by their energy distribution, which does not change.

### Conclusion:
The ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2 remains approximately 1, as the B-8 neutrino distribution determines the relative fluxes, and the stoppage of the pp-III branch does not alter this distribution.
