Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two reactions. Alright, let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through each part carefully.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The product is A. The second reaction involves 1-nitropropane, KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water, giving product B. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different structures for A and B.

Starting with Reaction 1: 

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure to visualize. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at carbon 1. Then, at carbon 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group (since it's 2,6-dimethyl). Wait, no: the substituents are at 2 and 6. So carbon 2 has an ethyl and a methyl, and carbon 6 has a methyl. Wait, no, the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl, so carbon 2 has an ethyl and a methyl (since 2,6-dimethyl would mean methyl groups at 2 and 6, but wait, the substituent is 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl. Oh wait, maybe the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1. So the ring has substituents at 2,6, and the 2 position has an ethyl and a methyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group (so, substituents at 2: ethyl and methyl), and position 6 has a methyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-ethyl (so an ethyl group at 2) and 2,6-dimethyl (so methyl groups at 2 and 6). So, carbon 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group, and carbon 6 has a methyl. Wait, but that can
