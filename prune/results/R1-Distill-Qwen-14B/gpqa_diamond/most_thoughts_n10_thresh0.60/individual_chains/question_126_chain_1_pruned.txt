Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Each reaction uses different starting materials and reagents. After the reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The task is to determine how many peaks the chemist would observe in each chromatogram.

Let me break down the problem.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. I need to figure out what this reaction does. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but waitâ€”is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one a cyclic ketone or a straight chain? Oh, no, it's a straight chain because hexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone on the third carbon.

So, Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the chain is CH3-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So on carbon 3, there's a ketone, and on carbon 5 (since it's 5-methoxy), the hydroxyl is attached as a methoxy group. Wait, no, the numbering. Wait, hexan-3-one: the ketone is on C3. The substituents are on C5: methoxy. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2 positions. Let me draw it in my head:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6
So, position 3 has the ketone (O), and position 5 has a methoxy group (OCH3). So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be:

The compound is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, maybe I should write it correctly: the formula would be (S configuration) on the stereogenic
