Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of an outside observer. But wait, I'm a bit confused about whose perspective we're talking about here. Oh right, the question is from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, not the time observed from Earth.

Alright, the astronaut is 22 years old when they depart. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is super close to the speed of light. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy, but I'm not exactly sure how far it is from Earth. Wait, the question says Earth is the destination, so maybe I don't need the exact distance. Or do I? Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem is about time experienced by the astronaut. So maybe it's a question of relativistic effects like time dilation, but not considering acceleration or anything, since the speed is constant. So I think I need to use the time dilation formula from special relativity.

The formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured by the Earth observer, and t' is the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

But wait, alternatively, I remember that from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them at speed v, so the distance would be length contracted. So the distance is D = D0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where
