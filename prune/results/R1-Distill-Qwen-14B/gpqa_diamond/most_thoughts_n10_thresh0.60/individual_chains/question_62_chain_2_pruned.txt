Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, I think it's a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, and another carbon has a formyl (CHO) group. Or wait, maybe the hydroxymethyl is connected to the same carbon as the cyclohexyl. Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-(CH(OH)-) group, and another substituent as a carbonyl group. I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond attached to the ring). So, structure-wise, that's cyclohexane with a C≡CH group attached.

I need to find the correct reagents to go from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's look at the options and see what each step does.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagent sequences. So let's think about the transformations needed.

First, considering the target molecule, I notice there's a formyl group (CHO). That often comes from oxidation of an alcohol or perhaps from a ketone, but in this case, maybe from a diol? Or perhaps it's formed via some kind of oxidation. Alternatively, maybe a Grignard reaction or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So perhaps that's a hydroxymethyl substitution on the cyclohexane. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane has the triple bond. Maybe we can do some kind of addition to the triple bond.

Adding to the triple bond—like via a Grignard or organometallic reagent addition. Oh, wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methyl chloride is a methylating agent. But I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → something. Maybe deprotonate to make an alkyne more reactive?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the triple bond can be used to form a ring or undergo some addition. But the target has a cyclohexyl group attached as a substituent, so maybe a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group, which is also attached to another cyclohexane. Hmm, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane can undergo a ring-opening or a cycloaddition? Not sure.

Alternative approach: think about the reagents in the options and what each does.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonating things, maybe to form a benzene ring via elimination, like in a Birch reduction? Or more likely, for deprotonating a terminal alkyne, making it more nucleophilic.

Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. If the alkyne is deprotonated by NaNH2, it would have a strong negative charge, which could attack methyl chloride as an electrophile. So maybe that's an alkylation of the alkyne.

So step 1 would be adding a methyl group to the triple bond.

So ethynylcyclohexane would become CH2-C≡C-CH2 cyclohexane? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. Deprotonating that with NaNH
