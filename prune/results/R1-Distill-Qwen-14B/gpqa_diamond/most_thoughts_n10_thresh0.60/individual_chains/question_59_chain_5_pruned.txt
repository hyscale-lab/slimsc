Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which one's correct.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. So first, maybe I should calculate the moles of each acid and base involved.

Let's break it down. CH3COOH is acetic acid, a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when you mix these, the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react, and any excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll dissociate completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH- ions. Similarly, HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+ ion.

So, step one: calculate the moles of each substance.

Starting with CH3COOH. Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

HCl is next. 400 mL is 0.4 L. 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, it'll completely ionize into 0.08 moles of H+.

Now Ba(OH)2. 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M, so 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH- ions, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when HCl and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they'll neutralize each other. The reaction should be H+ + OH- → H2O. So let's see how much H+ and OH- we have from the HCl and Ba(OH)2.

HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

So the H+ and OH- will react. The H+ is 0.08, OH- is 0.18. So all the H+ will be neutralized, and there'll be some OH- left.

The OH- after reaction: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles. So excess OH- is 0.10 moles in the solution.

Wait,
