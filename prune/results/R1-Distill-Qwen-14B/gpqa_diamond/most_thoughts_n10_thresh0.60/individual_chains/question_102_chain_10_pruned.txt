Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why there's no green signal in the confocal microscope after crossing the mice. Let me break down what's happening here.

First, I need to understand the setup. There's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one construct. The vector has the ligand ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF at the 3', fused to eGFP. So the ligand and receptor are both being expressed from the same construct, but separately.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA stands for chicken beta-actin promoter, I think. Promoters drive gene expression, so this ligand should be expressed wherever the promoter is active. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for a second promoter. So the receptor's expression is dependent on the IRES.

Looking at the stop cassettes, the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette before mCherry, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP. These are stop signals that prevent the downstream genes from being expressed unless the stop cassette is removed. So, the ligand and mCherry are under the CBA promoter, but are separated by a stop that can be removed by Cre.

Wait, so in the construct, the ligand is first, followed by a stop cassette, then the receptor (with IRES), and then another stop cassette before eGFP. So when Cre is expressed, it would recombine the lox sites. If the Cre is from a tissue-specific promoter or a time-specific expression, it would delete the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

The problem states that the mice are homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they're crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. Since the construct is in the mice, I guess the Cre is supposed to be expressed in the neural crest or related cells, like astrocytes maybe?

After the cross, when they look under the confocal, there's no green signal. eGFP is the green fluorescent protein, so the receptor-eGFP isn't being expressed, or not detected.

The options are A to D.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if they're in the same cell, autocrine, that's different. But this doesn't directly explain why eGFP isn't expressed. Also, the question is about expression in the transfection and in the mice. Wait, the initial setup was in primary astrocyte culture, but the question is about the mouse model. So the mouse model's expression is likely the issue.

Option B: receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP is a fusion tag, so if the receptor isn't being transported properly, maybe it's stuck. But this would affect expression, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the construct isn't properly processed, like a frameshift or something. But the question says they used antibodies against overexpressed proteins and tested expression on Western blot. Wait, in the Western blot, using the primary culture, they saw signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins are being expressed. But in the mouse model, perhaps the expression isn't happening because of the Cre not working? Or the construct isn't correctly recombined.

Wait, the vector uses loxP and lox2272. LoxP is a 34 bp recognition site for Cre, and lox2272 is a variant. Cre can only act on loxP sites when they are in a certain orientation. So, perhaps the
