Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to work through it step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I'm supposed to find out what compound A is and what catalyst was used.

Hmm, first, let me visualize the starting material and the product. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring amine. The product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached to the pyrrolidine. Wait, cyclohexylidene means a cyclohexane ring attached via a double bond, right? So the product has a substituted cyclohexene connected to the pyrrolidine.

I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions in amines can lead to various types of reactions, like alkylation, acylation, or maybe some kind of addition. Oh wait, another possibility is that the amine is acting as a nucleophile attacking an electrophilic carbonyl group. Maybe a type of aldehyde or ketone?

Looking at the product, the new part is the cyclohexylidene methyl group. So perhaps the reaction is adding a cyclohexylidene group to the pyrrolidine. How would that happen?

Wait, I think this might be an example of the Stork enamine alkylation
