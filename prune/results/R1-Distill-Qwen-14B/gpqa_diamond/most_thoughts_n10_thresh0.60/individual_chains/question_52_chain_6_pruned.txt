Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves stars with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, why does having spots lower the effective temperature? Oh right, because the spots are cooler regions, so they emit less light. When a significant portion is covered, the star's total luminosity decreases, which lowers the effective temperature as measured from afar.

Now, the main point is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. So, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. They're asking for the factor by which this ratio changes—so when there are no spots, the ratio would be higher than when there are spots. So, the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

I remember from the Boltzmann equation that the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, g's are the statistical weights, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. But wait, in this problem, we're looking at the ratio n1/n2, which would be the inverse. So, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k*T)).

Wait, but the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the near-ultraviolet range. I'm not sure if that's relevant for the calculation, but maybe it's used to find the energy difference ΔE. Let's think: the energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. So, the transition between the two levels corresponds to a photon with λ=1448 Å. So, ΔE = hc/λ.

Hmm, but wait, when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. So the overall temperature of the photosphere (the layer where the light is emitted) is lower when spots are present. But wait, do the spots themselves affect the local temperature, or does the star's average temperature change? I think the question says that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when spots are present. So the effective temperature is the average, which is lower because the spots are cooler.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), each region emits based on its own temperature. But wait, if 40% of the surface is spots, maybe the temperature structure is more complex. But the problem says to assume LTE, so perhaps each part of the photosphere is at its own temperature. Hmm, but the overall observed Teff is 5
