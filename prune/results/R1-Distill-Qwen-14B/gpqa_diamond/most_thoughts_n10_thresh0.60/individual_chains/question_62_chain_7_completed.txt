Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. I'm a bit rusty on my synthesis pathways, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let's understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Breaking that down, it looks like there's a cyclohexane ring attached to a methyl group, which itself is connected to a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexyl group. Also, there's a formyl group (carbaldehyde) on the cyclohexane.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl (triple bond) group attached. So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to figure out the steps to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target. Let's think about the possible reactions and reagents.

The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which suggests some kind of addition or substitution. Also, the presence of an aldehyde group suggests oxidation or perhaps a formylation step.

Looking at the options, each one has a sequence of reagents. Let's consider each step in the options and see which makes sense.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd
3. Ba(OH)2
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Hmm. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination. Methyl chloride would be a methylating agent. So maybe the first step is alkylation, adding a methyl group. Then H2 with Pd is hydrogenation. Ethynylcyclohexane would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so cyclohexylmethane? Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, maybe for elimination. Could that form an alcohol? I'm not sure. The last step is H2SO4 and HgSO4, which sounds like a hydration or acid workup. Not sure how that would get to the aldehyde. Maybe not the right path.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/ H2O
4. NH4OH

NaNH2 and ethyl chloride—maybe ethylation. Then Li and liquid NH3 is a Birch reduction condition, but that's for aromatic rings. Or maybe it's for deprotonation? Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is also used for elimination (like in the formation of alkenes from alcohols via E2). So after ethylation, maybe elimination to make a triple bond again? Then O3 is ozone, which would cleave double bonds. Wait, but the starting material is already triple bond. Oh wait, after step 2, maybe we have a different structure. Hmm, not sure. Then NH4OH as workup. Not sure if this leads to the aldehyde.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. Ba(OH)2

First step: methyl chloride and NaNH2. So perhaps adding a methyl group to the ethynyl position? Making cyclohexylmethyl chloride? Then H2 with Pd—maybe hydrogenate the triple bond. If the triple bond is hydrogenated, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexylmethane, but with a methyl group attached. Then O3 would react with the double bond if present. Wait, but the hydrogenation would have made a single bond. Oh wait, maybe the second step is a partial hydrogenation? Like reducing a triple bond to a double bond. Let me think: NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's deprotonating something or acting as a base in an elimination. Wait, methyl chloride is a methylating agent, so maybe step one is alkylation.

Wait, after ethynylcyclohexane, adding a methyl group via NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be forming a Grignard-like reaction, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where the ethynyl group is replaced by a methyl group. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-Cyclohexyl. Could NaNH2 and methyl chloride perform some kind of alkylation or substitution here?

Alternatively, perhaps that's a Birch reduction condition, but no, Birch is usually for aromatic rings with metals like Na or Li. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about each reagent.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, so maybe it's used here for elimination. If the ethynyl group is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but methyl chloride is CH3Cl. Maybe it's an alkylation. So perhaps the ethynyl group is being converted into a methyl group via substitution. So ethynylcyclohexane (C≡CH attached to cyclohexane) would react with methyl chloride and NaNH2. But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base; maybe it's a deprotonation. Alternatively, perhaps it's introducing a methyl group via a substitution.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the first step is a Grignard-like reaction. NaNH2 could deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form a cyclohexylacetylide. Then, methyl chloride could alkylate that. So, the acetylide (HC≡C- -Cyclohexyl) reacts with CH3Cl. But wait, acetylides are strong bases and would typically attack an alkyl halide. So, CH3Cl would react with the acetylide to form HC≡C-CH2- + Cl^-? Or wait, adding a methyl group to the acetylide. Let me think: when you have an acetylide and you treat it with methyl chloride, it would substitute, giving CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexyl.

So after step 1, we have CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

Then step 2: H2 with Pd over calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation. So the triple bond would become a single bond. So CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexyl would become CH2CH2-Cyclohexyl? Wait, no, hydrogenation of triple bonds (alkynes) with H2 and Pd is typically to convert them to alkanes. So CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane becomes CH2CH2-Cyclohexane? Wait, but that would be CH2CH2? That doesn't make sense structurally. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH3-CH2-Cyclohexane. So the triple bond becomes a single bond, adding two hydrogens. So the molecule would be CH2CH2? No, wait, the structure would be CH2CH2? Or perhaps it's CH2-CH2-Cyclohexane. Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted to a double bond with H2 and Lindlar catalyst, but here it's Pd on CaCO3. Pd is usually for full hydrogenation to single bonds, so the alkyne becomes an alkane. So after step 2, we have CH2CH2-Cyclohexane. Wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2 attached to the cyclohexane, so cyclohexane with a two-carbon chain, both CH2 groups. So it becomes CH2-CH2-Cyclohexane. That's ethylcyclohexane.

Then step 3: Ozone with (CH3)2S. Ozone is for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. But in this case, after hydrogenation, there's no double bond. Unless I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete. Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, we have a double bond. Oh wait, wait! No, H2/Pd is for full hydrogenation. So if the triple bond was converted to a single bond, then ozone wouldn't do anything. So maybe that's not the right approach.

Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider the target structure again. There's a hydroxymethyl group and a formyl group on the same cyclohexane. So maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol. Alternatively, via formylation reactions.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. How? Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would give cyclohexanecarbaldehyde if the triple bond is cleaved. But ethynylcyclohexane is HC≡C-Cyclohexane. Ozonolysis of an alkyne gives two carbonyl groups. Wait, but in this case, it's a terminal alkyne. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would give a ketone and a carboxylic acid, perhaps. Wait, no, for ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne, under certain conditions, you can get a diketone or other products. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the reagents.

Wait, but looking at option C's steps, after step 3, we have O3 and (CH3)2S. (CH3)2S is a reagent used in the workup after ozonolysis. It's a mild reductant and would prevent the formation of peroxides. So ozonolysis followed by (CH3)2S would lead to the cleavage of double bonds into aldehydes or ketones, depending on substitution.

Wait, but in option C, after step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, so there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the correct pathway.

Let me look at option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol
2. Li/liq. NH3
3. O3/(CH3)2S
4. NH4OH

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol is a methylating agent? Or maybe it's for deprotonation. Wait, NaNH2 can deprotonate things. So maybe in step 1, we're forming an acetylide. Ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 would form the acetylide, which is a strong base. Then, maybe reacting with something else. Oh wait, wait, no, the first reagent in option D is NaNH2 and methanol. So perhaps it's an alkylation. Or maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is formed, and then methanol is acting as an electrophile. Hmm. Wait, if the acetylide (HC≡C-Cyclohexane^- Na^+) reacts with methanol (CH3OH), then perhaps it's a substitution. But CH3OH isn't a good electrophile for that. Maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 is used with methanol to form something else. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's think about each step.

Target structure has an aldehyde group. So perhaps one of the steps is a formylation. Formylation can be done via the Gattermann–Koch reaction, which uses HCl, AlCl3, and CO, but that's a different set of reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol. So maybe in the steps, after forming a primary alcohol, it's oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but looking at the target, the aldehyde is on the same cyclohexane as the hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps the aldehyde is part of a larger structure.

Let me think again about the starting material. Ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into something with a CH2CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The target molecule can be thought of as having two parts: a cyclohexane ring with a -CH(OH)CH2- group attached, and a formyl group. Wait, no, the structure is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane has a substituent which is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, and another substituent which is the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the target is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group bearing a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and the same ring also has a formyl group.

So, the substituent is -(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)) and the formyl is on the same ring.

So, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group attached to something else, and then further reactions add the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, that could be an option.

Wait, another thought: If I have ethynylcyclohexane, and I perform a hydroboration reaction, but that's usually for alkenes. Alternatively, maybe I can perform a hydration of the triple bond.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-Cyclohexane) can be converted to cyclohexylacetaldehyde via hydration. How? Using HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water, perhaps. That would add an -OH across the triple bond to form an aldehyde. Wait, but that would require a specific condition.

Wait, the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone or aldehyde. For terminal alkynes, hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water typically gives a ketone. Because the triple bond is between the end carbon (sp-hybridized) and another carbon. So, hydration would give an aldehyde only if the alkyne is not terminal. Wait, no, wait: For a terminal alkyne, hydration adds H2O across the triple bond, giving a ketone, because the sp-hybridized carbon is more electronegative and gets the oxygen.

Wait, so ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-Cyclohexane) is a terminal alkyne. Hydration would yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (because the aldehyde is at the end? Or wait, maybe not. Let me think: Hydration of HC≡C-R would give R-C(OH)=CH2, but actually, it's more accurate to say that it would add across the triple bond to form a carbonyl group. For a terminal alkyne, the hydration would typically give a ketone. Because the addition is such that the more substituted carbon gets the hydroxyl group. Wait, no, in the hydration of alkynes, the mechanism involves the attack of water on the triple bond, adding O-H to the sp-hybridized carbon and H to the adjacent carbon. So, the product would be a ketone if the alkyne is internal, because both carbons are attached to two other carbons. For a terminal alkyne, the product would be an aldehyde. Because the terminal carbon would only have one carbon attached (the cyclohexane ring), so upon hydration, it becomes an aldehyde.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall: when a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) is treated with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration), it adds water across the triple bond, giving an aldehyde. Because the triple bond is between a sp-hybridized carbon (which becomes the aldehyde) and a sp3-hybridized carbon (which becomes a CH2 group). So the product would be cyclohexylacetaldehyde: CH3CH2-C(O)H? No, wait, the triple bond is between the cyclohexane and the CH. So after hydration, it would be O=CH-CH2-Cyclohexane? No, wait, the triple bond is HC≡C-Cyclohexane. So adding water across the triple bond would give HOCH2-C-Cyclohexane. Wait, no, perhaps it's O=CH2-Cyclohexane. Wait, maybe that's not correct. Let me think in terms of actual product.

Hydrolysis of HC≡C-R (R is cyclohexane) with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in water would produce R-CH2-CHO, right? Because the triple bond is between the aldehyde and the R group. So, for ethynylcyclohexane, the product would be cyclohexylacetaldehyde: CH2(Cyclohexyl)CHO.

But looking back at the target molecule, the aldehyde is directly attached to the cyclohexane. So perhaps the target is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with substituents. Hmm.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So on the cyclohexane ring, there's a substituent which is a methyl group attached to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group, and also a formyl group. So the substituents are on the same carbon, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option again.

Option C's steps: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. That could form an alkylation. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond. Then step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis. But after hydrogenation, there's no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So that's a problem. So maybe option C is not correct.

Option D's steps: Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this forms an acetylide. Then step 2: Li and liquid NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination. So maybe the acetylide is treated with Li/NH3, leading to some elimination. Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Ozonolysis. Then step 4: NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the NaNH2 deprotonates the alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, methanol could act as an electrophilic methylating agent. So the acetylide (HC≡C- -Cyclohexane^-) reacts with CH3OH. But I'm not sure how that would substitute. Alternatively, maybe it's a quench with methanol to give an alkene via a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and methanol are for forming a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a substitution where the ethynyl group is replaced by a hydroxymethyl group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about each possible reaction and see which option's steps make sense to reach the target.

The target has a formyl group (aldehyde) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group that can be further functionalized.

Wait, perhaps the first step is alkylation. Using NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-Cyclohexane) treated with NaNH2 (a strong base) and methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would form an alkyne with a methyl group added. But how? Acetylide chemistry. The NaNH2 would deprotonate the ethynylcyclohexane to form the acetylide ion: HC≡C- -Cyclohexane^- Na^+. Then, methyl chloride would react with the acetylide in an alkylation. So the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, giving HC≡C-CH2- -Cyclohexane. So the structure becomes CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

Then, step 2 is H2 with Pd-calcium carbonate. That's hydrogenation. So the triple bond would be hydrogenated to a single bond, making CH3-CH2-Cyclohexane. So now, the molecule is ethylcyclohexane.

Wait, but that's just a single bond. Then, step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis is for cleaving double bonds, but in this case, after hydrogenation, there are no double bonds. So that doesn't make sense. So maybe option C isn't the right path.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation is incomplete. Maybe it's partial hydrogenation to a double bond. But H2 and Pd usually goes to full saturation. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step where a double bond is formed before ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe the first two steps in option C are:

1. Alkyne → alkyne with methyl group via alkylation.

2. Alkyne hydrogenated to alkane, which is then oxidized in some way.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target molecule.

Another option: Let's think about the target's substituents. It has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which is also attached to another cyclohexyl group. So the substituent is a -(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)) group. So perhaps this group is formed via a substitution or addition reaction.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group, which is then functionalized with an OH and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but how would that happen? Maybe via substitution or addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to some kind of alkylation or addition.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the aldehyde in the target is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, perhaps in the steps, after forming a primary alcohol, it's oxidized to an aldehyde.

But looking at the options, which ones include oxidation steps?

Option A: Steps include Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4/HgSO4. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used in elimination or epoxide opening. H2SO4 and HgSO4 are used in hydration or acid workup.

Option D: Steps include O3 followed by NH4OH. Ozone is for breaking double bonds, and NH4OH could be for workup, possibly reductive.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about each step and see which option could lead to the target.

Let me analyze each option's steps.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → perhaps alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond.

3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, possibly elimination.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration.

If step 1 gives a methyl group, then step 2 makes a single bond. Step 3 with Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps for elimination to form a double bond. Then step 4 could be hydration of the double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after step 3, perhaps an epoxide is formed, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option B:
1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → alkylation to add ethyl group.

2. Li/liq. NH3 → possibly elimination to form a triple bond again, or maybe deprotonation.

3. O3, H2O → cleavage of double bond.

4. NH4OH → workup.

But I'm not seeing how this would form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl groups.

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, adding a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so this step does nothing?

4. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps elimination.

So steps 3 and 4 would perhaps not contribute, making this option not correct.

Option D:
1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe deprotonation to form acetylide, then methanol acts as an electrophile.

2. Li, liq. NH3 → strong base, perhaps elimination.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis.

4. NH4OH → workup.

Wait, perhaps step 1 forms the acetylide, which is then treated with Li in NH3. Liquid NH3 with Li is typically used for deprotonation or elimination reactions. Maybe the acetylide is quenched with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps after forming the acetylide (step 1), step 2 (Li/NH3) is used for an elimination, perhaps converting a triple bond into a double bond.

Wait, maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a trans double bond via dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is forming the acetylide, then step 2 is a deprotonation to form an even more reactive species.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible reagents and their typical reactions.

In option D, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozone cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if there's a double bond present, this would break it into two carbonyls. So, perhaps the steps are:

- Ethynylcyclohexane → after step 1 and 2 → forms a diene or a double bond.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexenyl group, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, another angle: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps that's formed via some kind of ring-opening or alkylation.

Wait, maybe the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexylmethyl group, which is then functionalized.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the reagents for formylation.

Wait, formylation can be done via the Stephen reduction, but that's for aryl halides. Another method is the Kornblum reaction (formate ester) but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, the aldehyde could be introduced via oxidation.

Wait, but the aldehyde in the target is attached to the cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the ethynyl group is hydrolyzed to a carbonyl group.

Wait, if the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (HC≡C-Cyclohexane), and we perform a hydration to get cyclohexylacetaldehyde (CH3CH2-C(O)H attached to cyclohexane). Then, perhaps some reactions to add the hydroxymethyl group.

But in the target, the aldehyde is directly on the cyclohexane, not as a side chain. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to some kind of enolate alkylation.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a bromide, then subjected to a nucleophilic substitution or elimination.

But I don't see any bromine or halogenation steps in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, let's think about option D again:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base. If we treat ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, it will deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide. Then, methanol is added. Methanol can act as an electrophile, maybe leading to alkylation. So the acetylide (HC≡C- -Cyclohexane^- ) would attack the CH3 group in CH3OH. But wait, methanol is a poor electrophile for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a quenching step, leading to the formation of a vinyl group. Not sure.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. This is a strong base, used for elimination reactions. Perhaps the product from step 1 is treated with this to eliminate and form a triple bond again? Not sure.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave double bonds, but if step 2 didn't form a double bond, this step wouldn't do anything.

Wait, perhaps in step 2, elimination occurs to form a double bond, which is then cleaved in step 3.

But I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Form the acetylide.

2. Elimination to form a triple bond again.

3. Ozonolysis, but triple bonds don't react with ozone.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about the target. The molecule has a hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane, which is also attached to another cyclohexyl group. So that substituent is -(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)).

How can that be formed? Maybe via a Grignard reaction or a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a CH2 group, which is then subjected to substitution with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is first converted into a CH2 group, then that CH2 group is treated with some reagent to add both the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl substituents.

But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe the target is synthesized via a two-step alkylation. First, add a methyl group to the ethynyl position, then another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to a nucleophilic attack by a cyclohexyl group.

But I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about which options include formylation. Since the target has an aldehyde group, that must come from somewhere. Looking back, option C's steps include O3 and (CH3)2S, which would form carbonyl groups if there's a double bond. So if the steps form a double bond, then ozonolysis would create the aldehyde.

So let's reevaluate option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylation to form CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, forming CH2CH2-Cyclohexane (maybe ethylcyclohexane).

Wait, no, the hydrogenation of CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane would add two H's across the triple bond, making CH2-CH2-Cyclohexane. So the structure becomes CH2CH2-Cyclohexane, which is ethylcyclohexane.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. But ethylcyclohexane doesn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't do anything. So this step is confusing.

Unless I made a mistake in step 2. Maybe step 2 is not full hydrogenation but partial.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is catalytic hydrogenation to form a trans double bond. Wait, but Pd on CaCO3 is usually for full hydrogenation. So that's unlikely.

Hmm.

Let me go back to the target. The hydroxymethyl group suggests that perhaps a Grignard reagent is added to a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via oxidation.

Wait, another approach: The target has a cyclohexyl group attached to the hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps that comes from a coupling reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a cyclohexylmethyl bromide via some substitution, then treated with a Grignard reagent to add the hydroxymethyl group.

But I don't see any substitution steps in the options that would lead to that.

Alternatively, let's think about the possibility of the target being formed via a conjugate addition. But without a double bond, I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the possible products of each step.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Let's say this forms the acetylide.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. Maybe this is for elimination, forming a triple bond again? Not sure.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis, but without a double bond, nothing happens.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonation, not elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for forming a more reactive species.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is forming the acetylide, and step 2 is quenching it with something else.

Wait, perhaps step 1 forms the acetylide (HC≡C-Cyclohexane^- Na^+ ), and step 2 is treating it with Li in NH3. Maybe that's for a different kind of reaction, like a lithium-halogen exchange, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: Maybe the NaNH2 and methanol in step 1 are for forming a methyl ether. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 is a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see a halogen here.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try to think of what each option's steps would produce.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → acetylide.

2. Li, NH3 → elimination, perhaps forming a triple bond again, but that doesn't change much.

3. Ozonolysis → nothing, as no double bonds.

4. NH4OH → workup, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 and 2 form some kind of diene, which is then cleaved by ozonolysis.

Wait, maybe step 1 is acetylide formation, step 2 is quenching to form a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is forming a Grignard reagent, but that doesn't fit with Li and NH3.

Another approach: Perhaps the correct option is A.

Option A:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation, making CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate triple bond to single bond: CH2CH2-Cyclohexane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base, perhaps elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination. So, if we have CH2CH2-Cyclohexane (which is ethylcyclohexane), treating with Ba(OH)2 might lead to elimination, forming a double bond. How? If the ethyl group is in a position where elimination can occur, perhaps with a neighboring H. But ethylcyclohexane is a single bond, so elimination would require some adjacent H. Wait, but ethylcyclohexane is a saturated compound, so elimination would not form a double bond unless there's a substituent that allows for it.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 gives a diol or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 2, we have a cyclohexane with a CH2CH3 group. Then, Ba(OH)2 would eliminate to form a cyclohexene.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is more commonly used in epoxide ring opening or elimination of alcohols. Without an alcohol, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is a Hofmann elimination, but that requires an amide. I'm not sure.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the correct order of reactions.

The target has an aldehyde group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps the process involves:

1. Convert ethynylcyclohexane into a triple bond with a methyl group (alkylation).

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Introduce a double bond via elimination.

4. Ozonolyse the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

5. Perform a reduction or workup to form the aldehyde and hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkylate the ethynyl group to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Oxidize to form a ketone.

4. Perform a Grignard reaction to add a hydroxymethyl group.

But I don't see oxidation steps in the options.

Wait, looking back, the options don't have oxidation steps but do have Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, which are bases and acids.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible reagents and their purpose.

NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation or elimination.

H2/Pd is for hydrogenation.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination or epoxide ring opening.

O3 is for ozonolysis, breaking double bonds.

(CH3)2S is a reductant used in ozonolysis workup.

NH4OH is a mild reducing agent or a source of NH4+.

So, which option's steps would build the necessary substituents?

Option D: Steps 3 and 4 are ozonolysis and then NH4OH.

If before step 3, there's a double bond, then ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Some reaction to form a double bond.

4. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

But I'm not seeing that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the ethynyl group to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain.

3. Perform an elimination reaction to form a double bond.

4. Ozonolyse the double bond to create the aldehyde and other carbonyl groups.

But I don't see such a sequence in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing the pathway.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → acetylide.

Step 2: Li/NH3 → elimination to form a triple bond again.

But that doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 and 2 are for forming a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form the aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the target's aldehyde comes from the oxidation of a primary alcohol, and the hydroxymethyl group comes from a substitution.

So, perhaps the steps involve:

1. Convert ethynyl group into a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

3. Substitute the adjacent carbon to add the hydroxymethyl group.

But I don't see oxidation steps in the options.

Wait, looking for oxidation steps, only option A has H2SO4 and HgSO4, which are used in hydration and possibly oxidations.

Wait, H2SO4 and HgSO4 in H2O are used in the Stephen reduction or the hydration of alkynes. But I'm not certain.

In option A, step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That could be a hydration step to form a carbonyl group. So perhaps after step 3, which is Ba(OH)2, we have an epoxide or an alcohol.

Wait, let's think:

Option A's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylation, perhaps adding a methyl group to the ethynyl position.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2CH2-Cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).

3. Ba(OH)2 → strong base. Maybe elimination to form a double bond. So ethylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexene.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and could induce elimination, but ethylcyclohexane is a single bond. To eliminate, you need adjacent H's. So if the structure is ethylcyclohexane, perhaps elimination isn't possible. Unless there's a substituent that allows for that.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for epoxide formation, but without an epoxide, that doesn't fit.

Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O → hydration. If step 3 formed a double bond, then hydration would form a diol or a carbonyl.

So, putting it together:

After step 3, we have a cyclohexene (if elimination occurred). Then step 4 would hydrate the double bond into a diol or a carbonyl.

But I'm not certain about the specifics.

Wait, if the cyclohexene is formed, then hydration with HgSO4 and H2SO4 in H2O would add an OH across the double bond, forming a diol. But the target has a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene is in a position such that hydration would form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. Hydration would form a cyclohexanol derivative, but not necessarily an aldehyde.

Hmm.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should make an educated guess based on process of elimination.

Looking at the options, option C has O3 and (CH3)2S, which is used for ozonolysis. So for ozonolysis to be effective, there must be a double bond. So, perhaps in option C, the steps are:

1. Alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form a double bond. Wait, but H2/Pd usually hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds, not partial.

Wait, maybe the hydrogenation is catalytic hydrogenation to form a cis-double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylation to CH3-C≡C-Cyclohexane.

2. Partial hydrogenation to form a trans-double bond? No, usually H2 and Pd would go to single bonds.

So, perhaps option C is not the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D.

Wait, another approach: The target has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group attached to the same cyclohexane. So perhaps the aldehyde comes from the ozonolysis of a double bond, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another reaction.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the ethynyl group to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Introduce a double bond via elimination.

4. Ozonolyse the double bond to form the aldehyde and another carbonyl.

5. Reduce the carbonyl to a hydroxymethyl group.

But I don't see a reduction step in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is part of the workup.

Wait, looking at option C:

After step 3 (O3 and (CH3)2S), the product would have carbonyl groups if a double bond was present. Then step 4 is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base.

But I'm not sure how that would form the hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl comes from a substitution.

But I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the target is formed via a formylation reaction, like the Gattermann-Koch, but that would require a catalyst like AlCl3 and CO. Not seeing that in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is formed via the oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if in the steps, a primary alcohol is formed, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I don't see any oxidation steps in the options except perhaps option A's step 4.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the target is synthesized via a conjugate addition. So, the ethynyl group is converted into a carbonyl, which then undergoes a Michael addition.

But I'm not sure.

I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the steps and the target, the correct sequence probably involves alkylation followed by hydrogenation, then ozonolysis, and then workup. So, the correct option is C.


To synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane, the correct sequence of reagents must achieve the following transformations:

1. **Introduce a methyl group** to the ethynyl position.
2. **Hydrogenate the triple bond** to form a single bond.
3. **Form a double bond** to enable ozonolysis.
4. **Ozonolyze the double bond** to generate carbonyl groups.
5. **Functionalize the product** to achieve the hydroxymethyl and aldehyde groups.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Likely alkylates the ethynyl group, forming CH₃-C≡C-Cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming CH₂CH₂-Cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, potentially causing elimination, but ethylcyclohexane lacks the necessary structure for elimination to form a double bond.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Hydration, but without a double bond, this step is ineffective for forming the aldehyde.

This sequence does not lead to the target compound.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the ethynyl group, forming CH₂CH₃-C≡C-Cyclohexane.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely causes elimination, but the product after this step is unclear.
3. **O₃, H₂O**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present at this stage.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup, but the earlier steps do not set up the necessary intermediates.

This sequence does not lead to the target compound.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the ethynyl group, forming CH₃-C≡C-Cyclohexane.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, forming CH₂CH₂-Cyclohexane (ethylcyclohexane).
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, but ethylcyclohexane lacks one, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but its role in this sequence is unclear and does not contribute to forming the target compound.

This sequence does not lead to the target compound.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Forms the acetylide ion (HC≡C-Cyclohexane⁻) by deprotonating ethynylcyclohexane. Methanol may quench the acetylide or form a reactive intermediate.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, potentially causing elimination or forming a reactive species, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not present at this stage.
4. **NH₄OH**: Workup, but the earlier steps do not set up the necessary intermediates.

This sequence does not lead to the target compound.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly lead to the target compound. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the most plausible choice, as it involves steps that align with the transformations required, even though the exact pathway is unclear.
