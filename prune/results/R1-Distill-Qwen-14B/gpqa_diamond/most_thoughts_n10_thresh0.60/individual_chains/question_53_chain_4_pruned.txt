Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the chemical formula of an unknown compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- group or maybe a COO- group attached somewhere. Wait, no, esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R, right? So, the functional group is an ester, which would have peaks around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl stretch. Got it.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals. Let me think about each of them. The first two are aromatic-H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents might be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But wait, the substituents themselves could have symmetry. For example, if both substituents are the same and para, then maybe the aromatic protons would be fewer. But wait, the aromatic signals are two, so maybe it's a para disubstitution. Let me think: para substitution on benzene would have two equivalent sets of aromatic protons. So, for a di-substituted benzene with substituents in para positions, there would be two types of aromatic protons. So that's two signals. That makes sense.

Next, the NMR says two signals correspond to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in alkenes. Wait, but the ester group is also in play. So maybe one of the substituents is an ester attached to a vinyl group, like maybe an acrylate ester? Hmm. Or maybe the substituent has a vinyl group attached elsewhere.

The vinyl protons are split into a doublet and a doublet of quartets. Let me think about that. A doublet of quartets (doublet of quartet) would imply that each proton is coupling with two different sets of neighboring protons. Maybe in a structure where the vinyl group is adjacent to another group with two different neighboring protons? Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system.

Also, the NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. And no signals for -CH2 groups. That suggests that the molecule
