Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand everything.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could look like an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness change as these spots?

Hmm. So, if there were no spots, a planet would block some of the star's light as it transits, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. But in this case, the star's spots are causing a variation, and we need to find what planet size would mimic that variation.

Wait, but how do the spots affect the light curve? Since the spots are cooler, when they're facing us (when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is towards us), the star appears slightly dimmer than when the unspotted side is facing us. So the maximum brightness would be when the unspotted area is towards us, and the minimum when the spotted area is. Wait, no, wait: the star's total brightness is based on the sum of light from all its surface. If spots are cooler, when the spotted side is visible, the total light is less. So the star's brightness would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But the problem says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the total brightness is lower. So the dip in brightness is because of the spots. Without the spots, a planet transiting would cause a dip of the same amplitude. So we need to find Rplanet such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 equals some value derived from the spots' effect.

Wait, but how do spots affect the brightness? Let's think about the star's luminosity. The star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4πR^2 σ Teff^4. If part of the surface is cooler, the total luminosity would be less. But
