Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and their radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillates, which means it radiates. The radiation has a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis.

We're told that the maximum power is A. The question is asking two things: what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what form does f take?

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on λ.

Wait, I remember something about dipole radiation. Oh right! For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator, which is θ=90 degrees, and it's symmetric around the z-axis. The power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) depends on the angle θ.

The formula for the radiation intensity for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, if I'm not mistaken. So the maximum occurs at θ=90, where sinθ is 1. At θ=30 degrees, sinθ is 0.5.

So the fraction would be (sin30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, which is 1/4. So that's the fraction part. So the fraction of A is 1/4, which would mean the answer is either B or C.

Now, the other part is the dependence on λ. The radiated power is related to the amplitude of the dipole and the frequency. Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to the square of the dipole moment and the square of the frequency. But how does that tie into the function f?

Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, so that's the radiation intensity. I think the radiation intensity for a dipole is proportional to (1/λ^4) times (sinθ)^2. Because the intensity for an electric dipole is given by I = ( (μ0 μ_e)^2 ω^4 )/(12π ε0 c^3) ) * sin²θ. Hmm. But wait, ω is 2π times the frequency, so ω is 2πf, and since λ = c/f, ω = 2πc/λ. So substituting ω^4 would give (2π c/λ)^4, which is proportional to 1/λ^4.

So f should be proportional to 1/λ^4 multiplied by sin²θ. So the form of f is λ^(-4), which aligns with option C, which has 1/4 as the fraction and λ^(-4).

Wait, but let me double-check the dependencies. The radiated power is proportional to (d^2 p/dt^2)^2, where p is the dipole moment. For an oscillating dipole, that's p = p_0 cos(ωt). So the second derivative is -p_0 ω² cos(ωt). Squared, it's p_0² ω^4 cos²(ωt). The average power would be (1/2) p_0² ω^4. So the power goes as ω^4, which is (2π f)^4. Since f is c/λ, so ω^4 is (2π c / λ)^4, which is proportional to 1/λ^4. So yes, the intensity (power per solid angle) would go as 1/λ^4.

Putting it all together, the function f is proportional to (1/λ^4) sin²θ. So when θ=30 degrees, sinθ=0.5, so sin²θ=0.25. So the fraction of maximum power (which is at θ=90) is 0.25, so 1/4. The function f is λ^(-4). So the correct option is C: 1/4 and λ^(-4).


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution, which radiates power with a wavelength \(\lambda\). The radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), and the goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\).

For a dipole radiator, the radiation intensity is proportional to \((\sin\theta)^2\). This means the maximum intensity occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), and the intensity decreases as \(\sin^2\theta\) for other angles. At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin\theta = 0.5\), so \(\sin^2\theta = 0.25\). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

The radiation intensity is also proportional to \(1/\lambda^4\). This arises because the power radiated by a dipole is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega = 2\pi f\) is the angular frequency, and \(\omega^4 \propto 1/\lambda^4\) since \(\lambda = c/f\). Therefore, the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(\lambda^{-4} \sin^2\theta\).

Combining these results, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the form of \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\). This corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
