Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and it's located at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Wait, entropy of a black hole—oh right, that's the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The formula for that is S = (Area of event horizon) * (something with Planck's constant and other constants). The formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), but wait, I think that's S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length. Or maybe I should just remember that S is proportional to the area of the event horizon.

So the area A is what I need. The event horizon radius is r = 2GM/c². But from the angular size, I can find the radius. Oh yeah, angular size θ is related to the actual size r through the formula θ ≈ r/d, when θ is in radians. But since θ is given in degrees, I need to convert that to radians first.

So let me outline the steps:

1. Convert θ from degrees to radians.
2. Use θ ≈ r/d to find r, the radius of the event horizon.
3. Once I have r, calculate the area A = 4π r².
4. Use the formula for entropy S, which is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B) or S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Alternatively, I've heard that S is proportional to (k_B c^3 A)/(ħ G), so maybe the exact formula isn't crucial as long as I get the area right and plug in the constants with order of magnitude.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is S = (A)/(4 l_p²) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length, l_p = sqrt(ħ G / c^3). Alternatively, S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G). Oh right, that makes sense because l_p² is ħ
