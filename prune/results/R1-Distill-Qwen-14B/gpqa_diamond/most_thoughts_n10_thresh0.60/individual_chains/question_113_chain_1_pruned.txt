Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons, varying in hydrogen and oxygen counts. Let's look at the clues one by one.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ is probably an O-H stretch. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate hydrogen bonding, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. 1700 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But where does 1650 fit? That's a bit lower, maybe conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, another thing: if there are two carbonyl peaks, maybe it's something like an ester or a ketone with another group. Or maybe it's an acid or an amide? No, the options don't seem to have nitrogen.

Wait, another possibility. 1700 could be an ester or a ketone, and 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like maybe a carbonyl adjacent to a ring (like an aromatic ester or something). Alternatively, 1650 could be an amide I band, but again, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes or aromatic rings. So the compound has some sort of unsaturation—either a double bond or aromatic ring.

Then the mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm a bit shaky on mass spectrometry, but I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment. For example, if the molecule has a methyl group attached to something, like maybe a (CH3) group, but 45 could also be a ketone fragment or something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CO (which is 45: 12+1+12+16=41? Wait, no. Let me calculate: CH3
