Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says that an unknown compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. From each of these techniques, there are certain observations that can help determine the chemical formula. The options given are four different formulas, all with varying numbers of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

I need to figure out which one is correct based on the given data.

Let me start by looking at each technique one by one and see what information they give.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around this region usually indicate the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might suggest something else. Oh, wait, a broad peak around 3000 could also be from N-H stretching, but the options don't have nitrogen, so maybe it's O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine, but the options don't have N, so I'll think O-H for now.

Then there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are important. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak which is usually indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than a typical C=O stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's from a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's an amide or something else. Hmm, another possibility is that 1650 could be a C=C stretch, like in an alkene. Because alkenes (C=C) have absorption around 1600-1700 cm⁻¹. So the peaks could be a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. But if there's a carbonyl, that would suggest something like
