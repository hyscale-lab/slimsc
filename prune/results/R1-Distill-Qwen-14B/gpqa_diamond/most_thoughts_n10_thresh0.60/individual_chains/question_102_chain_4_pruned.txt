Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving ligands, receptors, and some fluorescent markers. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, the setup: A new ligand-receptor pair is found in neural crest cells. They're looking into their developmental roles by creating a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? So the ligand is at the 5' end and the receptor at the 3'. 

The vector details: The ligand ORF (open reading frame) is fused to mCherry. So the ligand is expressed with mCherry as a tag. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So the receptor should have eGFP at its C-terminus.

Wait, but there are stop cassettes. Between ligand and mCherry, it's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, right, these are stop signals that prevent the downstream gene from being expressed unless the stop is removed by Cre-mediated recombination. So the idea is that Cre will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

So the promoter setup: Ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES is an internal ribosome entry site, which allows for the translation of the second gene without a stop in the first. So the vector is probably designed to express both proteins, but under different conditions.

Wait, but when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So for the ligand, the stop cassette is loxP-based. For the receptor, it's lox2272. So if Cre is used, which recognizes loxP sites, but lox2272 is a different variant. Oh, wait, lox2272 is a variant that's recognized by a different Cre variant? Or perhaps it's a site that can be used with a Cre that has a different specificity? Not sure, but I think lox2272 is a variant that's compatible with the same Cre enzyme because it's just a mutated version.

So when Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are excised, allowing the mCherry to be co-expressed with the ligand, and the eGFP with the receptor. So the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is after the ligand. IRES allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for a stop codon in the first. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed as a fusion (if the stop is removed), and the receptor and eGFP as another fusion.

Wait, but the way it's described: the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry. So without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed. Similarly, the receptor
