Okay, so I need to figure out why the scientist's qPCR results have discrepancies. Let me start by recalling what I know about qPCR and calibration curves.

In qPCR, each reaction has a certain efficiency, which is usually close to 100%, meaning each cycle doubles the target. The calibration curve is made by running known concentrations and plotting Ct values against the log of the starting quantity. The idea is that lower starting quantities (like more diluted samples) should have higher Ct values because it takes more cycles to reach the detection threshold.

The efficiency here is 100%, which is ideal. The R² is 1, so the data fits perfectly on a straight line, which is great because it means the calibration is working as expected. The slope given is -3.3. Wait, what's the typical slope for a qPCR curve? Oh right, the slope is usually around -3.3 or -3.4 because of the way the equation is set up. The formula for the slope in the linear regression is based on ln(2) over the efficiency, but since efficiency is 100%, ln(2) is about 0.693. So the slope should be -3.3219... which is close to -3.3. So that makes sense.

Looking at the data, the Ct values increase as the concentration decreases. For example, 100000 copies have Ct around 34, and 10 copies have Ct 20.7. That's a trend we expect because lower concentrations (more diluted) should take more cycles to reach detection, hence higher Ct.

But wait, the question is about discrepancies in the results. Hmm. Let me look at the options.

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, that's not right because qPCR is used for quantification. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Ct values don't align with target nucleic acid. But the R² is 1, so the Ct does align perfectly. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each ten-fold dilution would decrease the starting quantity by 10. In a perfect 100% efficient PCR, each ten-fold should change the Ct by about 3.32 cycles. So a 10x dilution would
