Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. Degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. So here, n=9, m=11, x=2, p=1. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2=6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be three rings, or a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, etc. Probably, since we have a benzene ring (which is three degrees), the rest would be a double bond or an amide or something else.

Looking at the IR data: two bands around 3400 cm-1, which are in the region for N-H stretching or O-H. But the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. So, probably, the compound has a carbonyl.

The 1H NMR data is as follows:
- 1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H: that's probably a methyl group attached to an ethyl group. Like CH2CH3, so triplet because of splitting from adjacent CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H: maybe an OCH2 group, like in an ester. Or maybe an amide NH, but the singlet and broad suggests maybe a –OCH2– group.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H: quartet usually comes from a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3. Wait, but ethyl esters typically have the CH2CH3 as a triplet. But here, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, so maybe it's adjacent to another CH2, like in –O–CH2–CH2– something. Or perhaps an amide or another functional group.
- 7.0 ppm, doublet (2H); 8.0 ppm, doublet (2H): this looks like two sets of aromatic protons. The 7.0 is probably the para position, and 8.0 the other para position. So maybe an aromatic ring with substituents in the para positions. For example, a benzamide where the substituents are on the para positions, or an ethoxy group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, the aromatic protons in the NMR are two doublets. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene. Each doublet is two protons. The lower field (8.0 ppm) is more downfield, so maybe that's an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl, while the 7.0 could be an electron-donating group, like an OCH2CH3.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. But wait, benzamide is a carbonyl attached to the benzene. So the substituents would be ethoxy and the amide group. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be in positions that are ortho and meta to substituents. How would the NMR look? If ethoxy is at 3, then the amide is at 1? Or adjacent? Wait, maybe it's a different arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on the benzene ring in a way that gives the doublets observed. Hmm.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide would be HCON- attached to a benzene. Wait, formamide is HCON–R. So if the benzene has an ethoxy at para position and the formamide group, maybe. Then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let me think about the structure: benzene ring with ethoxy at position 4 (para) and formamide at position 1 (or any position, but since it's formamide, maybe it's attached to the benzene as an N-substituted group). Wait, the formamide would be HCON– attached to a phenyl. So perhaps the substituents are at para positions. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each with two H, as observed.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be a benzene ring with an amine group
