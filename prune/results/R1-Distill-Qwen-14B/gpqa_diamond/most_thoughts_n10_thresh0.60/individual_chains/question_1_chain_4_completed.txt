Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question to tackle. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2, each having different lifetimes. The lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find out the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each with different energy values.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. The energy-time uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh right, so the product of the energy uncertainty and the time interval is inversely related. 

But wait, how does that apply here? The lifetimes of the states are given. I think the energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime of the state. Because a shorter lifetime (like 1e-9 seconds) would mean a larger uncertainty in energy. So, the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(Δt), right?

So, each state has an uncertainty in its energy due to its lifetime. The energy difference between E1 and E2 would need to be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties for them to be clearly resolved. Otherwise, the energy difference might be too small and the states would be hard to distinguish.

So let's calculate the uncertainty for each state. The Planck constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ (h-bar) is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. 

First, for the first state with Δt1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / Δt1 = (1.055e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.055e-25 J. 

Wait, but the answer is in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So converting ΔE1:
1.055e-25 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.59e-7 eV. 

Similarly, for the second state with Δt2 = 1e-8 s:
ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2 = (1.055e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.055e-26 J. 
Convert to eV:
1.055e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.59e-8 eV.

Now, the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the individual uncertainties, I think. So ΔE_total = ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 6.59e-7 + 6.59e-8 = approximately 7.25e-7 eV.

Wait, no, wait. Because the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 is what needs to be larger than the combined uncertainty for them to be resolvable. So for the energy difference to be clearly distinguished, it must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties. So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me compute the sum again. Oh right, 6.59e-7 is about 6.59e-7, and 6.59e-8 is about 0.659e-7. So adding them gives 7.249e-7 eV ≈ 7.25e-7 eV.

So the energy difference needs to be greater than 7.25e-7 eV. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-7 eV. That's way smaller than 7.25e-7. So way too small.

Option B: 1e-11 eV. Even smaller.

Option C: 1e-4 eV. That's much larger than 7.25e-7. Because 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 1e-7, so yes, definitely bigger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, which is smaller than 7.25e-7. So not enough.

So the correct option is C) 1e-4 eV. Because that's the only one larger than the required 7.25e-7 eV.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant (\( \hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \)). The uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) for a state with lifetime \( \Delta t \) is approximately:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
- For the first state with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For the second state with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} = 1.055 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Total uncertainty in energy difference
The total uncertainty in the energy difference between the two states is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 \approx 6.59 \times 10^{-7} + 6.59 \times 10^{-8} \approx 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Determine the required energy difference
For the two energy levels to be clearly distinguishable, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Comparing the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)** — Too small (\( 10^{-9} < 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \)).
- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)** — Too small (\( 10^{-11} < 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \)).
- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)** — Sufficiently large (\( 10^{-4} > 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \)).
- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)** — Too small (\( 10^{-8} < 7.25 \times 10^{-7} \)).

### Final Answer:
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly distinguish the two states.
