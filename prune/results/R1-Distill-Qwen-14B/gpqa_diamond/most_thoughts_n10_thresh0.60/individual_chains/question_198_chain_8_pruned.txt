Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the Co(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, I need to make sense of this.

I remember that the stability constant (formation constant) βn is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex with n ligands. So for Co(SCN)_n^2-n, βn = [Co(SCN)_n^2-n]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n). Right. So the higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2- complex, which is the Co(II) with two SCN- ligands. So we need to find the fraction of Co that's in the form of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, but wait, the problem statement mentions "dithiocyanato" which is two SCN ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2-? I think Co(II) would be in +2 charge, each SCN is -1, so two SCN would add -2. So the complex would be neutral. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure about the charge, but maybe that's a detail for later.

Our main goal is to find the percentage of Co in the [Co(SCN)_2] form. To find this, I think we need to calculate the distribution of the different complexes given the stability constants.

The problem involves using the stability constants to determine the dominant species in solution. The species would be Co^2+ (free ion), [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- (or so), and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, but the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each βn is for n ligands. So:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1=9
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2- → β4=16

Wait, but β4 is lower than β3. Hmm, that's unusual because generally, higher n complexes might have higher βs, but it's possible here because it's a specific case. So the highest β
