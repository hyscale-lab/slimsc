Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. So, in the glass, the speed of light would be 1/n if n is the refractive index. But wait, here the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed of light as observed in the lab?

I think I need to consider the effect of the glass's motion on the speed of the light beam relative to the lab frame. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on relativity here. Let's think about it.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed 1/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. So, do I just add the velocities? Like, using Galilean addition or special relativity addition? Because if the speed of light is involved, Newtonian mechanics might not apply.

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. For velocities u and v, the combined velocity
