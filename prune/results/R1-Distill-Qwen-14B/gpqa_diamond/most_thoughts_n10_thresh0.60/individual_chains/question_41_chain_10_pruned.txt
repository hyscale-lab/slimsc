Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Alright, let me break it down.

So, the setup is: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But wait, that's the speed in the medium when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So, does that affect the speed of light as observed?

I think this might be a case where I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, regular Galilean addition doesn't work; we have to use special relativity.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v. But v is probably much less than the speed of light, right? Because if it's moving at speeds comparable to c, that complicates things a lot. But the problem doesn't specify, so I guess I should assume it's non-relativistic, or perhaps use the relativistic approach regardless because that
