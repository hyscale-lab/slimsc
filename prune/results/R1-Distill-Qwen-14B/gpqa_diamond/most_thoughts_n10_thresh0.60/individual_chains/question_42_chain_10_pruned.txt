Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure about that; maybe it's not super relevant here.

The problem gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. The ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet2. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So Planet2 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet3. Wait, no, wait: the ratio is Planet2 to Planet3. So if T_p2 is higher than T_p3, then the ratio T_p2 / T_p3 is 2.3. So Planet3 is cooler than Planet2.

Also, the masses are given. The mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15. So Planet1 is 1.15 times more massive than Planet2? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the ratio is between Planet1 and Planet2: so I think it's Mass1/Mass2 = 1.15, meaning Mass1 is larger than Mass2 by 15%. Wait, no, wait. If the ratio is 1.15, that would mean that Planet1 is 15% more massive than Planet2. Because 1.15 is 115% of the original. So Mass1 = 1.15 * Mass2.

Similarly, the mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35. So Mass2/Mass3 is 1.35. So Mass2 is 1.35 times Mass3. So Mass3 = Mass2 / 1.35.

The question is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So we need to find the factor by which Planet3's period is larger than Planet1's. So Period3 / Period1 = ?

All planets have the same albedo (0.3), which is similar to Earth's. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature, but since all three are the same, maybe it's a constant factor we can ignore in the ratios, perhaps.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But since all three planets orbit the same star, L and σ are constants. The albedos are all 0.3, so that part is the same. So the equilibrium temperature should depend on (1 - a) and the distance squared. Wait, but (1 - a) is the same for all, so T is proportional to (1/(D²))^(1/4) = D^(-1/2
