Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical scenario where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles; they always come in pairs. I think that's called the magnetic monopole thing. But in this question, they can have isolated poles, so Maxwell's equations must change somehow.

Wait, Maxwell's equations as we know them are four in total. Let me recall them. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Right, so in our universe, Gauss's law for magnetism says that the divergence of B is zero. That implies that magnetic monopoles don't exist because if they did, the divergence would be non-zero (like how electric charge density appears in the divergence of E). So if in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that must mean that ∇·B is not zero anymore.

So which Maxwell equation would change? The second one, Gauss's law for magnetism. So that equation would become ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is the magnetic permeability and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. Or something like that. So the modified equation would allow for divergence of B, which means the equation related to the divergence of B is altered.

Wait, but the question is asking which equations are different. So in our scenario, only the second equation would change. But wait, maybe there's another equation that also changes. Let me think.

Wait, no, in our universe, the other Maxwell equations don't involve magnetic monopoles. Let's see: The first equation is about electric charge, so it's unchanged. The third, Faraday's law, in our universe, has ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect Faraday's law? Hmm, I'm trying to remember. If there were magnetic current densities, then perhaps Faraday's law would have an additional term.

Wait, in the standard formulation, Faraday's law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But if there's a magnetic current, like a flow of magnetic charge, maybe there's a term involving ∂E/∂t or something else. Or perhaps it's added to the Ampère-Maxwell law.

Alternatively, maybe Ampère's law wouldn't change because it's about currents producing B fields, but if there's a magnetic current, perhaps it's another term.

Wait, another approach: if magnetic monopoles exist, then the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields is broken. So the equations would become more symmetric. Let me think about the structure.

In our universe, the electric and magnetic fields are treated somewhat asymmetrically in Maxwell's equations. For example, the divergence of E is proportional to electric charge, while the divergence of B is zero. Similarly, the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B, while the curl of B is related to both
