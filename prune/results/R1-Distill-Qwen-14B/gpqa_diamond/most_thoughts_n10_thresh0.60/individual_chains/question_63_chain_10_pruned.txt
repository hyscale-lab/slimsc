Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're in their fundamental state, which I think is the ground state where both vibrational and rotational energies are at their lowest levels. The molecule absorbs a photon, and we need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule moves to the next lowest energy state.

The given data:
- Mass of X, Mx = 20 amu
- Mass of Y, My = 2 amu
- Bond length, R = 2 angstroms (which is 2e-10 meters, I think)
- Angular frequency of vibration, w = 4e14 rad/s

The options are A to D, with various momenta.

Wait, so the molecule is currently in the fundamental state. That likely means it's in the v=0 vibrational state and the lowest rotational state as well, maybe J=0 or J=1? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, in the rigid rotor model, the ground state for rotation is J=0. But I'm not sure if that's the case here since the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is a bit more complex.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, that model considers the bond length changes during vibration, which affects the rotational energy levels. But I'm not too clear on how that affects the energy transitions. Hmm.

But the question is about absorbing a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So I think that transition would be from the ground state to the next higher energy state. But what is the next state? Is it the next vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1)?

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the energy levels can be a combination of vibrational and rotational states. The ground state is v=0, J=0. The next state would probably be the one with the next lowest energy. But I need to figure out which transition requires the least energy, because the photon's energy has to match the energy difference between the states.

Alternatively, maybe
