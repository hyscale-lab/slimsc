Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. It says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Wait, wait. The options are given, and I need to calculate the correct momentum. Let me think about the concepts involved here. So, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I believe refers to the lowest energy state. Then, when it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next lowest energy state.

I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized. But wait, I'm a bit confused. The rigid rotor model treats the bond as fixed, but the non-rigid rotor allows for some stretching, so it's more like a vibration as well. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor incorporates both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

So, the molecule's energy levels depend on both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational level (v=0) and the lowest rotational level (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, the rigid rotor model has energy levels where J can be 0,1,2,... So the fundamental state is J=0, v=0 perhaps.

But the question mentions the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the next state after the fundamental state should be the
