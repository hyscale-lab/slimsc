Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again and see what clues I can gather.

The question is about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. 

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. The question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. Violent reaction with release of gas W. Gas W's molecule has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So for a molecule, the total neutrons and protons are equal. Let's think about possible gases that fit this.

If W is H2O, then each molecule has (8 neutrons in O + 2*1 in H) = 10 neutrons, and 8 protons (O) + 2 (H) = 10. Oh wait, that's 10 each. So yes, H2O fits because each molecule has 10 protons and 10 neutrons. Alternatively, maybe it's NH3 or something else, but let's see.

Wait, another option is CO2. Let's check: CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O (8 each). So the molecule has 6 + 16 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 16 (each O, 2 O's so 32) = 38. That's not equal. So that doesn't work. What about something like N2? N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons each, so N2 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. So yes, that fits. But wait, N2 is a gas but the reaction is violent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe H2? H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (since each H is 1, but if it's H2, each has 1 H, so 2 protons and 2 neutrons? Wait, H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if it's protium). So H2 would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That doesn't fit. So H2 can't be it.

Wait, maybe CH4. Let's see: C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons. H each has 1. So CH4 would have 6 + 4*1 =10 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 4*0 =6. So protons 10, neutrons 6. Not equal. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe H2O is the gas. Because each H2O molecule has 10 protons (O:8 + 2 H:1 each) and 10 neutrons (O:8, H:0). So 10 each. That fits. So gas W could be water vapor.

So, if so, when X reacts with Y, it releases H2O. But wait, H2O is a liquid under standard conditions, but maybe Y is something that when reacted with X produces H2O. Alternatively, maybe W is another gas.

Wait, another possibility: CO. Carbon monoxide has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (C) plus O:8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each molecule would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Yes, that's equal
