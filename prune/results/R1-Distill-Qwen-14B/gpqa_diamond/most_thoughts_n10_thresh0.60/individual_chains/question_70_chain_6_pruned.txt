Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are different symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember symmetry groups from my studies, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to think carefully.

Let me start by parsing the reactions. There are solid A reacting with gas B. The first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. 

Next, when C reacts with water, it reforms A and produces two acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

Hmm, I should probably figure out what each of these compounds could be. Let's start with the reactions.

First reaction: Solid A + 8 B → C (bright red). So 8 equivalents suggest maybe a ratio of 1:8 in the reaction. What reaction forms a bright red product? Hmm. Maybe it's a metal reacting with something. Oh, wait, if A is a metal, perhaps like copper? Or maybe iron? Wait, bright red makes me think of something like iron(III) oxide maybe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a reaction involving vanadium? I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, when C is reacted with water, it forms A plus two acids. So, C is a compound that when it hydrolyzes, it gives back A and two acids. So, C is likely a salt or some compound that breaks down in water. For example, if C is a nitrate, maybe it breaks down into something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal oxide? For example, if A is a metal, and C is its oxide, which when reacting with water (acidic conditions) gives the metal and some acids. Wait, but that would require the oxide to be basic or amphoteric.

Wait, another thought: if C is a sulfide? No, sulfides usually react with water to produce H2S and maybe some metal hydroxide. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal nitride. Nitrides reacting with water produce NH3 and the corresponding metal hydroxide. But then, the hydroxide could decompose further, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.

Wait, let's think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. And E is extremely hazardous. Hmm, what are dangerous gases? Maybe something like chlorine, but D is a gas. Alternatively, HCl, but that's a gas. Wait, but D is a reactant in another reaction as well. D and B react in 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents can be things like H2O, ethanol, maybe something else, but perhaps H is something like NH3? Or maybe H is an alcohol?

Wait, if D and B form H, a solvent, and they react in 1:1 ratio. Let's think about possible gas B. If B is a diatomic gas, like O2, then D could be H2, and H would be H2O. Hmm, but does that fit? Let's see.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. If A is copper, and B is sulfur (S8?), but that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium, and B is chlorine. Then, 8 equivalents might imply 2 moles of sodium reacting with 1 mole of Cl2? Wait, because sodium has a +1 charge, so for each Cl2 (which provides 2 Cl-), you need 2 Na. So, the reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But that's only 1 equivalent of Cl2 per 2 Na. So to get 8 equivalents, maybe 8 Cl2 per sodium? That doesn't make sense, because sodium is in solid form and Cl2 is a gas.

Alternatively, maybe A is something like iron (Fe), and
