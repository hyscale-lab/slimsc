Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see what the question is. Alright, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D.

Wait, so the setup is a bit tricky. The glass is moving towards the observer, which is in the lab frame. The light beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Interesting.

I remember that when dealing with the speed of light in different frames, things can get a bit complicated because of relativity. Oh wait, but wait, this is a glass medium, not a vacuum. So the speed of light in glass is c/n, right? Because in vacuum it's c, but in a medium with refractive index n, it's c divided by n.

But the issue here is that the glass itself is moving. So we have to consider how the speed of light in the medium appears to an observer in the lab frame. So it's like a case where the medium (glass) is moving. How does that affect the observed speed of light within that medium?

I'm trying to remember the relativistic approach. I think when a medium is moving, the speed of light within that medium, as observed in the lab frame, can be found using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because light's speed isn't just simply additive like classical mechanics; you need to use special relativity here.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)), right? But wait, wait. No, that's when you have velocities in the same direction. So if the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and the light's speed in the medium is u' = c/n (since in the medium, speed is c/n), then what is the observed speed u in the lab frame?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So the light is moving at u' in the medium's frame, which is c/n. Then we need to transform this into the lab frame where the medium is moving at v. So we use the velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²))

But wait, that's when the medium is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So in this case, the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is also moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity. So u' is the velocity of the light in the medium (from the medium's frame), which is c/n. So substituting, we get:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: (c/n * v) / c² = v/(n c). So denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v)/(n c).

So the entire expression becomes:

u = [ (c/n + v) ] * [ (n c) / (n c + v) ) ]

Wait, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator of u: (c/n + v) = (c + n v) / n.

Denominator of u: 1 + (v (c/n)) / c² = 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v) / (n c).

So putting it all together:

u = [ (c + n v)/(n) ) ] / [ (n c + v)/(n c) ) ] 

Which simplifies to:

u = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel out in the numerator and denominator:

u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Factor out the c in numerator and denominator:

= c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

Wait, maybe we can factor this differently. Let me write the denominator as v + n c.

So u = c (c + n v) / (n c + v )

But let me see if any terms can be factored or simplified. Maybe factor out a c from numerator and denominator, but that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out n from the denominator.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about substituting the given values. Since the options are given.

Wait, the problem says take c=1. So c = 1, which simplifies things. So let me plug that in.

So c=1, so u becomes:

u = (1 + n v) * 1 / (n * 1 + v )

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v ), which matches. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the setup. The glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So, the medium is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity. So that would mean that the light is moving faster than the medium in the lab frame, right? So the velocity addition formula should apply as I did.

Wait, but in the velocity addition formula, when adding velocities, the direction is considered. If the medium is moving at v towards the observer, and the light is moving at u' in the medium's frame, then in the lab frame, the light's velocity would be u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ). Since u' is c/n, which is less than c.

Wait, but in our substitution, when c=1, u' = 1/n, and that's correct. So the calculation seems right.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option A: (1 +nv)/(n +v )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is exactly what we have. So the answer is A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic principles. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) toward the observer, and the light beam propagates in the same direction as the glass's motion. The speed of light in the glass, as measured in the glass's rest frame, is \( c/n \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass.

To find the speed of light in the laboratory frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u' = \frac{c}{n} \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame,
- \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory,
- \( c = 1 \) (as given in the problem).

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \) (since \( c = 1 \)) into the formula, we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\frac{1}{n} \cdot v}{1}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n} = \frac{n + v}{n}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

Multiply numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
