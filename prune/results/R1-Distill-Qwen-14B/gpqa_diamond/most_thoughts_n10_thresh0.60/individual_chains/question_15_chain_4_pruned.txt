Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of their transits. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says that researchers want to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they're choosing the one with the higher probability of transiting. Both were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Hmm. Both have the same masses. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars have the same radii. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh wait, but same radii. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is given by the formula (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet, but wait, actually, the formal formula is (R_planet / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) )? No, wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star) / (a_planet) ) * (some function of the star's and planet's properties). Or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but that can't be right because the bigger the distance, the lower the probability. Wait, no, the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because a planet is more likely to transit if it's closer to us (or the star is larger, making the transit more probable).

Wait, I think the formula for the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) )? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, another approach: the transit probability is approximately (R_planet / a_planet) * (R_star / a
