Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. The main part is about two compounds and which one doesn't show tautomerism (which is part A of the problem), and then between two other compounds, which shows optical isomerism (part B). The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different compounds.

First, I need to understand what tautomerism is. Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton and a hydrogen atom are shifted, resulting in the movement of a hydrogen and the shifting of a double bond. It usually occurs in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups or similar functional groups. For example, in compounds like ketones and aldehydes, or in cases where there's an enol and keto form.

The first part of the question asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options for A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinoneâ€”wait, benzoquinone is a derivative of benzene where two oxygen atoms are present as ketones. So it's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. But wait, if it's para, the two ketone groups are opposite each other. Does that allow for tautomerism? Hmm. Tautomerism would require adjacent double bonds or something that can shift. Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on benzene. If the benzene ring is fully conjugated, maybe there's some resonance, but does that lead to tautomerism? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are on adjacent carbons, which could allow for enol formation. Let me think: Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. So the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups, adjacent to each other. So maybe the structure is something like O=C-C6H3-C=O. Wait, no, wait. Benzoquinone is usually 1
