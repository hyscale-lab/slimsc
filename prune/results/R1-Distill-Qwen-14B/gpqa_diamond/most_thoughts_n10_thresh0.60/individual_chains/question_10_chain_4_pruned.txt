Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see what the options are.

The question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with different mass and radius or composition. I remember that density is calculated by mass divided by volume. Volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so density depends on both mass and radius.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth, density should be the same as Earth's, which is around 5.5 g/cm³. I think Earth's density is about that, yeah.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. If this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth, but wait, does mass affect that? Wait, no—density is mass divided by volume. So if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is 5.5, then the volume must be (2 Earth masses)/(5.5 density). Earth's volume is (Earth mass)/(5.5), so this planet's volume would be (2M)/(5.5) = 2*(M/5.5) = 2 times Earth's volume. So the radius must be larger because volume scales with radius cubed. So this planet would have a larger radius than Earth, but same density. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth, so same as option a.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive. Oh, composition matters because same composition implies same density. So if Earth's density is 5.5, this planet should also have 5.5. Because density is same, mass increases, volume increases by the cube of the radius. So for same density, mass is proportional to volume, which is r³. So if mass increases by 5 times, radius increases by cube root of 5. But density is same, so this planet's density is same as Earth's. So same as a and b.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So same density as Earth again, 5.5. Because composition determines density. So the density would be same, but the volume would be smaller because mass is less.

Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. So all the options with Earth's composition (a, c, d) have same density. But wait, option b is a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So same as Earth, same density. So all a, b, c, d have same density? That can't be right. Wait, no. Wait, option a is Earth conditions, same density.

Wait, let me think again. If a planet has the same composition as Earth, then it's density is same as Earth's. So options a, c, d have same density. Option b says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's same as Earth's density, so same as a, c, d.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me reread.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So Earth's density, 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and density ~5.5. So same density as Earth.

Option c:
