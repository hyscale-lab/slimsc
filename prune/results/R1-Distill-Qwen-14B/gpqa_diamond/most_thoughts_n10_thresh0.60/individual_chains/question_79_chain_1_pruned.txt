Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are provided. I need to figure out what the starting compound X was from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Oh wait, I think it's involved in epoxide ring-opening reactions. When epoxides react with amines, especially under certain conditions, they can undergo ring-opening. But wait, wait, in an epoxide ring-opening, the base might abstract a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Or maybe in this case, is it an acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed ring-opening?

Wait, but the solvent is nonpolar, and the reaction is at 403 K, which is pretty high. Maybe it's an elimination or some kind of rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and after reaction, it's something else. Or perhaps the starting material is not an epoxide.

Looking at the product's NMR. Let's look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) → probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded or perhaps an electronegative atom. Or maybe a CH3 attached to an aromatic ring (like toluene), but the shift is a bit up. Wait, toluene's methyl is around 2.3-2.4, so that fits. So maybe two methyl groups?

Wait, there's another at 2.31 (3H, s). So two singlet methyl groups. Hmm, maybe two CH3 groups attached to something. Like two separate methyl groups, maybe as substituents on a ring or something else.

Then, the aromatic region:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H
