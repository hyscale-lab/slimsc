Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A to D, each listing different combinations.

Wait, let me start by recalling what SMEFT is. SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible operators that can be added to the Standard Model Lagrangian, respecting certain symmetries. These operators are organized by their dimension, with the Standard Model being the renormalizable part (dimension 4), and higher-dimension operators added as corrections.

Now, the symmetries. I remember that in any quantum field theory, certain symmetries must be maintained. Let me think about each option.

1. Lorentz symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity. Operators in the SMEFT must respect this because they are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense in different inertial frames. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected. So option 1 is correct.

2. Poincare symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like in spacetime). If a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, does it automatically respect Poincare? Well, Poincare includes translations, which are related to momentum conservation. Since the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's built in a way that respects all the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry because it's a relativistic theory. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So option 2 is correct.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT is an effective theory, but does it include all the symmetries of the Standard Model? I think so. So Poincare symmetry is a subset that's included.

3. CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't respect CP symmetry, though. For example, CP violation is observed in the weak interactions. So, if the underlying theory (like the SM) doesn't have CP symmetry, then the effective theory shouldn't enforce it either. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3 is incorrect.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT stands for Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I recall that in quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. This is a fundamental theorem in QFT. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant (which we already have from point 1), then it must also respect CPT. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if all operators in SMEFT must obey Lorentz, then they must also obey CPT because of the theorem.

So putting it together: the symmetries that all operators must respect are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare is a subset of Lorentz plus translations. So if Lorentz is already respected, does that automatically
