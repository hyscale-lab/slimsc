Alright, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Okay, the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators consistent with the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) but allowing for higher-dimensional terms. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, etc. The idea is that these operators parameterize beyond the SM physics in a systematic way.

So, the operators in SMEFT must respect the same symmetries as the SM. What are the SM symmetries? Well, the SM has gauge symmetries (like SU(2), SU(3), U(1)), and some global symmetries. But the question is about spacetime symmetries, like Lorentz, Poincare, etc.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations, boosts), which is part of the Poincare group. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. So, if a theory has Poincare symmetry, it must also have Lorentz symmetry. But does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry?

I think SMEFT does respect Poincare symmetry because it's an effective theory built from the SM, which itself is a Poincare-invariant theory. So all the operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So options 1 and 2 would be correct in any case.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? The SM respects these, but SMEFT is built such that operators can break these if the new physics does. Wait, no. Wait, the operators in SMEFT are built by adding higher-dimension terms that are consistent with the SM's symmetries. So, for example, in the SM, CP is a symmetry (except for some CKM contributions which are small), but in SMEFT, operators can include terms that violate CP if the new physics does so. So do all operators in SMEFT necessarily respect CP symmetry? Or can they violate it?

Ah, right, the operators in SMEFT don't have to respect all the symmetries of the SM. Because SMEFT is an effective theory that can include new physics beyond the SM, which might violate some symmetries. However, the operators themselves are constructed in a way that respects the SM's gauge symmetries but can include terms that break other symmetries, like CP.

Wait, wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. So, for example, the SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. So when you write SMEFT operators, you have to respect the same symmetries as the SM, right? Because the SMEFT is an extension, but the operators are built by adding terms that are consistent with the SM's symmetry structure. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the SM, so these
