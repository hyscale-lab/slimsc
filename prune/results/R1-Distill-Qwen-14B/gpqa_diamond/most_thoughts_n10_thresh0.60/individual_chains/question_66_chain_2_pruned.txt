Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, and they're supposed to be Lorentz-invariant, right?

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I recall that in the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is built by adding terms that are higher-dimensional but still Lorentz-invariant. So each operator in SMEFT must be a Lorentz scalar. So option 1, Lorentz symmetry, must be respected. That makes sense because otherwise the theory wouldn't be consistent with special relativity.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations? Right, the Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. But in SMEFT, do the operators also respect translation symmetry? Well, the operators in SMEFT are local, so they should be translation-invariant. Because if they weren't, the theory wouldn't make sense as a Lorentz-invariant theory in different frames. So I think Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translation. But does SMEFT require all operators to respect Poincare? Or is it handled automatically?

Wait, maybe Poincare symmetry isn't necessarily imposed separately because the operators are local and thus already translation-invariant. Or perhaps in SMEFT, the expansion is organized such that the operators are part of a Poincare-invariant theory. But I'm a bit fuzzy here. I'll come back to this point.

Third, CP symmetry. CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. I think that the SMEFT allows for operators that might break CP symmetry. For example, certain higher-dimension operators can lead to CP violation. Like in the Standard Model, the CKM matrix allows for CP violation. So SMEFT can include terms that break CP, meaning that operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. So option 3, CP symmetry, is not necessarily a requirement for all operators. So 3 is out.

Fourth, CPT symmetry. CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because of the way the Lorentz group combines with the symmetry transformations, CPT is a symmetry. So if all the operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry, they must automatically respect CPT symmetry. Because the theory is Lorentz-invariant, CPT is a symmetry. So option 4, CPT symmetry, must be respected.

So, which options are correct? The question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So operators must be Lorentz-invariant (1), and CPT-invariant (4). What about Poincare?

Wait, if the operators are part of a Lorentz-invariant theory, then they must also respect Poincare symmetry, right? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translation. But wait, the SMEFT is built in a way that each operator is a local Lorentz scalar. But does
