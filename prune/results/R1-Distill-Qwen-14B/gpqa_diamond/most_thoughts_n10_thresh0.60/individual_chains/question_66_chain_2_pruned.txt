Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where we write down all possible interactions allowed by certain symmetries, up to a certain mass scale. The idea is to include all possible terms without introducing new particles beyond the Standard Model.

Wait, Lorentz symmetry is definitely a big one. All terms in the Lagrangian must respect Lorentz invariance. Because without that, the theory wouldn't make sense—like interactions would depend on the reference frame, which can't be right. So Lorentz symmetry is a must.

What about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes Lorentz, translations (like shifting position and time), and other stuff. So if a theory has Poincaré symmetry, it automatically has Lorentz symmetry. But wait, is the converse true? I think SMEFT includes all terms that are allowed by Lorentz and gauge symmetries. Wait, but does the SMEFT Lagrangian always have Poincaré symmetry? Because Poincaré includes momentum conservation, which is tied to the invariance under translations. But the effective theory is built in a way that respects general principles. Or wait, I'm getting confused. Oh, wait, Poincaré symmetry is more
