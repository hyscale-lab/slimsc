Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Hmm, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula given is N ∝ 1/plx^5. I'm a bit rusty on my concepts, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Wait, let me get that straight. Parallax is the angle subtended by the Earth's orbit as seen from the star. So the closer the star, the larger the parallax. That makes sense. So distance d = 1/plx. Or more accurately, d = 1/(plx in arcseconds) if we're using parsecs, since 1 parsec is the distance where parallax is 1 arcsecond.

Now, the question is how the number of stars changes with distance. So they're asking about the number of stars per unit volume or something like that, I think. Because when you're counting stars in a region, the number depends on how many are in that volume. But the way the number varies with parallax is given, so I need to relate that to distance.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that as N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. But since we're looking for how N changes with distance, I need to express plx in terms of d.

So, plx = 1/d. Because plx is inversely proportional to distance. So substituting that into the equation:

N ∝ (1/(1/d))^5 = (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

Wait, but wait a second. Parallax is 1/d. So 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx raised to the 5th power is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So maybe it's the number density or something else. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell (which is 4π d² dr) multiplied by the number density (stars per volume), but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, maybe the question is more straightforward.

Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And since plx = 1/d, that's N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as d^5. So if you go to a larger distance, you see more stars. But wait, that seems counterintuitive because more distant stars should be fainter and perhaps fewer in number. But maybe this is a specific region where the star density increases with distance. Hmm, but the question isn't about the causes, just the mathematical relationship.

Wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So perhaps the rate of change is being considered. So dN/dr is the derivative of N with respect to r.

Since N is proportional to r^5, dN/dr would be proportional to 5 r^4. But that's the rate of change, not the number itself. Wait, but the options don't include r^4. Let me check the options again.

Options are A) r^3, B) r^5, C) r^4, D) r^2. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars in a region increases with r^5. But wait, does the question specify the number of stars per unit volume, or the number in a shell?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me re-express this.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But plx = 1/d, so plx = 1/d. So 1/plx = d. So substituting:

N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, N is the number of stars. So if N increases with d^5, that means that for each increment in distance, the number of stars increases as the fifth power of distance.

But wait, what's the exact wording of the question? It says, "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?"

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Maybe it's the number of stars per unit distance, not the total number. So, perhaps the number density (stars per parsec, say) is given by N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Hmm, but I think I should think in terms of how N depends on d. Because the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5, so N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. So when distance increases, the number of stars increases rapidly.

Wait, but in reality, the number of stars you observe in a certain direction would generally decrease with distance because stars are more concentrated nearby and farther stars are dimmer and less numerous. But this is a hypothetical scenario where the number varies as 1/plx^5, so the mathematical relationship is what matters.

So the number of stars N ∝ d^5, which is the same as r^5. Looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the relation again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, since plx is 1/d, that becomes N ∝ d^5. So N increases as d^5, which would mean that as you go further away, you count more stars. But in reality, that's not the case, but the question is based on a hypothetical scenario.

Wait, another way to approach: Let's express everything in terms of distance.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx = 1/d, so N = k*(d)^5, where k is a proportionality constant. So N is proportional to d^5, which is option B.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), such that \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \). Substituting this into the given relationship, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{d}\right)^5} = d^5
\]

This shows that the number of stars \( N \) is proportional to \( d^5 \), where \( d \) is the distance. The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance, \( r \)), and the derived relationship \( N \propto r^5 \) indicates that the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) \( r^3 \)**  
**B) \( r^5 \)**  
**C) \( r^4 \)**  
**D) \( r^2 \)**  

The correct answer is \( \mathbf{B} \), as \( N \propto r^5 \).

Answer: B
