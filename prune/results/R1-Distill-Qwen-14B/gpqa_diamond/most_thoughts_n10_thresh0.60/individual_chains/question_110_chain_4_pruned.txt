Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, so the question is about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I remember from my studies that these instruments have different capabilities.

First, I should understand the specs. The ESPRESSO at Paranal can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. Wait, noâ€”wait, the question says stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Wait, but wait, wait. I think that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, a star with V magnitude 17 is actually quite dim. So, if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than (apparent V mag) 17, that means it can see stars with V mag less than or equal to 17, right? Because if a star is brighter (smaller magnitude number), it's easier to observe. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than one with V=17, so it would be detected by ESPRESSO.

Similarly, HIRES at Keck can detect stars brighter than V=16.5? Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." So, which means apparent V magnitudes less than or equal to 16.0? So, stars with V <=16 can be observed by HIRES, and V <=17 by ESPRESSO.

Wait, correction
