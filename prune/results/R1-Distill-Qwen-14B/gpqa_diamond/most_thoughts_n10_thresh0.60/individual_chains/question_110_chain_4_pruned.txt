Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these instruments have different magnitudes they can observe. Let me think.

The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, wait—brighter than 17, so that means the apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So any star with apparent V mag ≤17, ESPRESSO can see.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So apparent V mag ≤16. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16. Because HIRES can't see beyond 16, so even if ESPRESSO can go up to 17, the star has to be within 16 for both.

Now, the question gives me five stars, each with different parameters. I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each and see which ones are ≤16 for both instruments.

Wait, but some stars are given absolute magnitude and distance, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitude using the distance modulus. Oh right, the distance modulus formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs. Also, I need to consider interstellar extinction (dust) because some stars have E(B-V) given. Oh right, the total absorption in V band is given by A_V = 3.1 * E(B-V). So I need to calculate the extinction and adjust the apparent magnitude accordingly.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1:
Parameters: Mv = 15.5, distance =10 pc.
No E(B-V), so no extinction.
Apparent magnitude m = M +5 log (10/10) = 15.5 + 5*(0) =15.5. So m=15.5.
Can ESPRESSO see it? Yes, since 15.5 ≤17. Can HIRES see it? 15.5 ≤16. So yes. So both can detect Star1.

Star2:
Apparent V mag is given as 16.5. So m=16.5.
Wait, but the question says, with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. So stars with m ≤16 can be seen. Star2 is m=16.5, which is beyond 16. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can since 16.5 ≤17. So Star2 is only detectable by ESPRESSO, not both.

Star3:
Given m (apparent) is 15.5, but with some extinction. Wait, no, wait: Star3's apparent V is given, but it has E(B-V)=0.6. So I need to calculate the intrinsic m. Or wait, wait. I'm getting confused.

Wait, the apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. The formula is m_observed = m_true + A_V. Because extinction makes the star appear dimmer (higher magnitude). So if
