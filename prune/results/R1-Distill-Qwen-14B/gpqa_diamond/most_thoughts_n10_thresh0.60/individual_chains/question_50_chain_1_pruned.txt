Okay, so I have this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember some basics.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some scribbled notes next to it. The note is a "size estimate" with a formula: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, Feynman diagrams and loops: each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a certain factor to the amplitude. I remember that the number of loops is related to the order of the process in perturbation theory. Each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant, and also introduces some factors from integrals and such.

Let me think about the general structure of loop integrals. For a loop diagram, the integral is often dimensionally regularized, leading to terms involving 1/(epsilon) where epsilon is related to the number of dimensions. But wait, the given expression has factors like (4pi)^6 in the denominator. Oh, right, loop integrals in four dimensions usually involve factors like 1/(4pi)^L, where L is the number of loops. Because each loop contributes a factor of 1/(4pi) from the integral in four dimensions. So for L loops, you get (1/(4pi))^L.

Looking at the given expression: the denominator is (4pi)^6. So that would imply 6 factors of 1/(4pi), which suggests 6 loops. Hmmm, but wait, sometimes there are other factors. Let me think again.

Wait, but wait. The formula includes other terms. Let's break it down:

The expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

So the denominator is (4pi)^6, which as I thought, suggests 6 loops. But wait, isn't each loop contributing a 4pi from the integral? So for L loops, 1/(4pi)^L. So here, L=6. But that would mean the diagram has 6 loops. Hmm, but that seems high. Maybe I'm missing something.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the typical structure. The general
