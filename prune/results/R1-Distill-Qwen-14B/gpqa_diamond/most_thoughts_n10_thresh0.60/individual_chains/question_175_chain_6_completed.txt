Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they can radiate electromagnetic waves. The question is about the power radiated in different directions and the form of the function f.

The setup is that the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. The oscillation leads to radiation at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis.

The maximum power is A. So the question is asking about two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what form f takes. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a fraction and a power dependence on λ.

I think I need to recall the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna because the spheroidal charge distribution might be approximated as an oscillating dipole. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and minimum along the axis (θ=0 and 180).

The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula: the power is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the intensity (power per unit solid angle) in the far field is maximum at θ=90 degrees. So if the maximum is at θ=90, then the power at θ=30 would be sin(30 degrees) squared.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The intensity pattern for a dipole is (sinθ)^2, which is maximum at θ=90°. The maximum intensity is at the equator. So when θ is 30°, the intensity would be (sin30)^2. Sin30 is 0.5, so squared is 0.25. So the intensity at 30 degrees is 0.25 times the maximum intensity.

Wait, but wait. The question says the maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs where? In the dipole case, the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, so in that case, the maximum value of f would be A. Then, at θ=30, the intensity would be (0.25) A. So the fraction is 0.25, which is 1/4.

So the first part of the answer is 1/4. So looking at the options, options B and C have 1/4 as the fraction. So the fraction is 1/4, so the first part is either B or C.

Now, the second part is the form of f, which is the function of λ and θ. The question says f is a function of λ and θ. What's the dependence?

I remember that the radiated power for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (charge^2 * angular frequency^4) and other factors. But in the far field (radiation zone), the power per unit solid angle goes as (ω^4) / (c^6 r^2), but wait, for the intensity (power per unit area), which is power per unit solid angle multiplied by the area, but for this question, it's about the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity.

Alternatively, for an oscillating dipole, the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to (d²p/dt²)^2 (p is the dipole moment) divided by (c^3 r)^2, but considering solid angle, the intensity in the far field is proportional to 1/(r^2), but since the question is about the function f, which is per unit solid angle, and given that the solid angle element is sinθ dθ dφ, the intensity as a function of θ would have the (sinθ)^2 dependence, which I already considered.

But the question is about the dependence on λ. Wavelength λ is related to the frequency ω via λ = 2π c / ω. So ω is proportional to c / λ. So if I have a term proportional to ω^4, it's proportional to (1/λ)^4, because ω = 2π f, and f = c / λ, so ω = 2π c / λ. So ω^4 is proportional to (1/λ)^4.

So the intensity function f would have a dependence of λ^(-4). Because the intensity is proportional to (ω^4), which is (1/λ^4), multiplied by (sinθ)^2.

So the function f is proportional to (sinθ)^2 * (1/λ^4). So for the form of f, it's λ^(-4).

Looking back at the options: B is λ^(-3), C is λ^(-4). Since we have λ^(-4), the form is λ^(-4), so the second part is λ^(-4), which is option C, which has fraction 1/4 and λ^(-4).

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^(-4), so option C is correct.

Wait, but wait another thought. The problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal, so maybe it's more complex than a simple dipole. But in the far field, the radiation from a dipole is the dominant term. Spheroidal distributions might have different angular dependencies, but for an oscillating charge distribution along the z-axis, the far field radiation would still have a similar pattern, perhaps with a (sinθ)^2 dependence, as in the dipole case.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs at the equator, as with the dipole, so the fraction at 30 degrees is still 1/4.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution shaped as a spheroid, with symmetry along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle in the far field is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f \).

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). This means the intensity is maximum at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) (the equator) and decreases symmetrically toward the poles (\( \theta = 0^\circ \) and \( \theta = 180^\circ \)). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), the intensity is proportional to \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Since the maximum intensity corresponds to \( A \), the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

The function \( f \) depends on the wavelength \( \lambda \). For an oscillating dipole, the intensity is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency. Since \( \omega \propto c / \lambda \), the intensity scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \). Thus, the form of \( f \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \).

Considering the options:
- Option A: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
- Option B: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- Option C: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction and the dependence on \( \lambda \).
- Option D: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), and the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **C**, with the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) being \( 1/4 \) and the form of \( f \) being \( \lambda^{-4} \).
