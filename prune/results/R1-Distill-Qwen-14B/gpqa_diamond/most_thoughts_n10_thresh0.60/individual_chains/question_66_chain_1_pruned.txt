Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Hmm, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? I remember that effective field theories are used when we're dealing with physics beyond the Standard Model, but at energies where certain heavy particles can be integrated out. So SMEFT incorporates all possible interactions that are allowed by the Standard Model symmetries but with higher dimension operators.

The question is asking which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz Symmetry. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, and I think effective theories built from it, like SMEFT, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators must preserve that. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So if the theory is Poincare invariant, it automatically includes Lorentz. But does SMEFT have to respect Poincare? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Effective theories usually are Lorentz invariant, but maybe not necessarily Poincare? Or does SMEFT include all Poincare symmetries because it's a low-energy effective theory valid in a region where these symmetries hold? Hmm. I think SMEFT is constructed as Lorentz invariant, but Poincare includes more: like momentum conservation, which in an effective theory, I think operators don't have to respect Poincare because the effective theory can include terms that are local but may not necessarily be globally Poincare invariant. Wait, wait, no, the effective theory is constructed in a way that's Lorentz invariant, but I'm not sure about Poincare. Alternatively, maybe Poincare symmetry is automatically included because the theory is built in the same spacetime framework. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the key is that Poincare symmetry includes translations. In SMEFT, operators are classified by their Lorentz structure, but I'm not certain about whether they must respect translations. Wait, I think that SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but whether it's Poincare-invariant depends on the context. Since Poincare includes translations (momentum conservation), but in SMEFT we're considering non-relativistic or other effective scenarios, perhaps each operator's validity
