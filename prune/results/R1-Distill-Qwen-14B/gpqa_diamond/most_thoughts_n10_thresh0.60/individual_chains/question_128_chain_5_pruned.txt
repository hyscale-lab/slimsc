Okay, so I just landed this awesome job at Stanford, and the first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The Principal Investigator gave me the amino acid sequence, and I need to choose the right plasmid from four options. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

First off, I remember that E. coli is commonly used for protein expression, especially when the protein is from another organism like humans. But wait, E. coli doesn't have the machinery to add certain modifications that human proteins might need. Oh right, like mammalian cells add things like a lot of disulfide bonds and maybe some glycosylation, but E. coli can't do that. So for P53, which is a human protein, maybe it's expressed without some post-translational modifications. I wonder if that affects the plasmid choice.

The plasmids are options A, B, C, D. They all look like DNA sequences, probably the coding regions for the protein. I'm thinking about what parts are important in a plasmid for correct expression in E. coli. Oh right, the plasmid should have a promoter that E. coli can recognize, like the T7 promoter since BL21 strains often use T7 RNA polymerase.

Looking at the options, the beginning of each sequence seems to start with ATG, which is the start codon. So each probably includes the coding region. But wait, there's more to it. The plasmid should have a promoter before the ATG. Let me check the very beginning of each option.

Option A starts with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATG... Wait, the first part before the ATG is some Gs and Cs. Oh wait, that's the vector's sequence. The actual gene probably starts with ATG followed by the coding sequence. Maybe the presence of a promoter is in the vector part. Hmm, but how can I tell which one is correct.

Wait, another thing: E. coli's BL21 strains are typically used with a T7 promoter because they have the T7 RNA polymerase. So the plasmid should have a T7 promoter upstream of the gene. Looking at the options, I need to see if the sequence starts with something that includes a T7 promoter.

Looking at the options, the very beginning of each is the same except for a few parts. Let me compare them:

Option A: The first part after ATG is GAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGA...

Option B: Similarly starts with GAGGAGCCGCA... but I think the exact sequence might vary.

Wait, but maybe the plasmids are for different systems. Like, some might be for mammalian expression, others for bacterial. Since we're using E. coli, the plasmid must have a bacterial origin of replication and a bacterial promoter.

Looking deeper into the sequences, perhaps the presence of a R
