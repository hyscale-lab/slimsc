Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio of this number (N1/N2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the ratio of atoms in two energy levels in a star's photosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels based on their temperatures. The formula is something like N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio is N1/N2. So the formula would be N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Because if you take N2/N1 as the ratio, then flipping it would give N1/N2 = 1/(N2/N1).

So, the ratio N1/N2 depends on the temperature. When the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So, the temperature in the photosphere when there are spots is lower than when there are none.

Wait, but the star isn't uniformly at 5500 K. The spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the surface is at 6000 K. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is spotted. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Because effective temperature is an average, so maybe the star's overall emission is as if it's at 5500 K. But the photosphere itself is a mix of hotter and cooler regions.

But the question says that in the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of Ti atoms, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So perhaps the effective temperature in the photosphere is lower on average, leading to a lower ratio.

Wait, the ratio N1/N2 is (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k*T) ). So if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k*T) becomes larger, because T is smaller. So exp(positive number) would increase. So N1/N2 would increase as T decreases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait wait, no. Let me get the formula correct.
