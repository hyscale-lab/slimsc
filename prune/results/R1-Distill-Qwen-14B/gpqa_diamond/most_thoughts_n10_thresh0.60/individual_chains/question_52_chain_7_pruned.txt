Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Then, when they look at the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2), they notice this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and we can assume Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So first, I need to think about the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in LTE, the ratio is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The question gives us a transition wavelength. Since the wavelength is about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe even extreme UV. So the energy difference between the levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. Let me calculate ΔE for this transition.

But wait, actually, I don't need the exact value because the ratio involves the exponential of (ΔE/(kT)), so maybe taking the ratio of the ratios at two different temperatures would be better.

So the problem is about how the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels changes when the effective temperature of the star changes. The ratio without spots is higher than when spots are present, so when the star cools (spots present), the ratio decreases. So the factor would be (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = ?

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights of the levels. But the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 (n1/n2), or the other way around? Wait, the problem says the ratio of the number in level 1 to level 2 (level 1 and level 2). Oh, wait, the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when the star is cooler, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower, which implies that the ratio n2/n1 is higher. Wait no, no, wait: the ratio they're looking at is n1/n2. Because when the star is cooler, that ratio goes down. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio in question is n2/n1. Let me think again. The Boltzmann distribution
