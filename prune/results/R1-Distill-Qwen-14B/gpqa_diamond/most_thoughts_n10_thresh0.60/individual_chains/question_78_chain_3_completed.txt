Okay, so I have this physics problem about electromagnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it produces both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials, respectively.

The question is asking for the expressions of the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a given time t and position r. The setup is that the charge q is moving along some trajectory s(t), and the fields are observed at point r. There's a vector d which is from the point where the field was generated at time tr (earlier time) to the observation point r. So, at time tr, the charge was at some position, and that's when the field was generated. Now, at time t, which is later than tr, we're looking at the potentials.

I think I should recall how potentials are derived for a moving charge. The scalar potential V is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A with the magnetic field. For a static charge, V is straightforward—like Coulomb's law, which is q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get a bit more complicated because of the motion affecting the potentials.

Wait, when the charge moves, there's a consideration of retarded time. So the potentials aren't just based on the current position but the position at a previous time. So the distance involved isn't just r but some other term involving the vector d and the velocity v.

I remember something about the Lorentz transformation affecting the potentials when charges are in motion. Oh right, in special relativity, the electric and magnetic fields transform into each other when changing frames. So the potentials must account for that.

Let me think about the general expressions for potentials. The scalar potential V for a moving charge is given by something like q/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. But wait, the denominator should be the distance in the context of the charge's velocity. So the term inside the denominator is c times the vector d minus the dot product of v and d. Or is it plus or minus? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Similarly, the vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge. I think A is proportional to v multiplied by some factor involving μ₀ and the scalar potential. Oh, right, A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times something over the same denominator as V.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: V is q/(4πε₀ r), and A is v²/c² times V. Wait, that doesn't seem right because the denominator in V here is just r, not involving the vector d or any velocity terms. Also, A being proportional to v squared seems odd. I don't recall A depending on v squared in this scenario. So probably not option A.

Option B: V is the same as option A, and A is v/c² times V. Hmm, again, the V is static Coulomb potential, which ignores the motion's effect on the potential. So this can't be right either, because when the charge moves, the potentials should depend on the vector d and the velocity at the time tr.

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Wait, the denominator here is (d c - v·d). That term is like c times the vector d minus the dot product of v and d. Wait, no, because when you have d and v as vectors, the term should be something like c*d - v*(something). Oh wait, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - v·d), but in the option, it's written as (d c - v·d). Wait, no, the way it's written in option C is (dc - d·v), but d is a vector, so that's a bit confusing. Wait, no, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Let me see: The term in the denominator for option C is (d c - d·v). Wait, no, d is a vector multiplied by c, and then subtracting the dot product of d and v. That can't be right dimensionally because d is a vector, c is scalar, so d*c is a vector, but d·v is a scalar, so vector minus scalar? That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe I'm reading it wrong. Wait, the denominator is (d c - d·v), but that would mix vector and scalar, which isn't correct. Oh wait, perhaps the term is (c*d - (v × something)) or maybe it's (c * |d| - v·d). Oh, perhaps the denominator should be (c * |d| - v·d), but in option C it's written as (d c - d·v), which is a vector minus a scalar. That can't be right. So perhaps option C's expression is incorrect in the denominator, because they're combining vectors and scalars.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering the correct form. Let me think again. The correct expression for the scalar potential due to a moving charge is something like q/(4πε₀ (c (t - t_r) - (r - r'))·(r - r')/(c))), where t_r is the retarded time. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (r - r')c - (v)(t - t_r). But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, the expression I remember is V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) / [c (t - t_r) - (r - r') · v(t_r)/c ] or something along those lines. Wait, no, that's getting into the time component, which might not be necessary here.

Wait, another approach: the scalar potential for a charge in motion can be written as V(r) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(c τ - d·v)), where τ is the time component. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the potentials in terms of the expressions.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:

V(r) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/(c (t - t_r) - (r - r(t_r)) · v_r /c )

Wait, but in the problem, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So r - r(t_r) would be d. So the denominator becomes c(t - t_r) - (d · v)/c. Oh, but if t is the observation time and tr is the retarded time, then t - tr is the time it takes for the field to propagate from the charge's position at tr to r. So the denominator is c*(t - tr) - (d · v)/c. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (c * (t - tr) ) - (d · (v / c )) ). So the denominator would be (c^2 (t - tr) - d · v)/c. So that would make the denominator c (t - tr) - (d · v)/c.

Wait, that might imply that it's [c (t - tr) - (d · v)/c ]^{-1}.

But perhaps in the options, the denominator is written as (d c - d·v). Wait, that would be (c * d) - (d · v). But d is a vector, and (d · v) is a scalar, so combining them as a vector minus a scalar isn't correct. So perhaps the correct denominator is (c |d| - d · v), which would be a scalar. Hmm, that would make sense dimensionally.

Wait, looking again at option C: the denominator is (d c - d · v). Oh, but that's a vector (d multiplied by c) minus a scalar (d · v). That can't be right. So perhaps option C is written incorrectly, which would mean it's not the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The scalar potential is given by V = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/(c τ - d·v), where τ is the time interval. But that would result in a scalar denominator. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the correct expressions for the potentials are derived from the Liénard's equations or the retarded potentials. The scalar potential V is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1 / ( c (t - t_r) - (r - r(t_r)) · v(t_r) ) ]

But t_r is the retarded time, which is when the charge was at position r(t_r), and the field propagates to r at time t.

So, (r - r(t_r)) is the vector d, and v(t_r) is the velocity vector at time t_r. So the denominator becomes c (t - t_r) - (d · v).

But let's compute the denominator. Let's say t_r = t - |d|/c. Because the time it takes for the field to reach from the charge's position at t_r to r is |d|/c. So t - t_r = |d|/c.

So substituting that, denominator:

c (t - t_r) → c (|d|/c) ) → |d|.

So denominator becomes |d| - (d · v)/c.

Wait, because d is (r - r(t_r)), which is a vector. So (d · v) is a scalar, and |d| is the magnitude. So the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c.

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v). Wait, that would be (c * d) - (d · v). Hmm, which is a vector, which wouldn't make sense. So perhaps that's a mistake. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is |d| c - d · v, which would be a scalar.

Wait, let me think again. The term in the denominator is c(t - t_r) - (d · v). But since t - t_r is |d| / c, then the denominator becomes |d| - (d · v)/c.

So, the expression for V would be (q/(4πε₀)) / ( |d| - (d · v)/(c) ) multiplied by 1/c? Wait, no, because the denominator is |d| - (d·v)/c, but wait, the denominator in the expression I have is [c(t - t_r) - (d · v)].

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the vector potential. The vector potential A should be (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times the same denominator as V. Because A is proportional to v multiplied by the scalar potential's terms.

Looking at option C, A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)). Wait, that's (μ₀ q c v) divided by 4π times (d c - d · v). Wait, but I thought A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) times (something). So option C's A has an extra c here. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct expressions are:

V = (q c)/(4πε₀ ( c |d| - d·v )) * (1/c) ?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the correct formula. Let me recall. The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (1/(4πε₀)) * ∫ [ρ(r', t') ] / |r - r'| dt'

But since the charge is moving, and we're using retarded potentials, ρ is zero except at r' = r(t_r), the charge's position at the retarded time t_r. So,

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/| r - r(t_r) - ( (r - r(t_r)) · v(t_r) )/(c^2) ) | 

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe another approach: the potentials for a moving charge can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( [c (t - t_r)] - (d · v(t_r)) )

Hmm, since d is r - r(t_r), which is the displacement vector. So the denominator would be c (t - t_r) - (d · v).

But again, t - t_r is |d|/c. So substituting,

Denominator = c (|d|/c) - (d · v) = |d| - (d · v)/c.

Wait, that's a scalar. So the denominator is |d| - (d · v)/c. So the expression for V would be (q/(4πε₀)) / ( |d| - (d · v)/c ) * (1/c?), I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is V = (q c)/(4πε₀ (c |d| - d · v)).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the denominator is c |d| - d · v, then the units would work out. Let me check the units. ε₀ has units of C²/(N·m²), q is Coulombs, d is meters. So numerator is C * (m/s) [since c is m/s] → C m/s.

Denominator: (c |d|) is m²/s, and (d · v) is (m)(m/s) → m²/s. So denominator is (m²/s) [c|d|] minus (m²/s) [d·v], which is (m²/s) times (something). So the overall denominator is m²/s, and numerator is C m/s. So V would have units C m/s / (m²/s) ) → C/(m), which is correct for electric potential (Volts).

So V = (q c) / [4πε₀ (c |d| - d · v) ]

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v), which is (c d) - (d · v). But d is a vector, so that would imply a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Looking at option D: V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c + d · v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c + d·v)).

Wait, but if the denominator is (c d + d · v), that's again vector plus scalar, which is wrong. So that can't be right either.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the general form of the potentials. The scalar potential V for a moving charge should depend on the charge's position and velocity. The expression should be such that when the charge is stationary, V reduces to the Coulomb potential. Similarly, the vector potential A would be zero in that case.

Wait, when the charge is stationary, v=0. So, in the denominator, any terms involving v would drop out. So for V, if the denominator is (c |d| - 0), then V becomes (q c)/(4π ε₀ (c |d| )) → (q )/(4π ε₀ |d| ), which is Coulomb's law. So that works.

Similarly, for A, when v=0, A would be zero, which is correct because a stationary charge doesn't produce a magnetic field.

So looking back at the options, option C has the denominator (d c - d·v). But wait, when v=0, that becomes (d c), which is a vector. So V would be (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c)), which would be (q c)/(4π ε₀ c |d| ), which is (q)/(4π ε₀ |d| ), correct. So that works for V. But wait, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v), which is a vector minus a scalar, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the denominator. Wait, perhaps the denominator is written as (c |d| - (d · v)). Because in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v), but perhaps in the problem, it's written as (c |d| - d · v). If that's the case, then the denominator is a scalar, and option C would make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is written as (c (t - t_r) - (d · v)/c ), which when t - t_r = |d|/c, becomes |d| - (d · v)/c.

So the scalar potential would be:

V = (q/(4π ε₀ )) * 1 / ( |d| - (d · v)/c )

Which can be rewritten as (q c )/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - d · v) )

Because multiply numerator and denominator by c:

( q/(4π ε₀) ) * c / [ c |d| - d · v ]

So the denominator becomes (c |d| - d · v ), and the numerator is q c.

So V becomes (q c)/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - d · v) ), which matches option C's expression for V, except in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v), which is a vector minus a scalar, which seems incorrect. Unless in the problem, it's written as (c |d| - d · v), which would make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses d as the magnitude of the vector d. No, the vector d is defined as the vector from the charge's position to r. So perhaps in the problem, the denominator is (c |d| - d · v). So option C's V is (qc)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d · v)), but this would imply that (d c) is the vector d multiplied by c, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps there's a typo in option C, and the denominator should be (c |d| - d · v).

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c |d| - (d · v) ), which is a scalar.

So if we take option C's V as (q c)/(4π ε₀ (c |d| - d · v )) and A as (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (c |d| - d · v)), then that would make sense.

Wait, looking again at option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d. v)), which, if the denominator is interpreted as (c |d| - d · v), then it's correct. But as written, the denominator in option C is (d c - d · v), which is a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps the correct option isn't among the choices, but I'm supposed to pick the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the expressions wrong. Let me think about the vector potential. The vector potential is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [ v(t_r) ] / [ c (t - t_r) - (d · v(t_r) ) ]

Again, when v=0, A=0, which is correct.

So the denominator is [c (t - t_r) - (d · v(t_r) ) ].

As before, (t - t_r) = |d|/c, so denominator becomes |d| - (d · v)/c.

So,

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * 1/( |d| - (d · v)/c )

Which is,

A = (μ₀ q v c)/(4π) * 1/( c |d| - d · v )

So,

A = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π ( c |d| - d · v ) )

Which matches the A in option C if the denominator is correct.

Wait, but in option C, the denominator is (d c - d · v), so if that's (c |d| - d · v), then the expressions in option C are correct.

So, putting it all together, the correct option is C.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C's V is (qc)/(4π ε₀ (d c - d · v)), and A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

But (d c - d · v) is a vector minus a scalar, which is impossible. So perhaps the options have a typo and the denominator is (c |d| - d · v), making option C correct. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using a different notation, like d is the magnitude of the vector d, but the problem statement says d is the vector. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in the problem, the denominator is written as (c d - v d), but that might not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C. Because option C's V and A have the right forms, assuming the denominator is correct.

Wait, but in option C, the denominator for V is (d c - d · v), which is a vector. That can't be right because the denominator in the potential expressions must be a scalar. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option D. Let me check option D again.

Option D: V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c + d · v) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c + d · v) ).

But again, the denominator is (d c + d · v), which is a vector plus a scalar, which is impossible. So that can't be correct either.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again about the general form. The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(c (t - t_r) - (d · v)/c ) ]

Which is,

V(r, t) = (q c )/(4πε₀ (c (t - t_r) c - d · v ) )

Wait, no. Because c(t - t_r) - (d · v)/c = [c^2 (t - t_r) - d · v ] / c.

So,

V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1 / [ (c^2 (t - t_r) - d · v ) / c ]

Which is,

V(r,t) = (q c )/(4πε₀ (c^2 (t - t_r) - d · v) )

But since t - t_r = |d|/c,

c^2 (t - t_r) = c |d|.

So,

V(r,t) = (q c )/(4πε₀ (c |d| - d · v ) )

Which matches option C's V expression if the denominator is (c |d| - d · v). So option C's V is correct if the denominator is interpreted correctly.

But the same applies to A. The vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * v / [ c (t - t_r) - (d · v)/c ]

Which, substituting t - t_r = |d|/c,

Denominator becomes |d| - (d · v)/c.

Expressed as [c |d| - d · v ] / c.

So,

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * v * c / [c |d| - d · v ]

Which is,

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (c |d| - d · v ) )

Which matches option C's A expression if the denominator is as such.

But in option C, the denominator is written as (d c - d · v), which is a vector minus a scalar. So perhaps the problem made a mistake in the notation, and the correct option is C, assuming that the denominator is correctly (c |d| - d · v).

Alternatively, perhaps the vector d is being treated as a scalar here, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, even though the notation seems off.

Given the options, option C seems to have the correct functional form, assuming that the denominator is intended to be (c |d| - d · v), which would make everything scalar.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge moves with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), and the field is observed at position \( \vec{r} \) and time \( t > t_r \). The vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge is derived from the retarded potential formulation. It depends on the charge's position and velocity at \( t_r \), as well as the distance \( \vec{d} \) to the observation point.
   - The general expression for \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) is:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{c |d| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
     \]
     where \( |d| = |\vec{d}| \) is the magnitude of \( \vec{d} \). This ensures the denominator is a scalar, as required for a potential.
   - In the options, this is represented as:
     \[
     V(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{q c}{4\pi\epsilon_0 (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}
     \]
     which matches the expected form if the denominator is interpreted as \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and depends on the same denominator as \( V(\vec{r}, t) \). The general expression is:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{c |d| - \frac{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}}{c}}
     \]
   - Substituting \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) as the denominator, this becomes:
     \[
     \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \frac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4\pi (c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})}
     \]
   - This matches the form given in option C for \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \).

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option A:** The expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) do not account for the motion of the charge, as they use a static Coulomb potential and incorrectly relate \( \vec{A} \) to \( \vec{v}^2 \). This is incorrect.
   - **Option B:** Similar to option A, it uses a static Coulomb potential for \( V \) and incorrectly relates \( \vec{A} \) to \( \vec{v} \). This is also incorrect.
   - **Option C:** The expressions for \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) have the correct functional dependence on \( \vec{d} \), \( \vec{v} \), and the physical constants. The denominator \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) is scalar, ensuring dimensional consistency. This is the correct option.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) is \( c |d| + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is incorrect because the correct denominator involves subtraction, not addition. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the correct expressions for both the scalar and vector potentials, assuming the denominator is interpreted as \( c |d| - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is consistent with the retarded potential formulation.

**Answer: C**
