Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think this through. Okay, the question is asking about the orbital periods of two planets, planet #1 and planet #2. Both are around stars with the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune. So, the stars are similar to our Sun, which might mean their masses are about the same, but I should confirm that.

The problem says that the RV method was used. Radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us. The size of this shift is related to the planet's mass and the characteristics of the orbit.

So, planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period of the planet? I think the key here is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, which is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_*))^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 day))^(1/3) * (1 AU)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should recall a more simplified version. Oh wait, for circular orbits (e=0), the formula simplifies. Also, since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula might simplify.

The simplified formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) )) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law. Kepler's
