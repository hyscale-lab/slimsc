Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

Alright, the setup: two stars with the same mass (like our Sun), each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. They're using the RV method, which measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum due to the planet's orbit. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. But since both planets are in circular orbits and the stars have the same mass, maybe inclination isn't a factor here? Or perhaps the shifts are related to the actual velocity, so maybe the shifts are a measure of the star's velocity.

The RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us. The formula I'm recalling is that the semi-amplitude K of the velocity is given by some relation involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis) of the planet.

Wait, let's think about the formula. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )

But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune and stars are much more massive (like the Sun), M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the equation simplifies a bit.

Alternatively, I remember that the formula can be approximated as:

K = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_J) ) * ( (M_* / M_sun) )^(-2/3) ) * (P / year )^(-1/3) )

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact constants, but perhaps another approach is better. Since both stars have the same mass, M_*, and the planets have the same mass (Neptune-like), M_p is the same for both. But their velocity semi-amplit
