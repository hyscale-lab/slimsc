Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electric potential energy involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R, what's the net potential energy of the system? The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with a conducting sphere, the charge on it distributes itself in a particular way. Oh right, a conducting sphere will have the charge induced on its surface. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can flow to the ground. Oh wait wait, no, wait. Wait, a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium has charges on the surface. But if it's grounded, any excess charge can leave, so the conductor's potential is the same as the ground's potential, which is usually taken as zero.

So if the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would adjust until the potential on the sphere is zero. But in this case, we have a charge q placed near the sphere. So the induced charges on the sphere will be such that the total potential at the sphere's surface is zero.

But wait, the system's potential energy comes from the interactions between the charges. So the potential energy should be the work done to bring the charges into place.

Wait, the setup is: a single charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere. The sphere is grounded, so any induced charges can go into the ground. But wait, no, because the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges will be on its
