Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and electron transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities.

Wait, dipole transitions... right, I remember that the transition of an electron between energy levels in a hydrogen atom is governed by the selection rules. Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0 (which means it's an s-orbital), m=0. We need to find a two-step transition to |1,0,0>, which is n=1, l=0, m=0.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. If the initial state is l=0, and each dipole transition changes l by ±1, then from l=0, the first transition must go to l=1, right? Because it can't go to l=-1, since l can't be negative. So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1.

Similarly, the second transition would need to bring l from 1 to 0, because the final state is l=0. So the overall process goes 0 → 1 → 0. That makes sense for two dipole steps.

So the first transition: from |3,0,0> to |2,1,m>. Because n decreases by 1 each time? Wait, not necessarily. The selection rules don't specify about n changing, but in practice, the energy levels are such that lower n has lower energy. So in a two-photon transition, you can't go from n=3 to n=1 in one step because that would require emitting two photons, but each dipole transition emits one photon. So the steps are n=3 → n=2 → n=1.

Wait, but wait again. No, that's not necessarily the case. The selection rules don't restrict the change in n as long as l is changing by ±1. But
