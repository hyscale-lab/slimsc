Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let's see what the question is about.

So, we have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r < R, the cavity is entirely within the conductor. 

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options are given, and I need to pick the correct expression for E.

Alright, let's think about what I know. When a conductor is uncharged and a charge is placed inside a cavity, the conductor adjusts its charges to maintain electrostatic conditions. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, right. So the cavity has a charge +q. Since the conductor was initially neutral, the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have an induced charge of -q. Then, because the total charge on the conductor is zero (since it's uncharged), the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner induced -q and the outer +q would cancel each other out, keeping the conductor's net charge zero.

Now, about the electric field outside the conductor. I remember Gauss's Law here. For a Gaussian surface outside the conductor (since P is outside), the total enclosed charge would be the sum of any charges inside. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Because the conductor's inner surface is -q, and the outer is +q, so the net is zero, but the outer +q contributes to the field.

Wait, no. Wait. The Gaussian surface outside the conductor would enclose the entire conductor, so the total charge enclosed is the charge on the conductor, which is zero because the conductor was uncharged. Wait, but that's confusing because the cavity's charge is inside the conductor. Or, noâ€”the conductor's own charges are on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. When the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q (induced by the +q), and the outer surface will have +q to balance, so that the conductor remains neutral. So, when considering a point outside the conductor, the enclosed charge is the sum of all charges inside the Gaussian surface. The +q on the outer surface is outside? No, wait, the Gaussian surface is outside, so the outer surface charge is inside the surface. Wait, no, wait: The Gaussian surface is a sphere that encloses the conductor. So, the charges on the conductor's outer surface are inside the Gaussian surface. But the conductor's total charge is zero, so the Gaussian surface encloses zero charge. Wait,
