Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's spectrum and the comoving distance. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

Alright, the question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths than that, the flux drops a lot. Wait, I remember that quasars often exhibit emission lines, and the Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent one. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, but if the quasar is at a high redshift, that line could be redshifted into the optical or infrared.

The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121.6 nm. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's way longer. Let me calculate the redshift. The formula is redshift z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately... let's see, 790/120 is about 6.58, so 6.58 minus 1 is 5.58. So z is around 5.58.

Wait, but the peak is at 790 nm. Oh wait, if the peak is the Lyman-alpha emission line, then that's correct. So the redshift z is about 5.58.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth. The comoving distance D_C is a measure of the distance in the universe's expanding geometry. To find D_C for a given redshift, we need to integrate over the expansion history. But since the parameters are given as per the Lambda-CDM model, with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_Λ=0.7, and flat universe (Ω_total=1), we can use standard cosmological calculators or formulas.

But wait, I don't have the exact formula memorized. I think the comoving distance depends on the integral of 1/(H(a)) da from a=0 to a=1/(1+z), where a is the scale factor. But calculating that integral exactly is complicated without a calculator. Alternatively, maybe I can remember some approximate distances for certain redshifts.

Redshifts around 5 are pretty high. At z=5, the comoving distance is something like ~
