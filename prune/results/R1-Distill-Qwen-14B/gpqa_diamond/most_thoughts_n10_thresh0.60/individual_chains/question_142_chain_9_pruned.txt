Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question gives a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (like a statistical mixture of pure states) rather than pure. So this rho must be a mixed state because it's a combination of two projectors.

Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a single qubit? Oh right, a single qubit density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is something like [[a, b], [c, d]], but I think for this specific case, maybe it's diagonal because the terms are |0><0| and |1><1|.

Let me write out |0><0| and |1><1|. |0> is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So when I add them and multiply by 1/2, rho becomes (1/2)*[[1,0],[0,0]] + (1/2)*[[0,0],[0,1]], right?

Adding those matrices gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So rho is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position in the qubit space? I think qubit states are often represented on the Bloch sphere. But wait, density matrices are more general. The Bloch sphere is for pure states, but rho represents a mixed state here. So how do density matrices fit into the Bloch sphere picture?

I remember that any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The general form is rho = (I + r · σ) / 2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector with components (x, y, z). So r specifies the point on the Bloch sphere.

So to find r, I can express rho in terms of the identity matrix and the Pauli matrices. Let me do that.

The given rho is [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. Let's see if this matches the
