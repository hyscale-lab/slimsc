Alright, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. But let's break it down step by step.

The question is about the para-isomer yield in monobromination reactions for six different aromatic compounds. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing a different order.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—either ortho, meta, or para. The directing effects depend on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's an electron-donating or -withdrawing group.

So, each substituent in the given compounds will influence where the bromine adds. For each compound, I need to determine whether the substituent is activating or deactivating and whether it's meta or para directing.

Let's list out each compound and their substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The substituent is a methyl group.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: This is ethyl benzoate. The substituent is an ester group (O-CO-O-).
3) C6H5-Cl: This is chlorobenzene. Substituent is Cl.
4) C6H5-NO2: This is nitrobenzene. Substituent is NO2.
5) C6H5-C2H5: This is ethylbenzene. Substituent is ethyl.
6) C6H5-COOH: This is benzoic acid. Substituent is COOH.

Now, I'll analyze each substituent's effect.

1) Methyl (CH3): It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. Such groups are ortho/para directors. So, in reactions, the incoming electrophile (like Br+) will tend to add at the ortho or para positions relative to the methyl group. However, since it's a meta director? Wait, no, activating groups are ortho/para directors. So, for toluene, the major products would be para and ortho isomers. But wait, the methyl group is a strong activating group, so para is a major position.

2) Ethyl benzoate (COOEt): The ester group is a substituent. Esters are usually electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl group. So, they are deactivating. But wait, the ester group has an oxygen, which can donate electrons through resonance? Or is it more like a meta director? Let me think. The ester group (like COOR) is an electron-withdrawing group because the carbonyl is more electronegative. So it's a deactivating (making the ring less reactive) and meta-directing group. So, the incoming Br would add meta to the ester group.

3) Chlorine (Cl): It's a substituent. Chlorine is a halogen, which is an interesting case. Because Cl is more electronegative than the carbon, it has a -I effect (electron-withdrawing), making the ring less reactive. But it also has a +R effect (resonance donating), which can donate some electrons when possible. Because the ring is aromatic, the +R effect is possible. Wait, for Cl attached to benzene, the overall effect is deactivating because the -I is stronger than +R. So Cl is a deactivating group and an ortho/para director. Hmm, wait, but wait—Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So in reactions, the ring is less reactive, but substitution occurs at ortho and para positions.

4) Nitro group (NO2): This is a strong deactivating group, due to both -I and -R effects. It's a meta-directing group. So the Br would add meta to the nitro group.

5) Ethyl (C2H5): This is an alkyl group, similar to methyl. It's activating (electron-donating via +I effect), so it's an ortho/para director. So the Br would add mainly at ortho and para positions.

6) Carboxylic acid (COOH): This group is deactivating because the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the COOH group (both -I and -R effects). It's a meta-directing group. So Br would add meta to the COOH.

Wait, but I need to think about the directing effect for each substituent because the para-isomer's yield depends on whether the substituent directs the incoming group to the para position and whether steric factors or other effects might influence the ratio between para and other isomers.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, we need to determine the percentage of para product formed.

Factors that increase para product yield:

- If the substituent is an ortho/para director, then para is a major product, but ortho can also be formed, especially if steric hindrance is minimal.

Wait, but for groups like NO2, which are meta directors, the para position isn't a main site.

So, the para yield depends on the substituent's directing effects. Let me create a table for each substituent.

Substituent | Activating/Deactivating | Director (ortho, meta, para)
--- | --- | ---
CH3 | Activating (ortho/para) | Ortho/Para
COOEt | Deactivating (meta) | Meta
Cl | Deactivating (ortho/para) | Ortho/Para (but deactivating)
NO2 | Deactivating (meta) | Meta
C2H5 | Activating (ortho/para) | Ortho/Para
COOH | Deactivating (meta) | Meta

Wait, wait. Let's clarify each substituent's effect:

1. CH3 (methyl): Activating, ortho/para director. So the bromine can attack para and ortho. Since the ring is activated, the reaction is more likely. But the substituent is bulky? Methyl is small, so perhaps not too bad for ortho attack. So the para isomer may be a major product.

2. COOEt (ester): Deactivating, meta director. So the bromine goes meta to the ester. So, no para isomer here—since the incoming group goes meta, which could be either meta to the substituent, but in a benzene ring, the substituent can have multiple positions. Wait, no, the substituent is in one position, so the bromine can go in positions 2,4,6 (assuming substituent is at position 1). Let me think: on a benzene ring with a substituent at position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. So for a meta director, the bromine would add at either 3 or 5. So, the para position relative to substituent 1 would be position 4. Wait, but if the substituent is at position 1, adding at position 4 is para. So the director's effect determines whether the substituent is added at ortho, meta, or para positions. So for a meta director, the substituent adds meta, which is positions 3 and 5. So, for COOEt, the bromine adds meta, so no para product. So para isomer is zero? Or wait, no, wait: if the substituent is in position 1, the meta positions are 3 and 5. So, the bromine would add either at 3 or 5. So the product is either the 3-bromo or 5-bromo, but both are meta. So the para position (4) is not the site of substitution. So the para isomer isn't formed. So the weight fraction of para isomer is zero for this case?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Electrophilic substitution in benzene derivatives: the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to specific positions.

So, when substituent directs meta, the electrophile adds meta to it. So for substituent at position 1, the electrophile adds at 3 or 5. So the para position is 4, which is not a target. So for substituents that are meta directors, the para isomer isn't formed. So in this case, for COOEt (ester), the para isomer is not formed. So the fraction is zero.

Similarly, nitro group (NO2) is a meta director, so the para isomer is not formed.

Wait, but wait—what about substituents that are ortho/para directors but deactivating? For example, Cl is deactivating but ortho/para director. So, in such cases, the para isomer is formed, but because the ring is deactivating, the reaction is slower. But in the question, the bromine is in excess, so it's a monobromination. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, whether activating or deactivating, the para position is a possible site. So for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is formed, but the relative amount depends on the substituent's effect.

So, the para fraction would be highest for substituents that are ortho/para directors and have minimal steric hindrance, allowing the para position to be more favored.

Let me outline each substituent's effect on para-isomer yield:

1. CH3 (toluene): ortho/para director, activating. So para is a major product. How much? Since it's activating, the reaction is faster, but since it's ortho/para, the product distribution would have more para than meta or ortho. Wait, but in a benzene ring, the para position is only one position, while ortho are two positions. So when the substituent is ortho/para director, the major product is ortho and para. However, when the substituent is strong activating (like CH3), para tends to be the major product because of steric hindrance in the ortho positions. Wait, no—actually, in toluene, the activating groups are ortho/para directors, but para is typically the major product due to less steric hindrance compared to ortho. So for toluene, the para isomer is the major product. So a high yield of para.

2. COOEt (ester): meta director. So para isn't formed. So para fraction is zero.

3. Cl: ortho/para director, but deactivating. So para is formed, but since the ring is less reactive, the reaction is slower. But bromine is in excess, so it's a monobromination. The para product is formed, but perhaps the amount is less than in the case of activating groups. So in chlorobenzene, the para isomer is formed, but perhaps not as much as in toluene. Wait, but directing is more important than activation. For substituents that are ortho/para but deactivating, the para is formed, but the fraction depends on the substituent's influence.

Wait, but in the case of Cl, because it's a deactivating substituent, the overall reaction is slower, but since it's a meta/para director, no, Cl is ortho/para. So in chlorobenzene, the substituent directs the incoming Br to ortho and para positions. So the para is formed, but perhaps the para product is the major one because ortho might have steric issues. So the para fraction is high, but maybe not as high as in toluene.

4. NO2: meta director. So no para isomer. So para fraction is zero.

5. C2H5 (ethylbenzene): alkyl group, activating, ortho/para director. Like toluene, so para is the major product.

6. COOH (carboxylic acid): deactivating, meta director. So no para isomer. Para fraction is zero.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me make a list of the substituent and the presence of para isomer:

Substance | Para Isomer Formed?
--- | ---
1 (CH3) | Yes
2 (COOEt) | No
3 (Cl) | Yes
4 (NO2) | No
5 (C2H5) | Yes
6 (COOH) | No

So, substances 1,3,5 form para isomers; 2,4,6 do not. So among the six, their weight fractions of para isomers are as follows:

Substance 2,4,6: 0% para.

Substance 1,3,5: >0% para.

Now, we need to arrange all six in order of increasing para fraction. So the ones with 0% will come first, then the ones with higher percentages.

But wait, the question asks for the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for substances 2,4,6, the fraction is 0. So they are the lowest in the order.

But wait, no. Because the question says "monobromo derivative is formed", so for each, only one product is formed? No, it's assumed that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Or wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed"—so each reaction produces a single product? No, wait, perhaps the bromine is in excess but only one monobromo is formed, meaning that perhaps the reaction is under conditions where only the major product is formed, and others are negligible. Or perhaps it's a monobromination but only considering the major product. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps each substituent directs the bromine to certain positions, and for each, the major product is considered. So for each compound, the major product is either para, ortho, or meta. But in the case of ortho/para directors, the para is the major product.

Wait, but for the substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is the major product. For meta directors, the meta isomer is major, and thus, no para. So:

1) Toluene: major is para (so para fraction is high).

3) Chlorobenzene: major is para (since it's ortho/para director but deactivating).

5) Ethylbenzene: major is para.

So their para fractions are high.

Now, among these, which has the highest para fraction? Let me think about the directing effects and activation.

Toluene (CH3) is strongly activating, so the reaction is more reactive, and the para is the major product. Similarly, ethylbenzene is activating but perhaps less activating than toluene? Or wait, ethyl is a bigger group than methyl, so maybe the para is the major product but perhaps less than toluene. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the activating groups increase the rate of reaction. So, for toluene and ethylbenzene, the reaction is faster, but the product distribution is more influenced by the substituent's directing effect.

Wait, but the percentage of para vs ortho in toluene is about 60% para and 40% ortho. Not sure about the exact numbers, but I remember that in toluene, the para isomer is major. Similarly in ethylbenzene, para is the major product.

Chlorobenzene: the substituent is deactivating but ortho/para director. The reaction is slower, but the para isomer is the major product. So, I think the para fraction is lower than that of toluene and ethylbenzene because the ring is less reactive, but it's still the major product.

So, arranging the para fractions:

For 1,3,5:

1) Toluene (CH3): highest para fraction.

5) Ethylbenzene: next highest.

3) Chlorobenzene: lowest para fraction among the three.

Wait, but wait—could ethyl group be less activating than methyl? No, I think all alkyl groups are activating, but larger groups may have a stronger activating effect. Or perhaps it's the opposite. Hmm, I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the size of the alkyl group: larger groups like ethyl are better at donating electrons via the inductive effect. So, perhaps ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl. So ethyl would have a higher para fraction than toluene. But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is primarily determined by the directing effect rather than the activating power. So, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is major, but the fraction may vary based on steric factors.

In toluene, the methyl group is small, so the para position is less hindered, making para the major product. In ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is larger, so the ortho positions may be more hindered, leading to even higher para selectivity. So, perhaps ethylbenzene has a higher para fraction than toluene.

But I'm not certain. Let's think again. In the case of toluene, the para isomer is about 60%, meta negligible, and ortho about 40%. For ethylbenzene, since the ethyl group is bulkier, the ortho positions might be harder to approach, leading to a higher para fraction. So, perhaps ethylbenzene's para fraction is higher than toluene's.

Alternatively, perhaps toluene's para is around 50% and ethyl's around 70%? I'm not entirely sure, but this affects the order.

So, considering all this:

Substances that don't produce para isomers: 2 (COOEt), 4 (NO2),6 (COOH). So their para fractions are zero. So, in the order, they come first.

Then, the ones that do produce para isomers: 1 (CH3),3 (Cl),5 (C2H5).

Now, putting them in order of increasing para fraction: the ones with lower para fraction first.

So, the order for para fractions:

Lowest para fraction: 3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) <5 (C2H5) ?

Wait, but earlier I was considering that ethylbenzene (5) may have a higher para fraction than toluene (1). So, perhaps the order is 3 <1 <5.

So, the overall order would be:

2,4,6 (0% para) → 3 (Cl, low para) →1 (CH3, higher para) →5 (C2H5, highest para).

So, the order of increasing para fractions is: 2,4,6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but the options given are A, B, C, D.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4 <2<6<3<1<5

No, because 4,2,6 are zero, so they should come first.

Option B:6 <2<4<5<1<3 → No, because 5 and 1 have higher para fractions.

Option C:4<6<2<1<5<3 → No, because 3 has lower than 1.

Option D:3<5<1<6<2<4 → No, doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituents.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5 → 4,2,6 are zero, then 3,1,5.

But according to our analysis, 3 has the lowest para fraction, followed by 1, then 5.

So the order would be 4<2<6<3<1<5, which is option A.

But earlier I thought that 3's para fraction is lower than 1 and 5.

Wait, but let's revisit each substituent's effect.

Substance 3 is chlorobenzene (Cl). Cl is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Due to steric hindrance, the para position might be less hindered than the ortho positions. So the para isomer is the major product, but the ring's deactivation makes the reaction slower. So, the para fraction is significant but perhaps less than in activating groups.

Substance 1 is toluene (CH3). Activating and ortho/para, so higher para fraction.

Substance5 is ethylbenzene (C2H5). Also activating and ortho/para, but larger substituent, perhaps leading to even higher para fraction.

So, the para fraction order is 3 <1 <5.

So, the overall order of the six substances is:

Substances with zero para: 4,2,6 → with 3 (lowest para), then 1, then 5 (highest para).

So the order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But wait, option A says 4<2<6, but 4 (NO2) and 2 (COOEt) and 6 (COOH) all have zero para. So their order among themselves doesn't matter for the overall arrangement, as they all have the same (zero) para fraction. But the options present a specific order.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Are any of 2,4,6 having any para isomer?

No, because they're meta directors. So, for each of 2,4,6, their para fraction would be zero.

So, the order for increasing para fraction is:

4,2,6 (all zero) →3 (Cl) →1 (CH3) →5 (C2H5).

So, the sequence is 4,2,6,3,1,5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. Which matches.

So the correct order is option A.

Wait, but why is option A in that order? Because the question is about increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer, so the order starts with the lowest. The three substances (4,2,6) have zero para, so they are the lowest. Then comes 3, which has some para, then 1, then 5.

So the correct order is 4 < 2 < 6 <3 <1 <5.

But wait, the question is about the weight fraction, so for the three with zero, their order among themselves doesn't affect the overall arrangement. So, whether it's 4 <2 <6 or any other order, their order is irrelevant as they all have zero. But the options give a specific order.

Looking back, the question says to arrange in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the three with zero are all tied, but in the options, they appear in different orders.

In option A, it's 4 <2 <6 <3<1<5.

In option B, 6 <2 <4 <5 <1 <3.

In option C, 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

In option D, 3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4.

So, according to the analysis, the correct order is 4,2,6 (all zero), then 3, then 1, then 5.

Thus, the correct sequence is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5, which is option A.


To determine the order of substances based on the increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in their monobromination products, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents on the benzene ring. Substituents can be ortho/para directors (activating or deactivating) or meta directors (electron-withdrawing groups). The para-isomer yield depends on whether the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to the para position and how strongly it activates or deactivates the ring.

### Analysis of Each Compound:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**:  
   The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. It strongly activates the ring, and due to minimal steric hindrance, the para-isomer is the major product.  

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**:  
   The ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It directs the electrophile to the meta positions, so no para-isomer is formed.  

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**:  
   The chlorine atom is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. While the ring is less reactive, the para-isomer is still formed as the major product due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.  

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**:  
   The nitro group is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. It directs the electrophile to the meta positions, so no para-isomer is formed.  

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**:  
   The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Similar to toluene, the para-isomer is the major product, but the larger size of the ethyl group increases steric hindrance at the ortho positions, leading to a slightly higher para-isomer yield compared to toluene.  

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**:  
   The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. It directs the electrophile to the meta positions, so no para-isomer is formed.  

### Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Yield:
- **Substances with no para-isomer**: 4 (NO2), 2 (COOEt), 6 (COOH) (all have 0% para-isomer).  
- **Substances with low para-isomer yield**: 3 (Cl).  
- **Substances with higher para-isomer yield**: 1 (CH3).  
- **Substance with the highest para-isomer yield**: 5 (C2H5).  

Thus, the order of increasing para-isomer yield is: **4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Correct Option:
**A) 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

Answer: A
