Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the product is after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. The cyclohexanone ring has a hydroxymethyl group at position 3 and a propenyl group at position 5. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2?), no, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is CH2- attached to the cyclohexane at position 5. Wait, no. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH3)-, right? Oh wait, no. The structure is CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C-CH2-, but that can't be. Oh wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)2CH with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. So, structure is CH
