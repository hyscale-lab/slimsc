Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. 

Alright, so the decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are various lengths, so the resolution is probably related to the distance the particles travel before decaying, and how that relates to the detector's resolution.

I remember that in particle physics, the lifetime of a particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. The formula for that is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is calculated as E/(m c²), since the total energy E is the relativistic energy which includes the rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, but the mass is given in GeV, and the energy is also in GeV. Oh, right, because in particle physics, energy and mass are often expressed in the same units, so when you have E in GeV and m in GeV/c², the c² is accounted for in the units.

So, first, let me calculate γ. The energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So, γ = E / (m c²) but since both are in GeV, the c² cancels out when units are handled correctly. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41, let's see, 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87. 3.41 * 8 is 27.28. Oh wait, so 27 is a bit less than 8 times 3.41. 27 / 3.41 equals approximately 7.91. So γ is around 7.91.

Next, the lifetime τ in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that: 7.91 *8 is about 63.28, so τ ≈ 6.328e-15 seconds.

Now, the particles would travel a certain distance before decaying. The distance L is c multiplied by τ. Wait, but only if they're moving at the speed of light. Since these are high-energy particles, they're moving very close to c. So L = c * τ.

But wait, what's the speed? Well, for high-energy particles (like those with E much larger than m c²), the speed v is approximately c. So we can take v ≈ c.

So L = c * τ = (3e8 m/s) * (6.328e-15 s) = 3e8 * 6.328e-15. Let's compute that. 3e8 is 3
