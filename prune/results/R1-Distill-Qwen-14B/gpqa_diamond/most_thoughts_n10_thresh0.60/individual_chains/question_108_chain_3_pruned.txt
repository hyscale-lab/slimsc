Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, right, paramagnetism involves the interaction of magnetic fields with electron spins, I think. 

The magnetic field B is given as 1 Tesla, which is pretty strong, but wait, I remember that paramagnetism effects are usually small because the energy involved is much less than other terms. Oh, but the question is about the order of magnitude.

The setup is a magnetic field parallel to the Oz axis. Oh, so it's along the z-axis. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum, right? It can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. So small m would be like m=0 or maybe m=1. But I'm not sure how that plays into this.

The problem asks about the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy ΔE. I think the paramagnetic term refers to the energy due to the magnetic interaction. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom, given by the wavelength λ=0.4861 μm. Oh, wait, that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is around 656 nm, but wait no, 0.4861 μm is 486 nm, which is the Balmer beta line, like the second emission line in the visible spectrum. But maybe I should just compute the energy ΔE from that wavelength.

So, first, let's compute the energy ΔE. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light. Let me think about the constants: h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, c is about 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters (since 1 μm is 1e-6 m, so 0.4861 μm is 486.1 nm).

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m). Let's compute that. Numerator is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 0.4861e-6 m: 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.088e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, energy levels in hydrogen are on the order of eV, right? Because 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J is approximately 2.55 eV. That seems high because hydrogen's energy levels are usually a few eV apart. Wait, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 0.4861e-6 meters is 4.861e-7 meters. So 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 4.861e-7 m gives 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.088e-19 J. Converting to eV: 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a big energy jump. I thought hydrogen's transitions are usually smaller, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, the Balmer series is between n=2 and higher states, so n=2 to n=1 is about 102.6 nm, but wait, the given wavelength is 486 nm, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2. So the energy difference should be about 2.55 eV? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the Rydberg formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe I should just proceed with the calculation as given.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term, which is the energy due to the magnetic field interacting with the electron's magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ can be given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, for paramagnetism, the relevant term is the Zeeman effect, which splits energy levels based on the magnetic quantum number. The energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = -μ·B. Alternatively, the paramagnetic term might be proportional to m, the orbital quantum number, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, paramagnetism is due to the spin magnetic dipole, so the energy should be something like ΔE_para = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment due to spin. The spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is ±1/2. So the energy term would be proportional to m_s. But in this question, we're given m as the orbital magnetic quantum number, which is different. Wait, the problem says "small values of m", so m here might be the orbital m, not the spin m_s. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but wait, m is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum. So the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is μ_orbital = μ_l = (eħ/(2m_e)) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m (some expression), but I think the paramagnetic term is usually from the spin, not the orbital part. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the perturbation due to the magnetic field. So the paramagnetic term would be the perturbing Hamiltonian due to B. The Hamiltonian is H_para = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, μ = -g μ_B m_s, so H_para = g μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but if m is small, like m=0, maybe the orbital part doesn't contribute much, but the spin part still exists. But the question states m is small, but it's the orbital m, right? So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term is from the spin, which is m_s = ±1/2, but the orbital m is small, like m=0, so the orbital contribution is zero. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic term is the spin-orbit coupling, but I think that's different. Spin-orbit coupling is a separate effect and usually considered in fine structure. But the question is about paramagnetic coupling due to the magnetic field.

Wait, perhaps the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman effect splits energy levels based on the magnetic quantum number. The energy shift is ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B B m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, if m is small, like 0, then the shift is zero, but that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's proportional to m_l, the orbital m, but that might be part of the orbital contribution. But in the paramagnetic effect, the spin is the main contributor. So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling is from the spin, so m_s is ±1/2, so the energy shift would be on the order of μ_B * B.

So let's compute the paramagnetic energy term. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So H_para = μ_B * B * m_s. Wait, but m_s is only ±1/2, so the maximum shift would be μ
