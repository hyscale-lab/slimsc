Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question says that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating the average value you'd expect to measure in an experiment. For an observable like S_y, the expectation value is found using the formula involving the bra-ket notation. Oh wait, right, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector again.

The state given is (3i, 4). Let me write that down as a column vector. So the state vector ψ is:

|ψ> = [ 3i ]
        [ 4 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the notation can be a bit tricky. The state is (3i, 4), so in vector form it's a 2-element vector, where the first element is 3i and the second is 4. So when I write it as a column vector, yes, it's (3i; 4). But when calculating the expectation value, I think I need the conjugate transpose, so the bra vector. So the bra would be the conjugate of the transpose of this. Let me think: the transpose of [3i;4] is [3i, 4], and the conjugate would be [-3i, 4], because the conjugate of 3i is -3i. So the bra vector is [-3i, 4].

The operator for spin in the y-direction is given as σ_y, which is the Pauli matrix:

σ_y = [ [0, -i],
         [i, 0] ]

So the expectation value <S_y> is given by <ψ| σ_y |ψ> multiplied by ħ/2, right? Wait, because in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ. Oh wait, right, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So σ_y is the Pauli matrix, but the actual operator is (ħ/2) σ_y.

Or wait, does the given σ_y already include the ħ/2 factor? No, the problem states that σ_y is as given, so I think the operator S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So when calculating <S_y>, I compute (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

So the steps are: compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ>, multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value of S_y.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute σ_y |ψ>.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply σ_y by |ψ> = [3i; 4], I get:

First element: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = -4i
Second element: i*(3i) + 0*4 = i*(3i) = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y |ψ> is [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ> which is the conjugate transpose of |ψ> multiplied by σ_y |ψ>.

The conjugate transpose of |ψ> is [ -3i, 4 ] (since ψ is [3i;4], the conjugate is [-3i;4], and transpose makes it a row vector).

So multiply [ -3i, 4 ] with [ -4i; -3 ].

That's (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So the sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that's the result of <ψ| σ_y |ψ> = -24.

Wait, but I thought that expectation value is <σ_y> and then <S_y> is (ħ/2) times that. So:

<S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24).

Wait, that would be (-24)*(ħ/2) = -12ħ.

Wait, but the options given are fractions, like 12 hbar /25. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's double-check the steps.

Hmm, let's compute σ_y |ψ> again.

|ψ> is [3i; 4].

σ_y is [[0, -i],
         [i, 0]]

So σ_y |ψ> is [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) ; (i)(3i) + 0*(4) ]

Which is [ 0 + (-4i) ; 3i^2 + 0 ]

Wait, 3i^2 is 3*(-1) = -3.

So the components are [ -4i; -3 ].

So that's correct.

Then, <ψ| σ_y |ψ> is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

So the first term is (-3i)(-4i) = (12 i^2) = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term is 4*(-3) = -12.

Total is -24.

Wait, but the state vector must be normalized. Wait, is the given state vector normalized? Because if it isn't, then the expectation value calculation would be different.

Wait, the state is (3i,4). The norm squared is |3i|^
