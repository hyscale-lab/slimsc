Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines are important. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is a big one in quasars. But wait, Lyman-alpha is usually around 121 nm in the rest frame. But if we observe it at a longer wavelength, that means the quasar is redshifted.

Wait, but the peak here is at 790 nm. So that's in the near infrared. So maybe that's the Lyman-alpha line redshifted. Let me calculate the redshift. So the observed wavelength λ_obs is 790 nm, and the rest wavelength λ_rest is 121.6 nm (I think that's the Lyman-alpha line). So the redshift z is (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1.

Let me compute that: 790 / 121.6 is approximately 6.498. Subtract 1, so z ≈ 5.498. Wait, wait, wait. Wait no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Because if the emission line is at 790 nm, that's actually in the observed frame. So the rest frame is shorter wavelength. So the quasar is moving away, so the wavelength is
