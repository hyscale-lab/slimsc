Okay, let me try to figure this quantum mechanics problem out. So, the question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential, V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². Hmm, I remember that this is a harmonic oscillator potential. Since it's three-dimensional and isotropic, the problem should be separable into spherical coordinates, right?

Wait, the potential is like a 3D harmonic oscillator. So each direction (x, y, z) has the same potential, but in spherical coordinates, it's easier to express in terms of r, the radial distance. Oh, right, for a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized based on quantum numbers.

In three dimensions, the energy levels are given by the formula E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer. Wait, wait. No, wait, that might not be right. Because in 3D, the quantum numbers in each direction (nx, ny, nz) add up, right? So for the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, no, the energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

But another way to think about it is in terms of radial and angular parts. Wait, because in spherical
