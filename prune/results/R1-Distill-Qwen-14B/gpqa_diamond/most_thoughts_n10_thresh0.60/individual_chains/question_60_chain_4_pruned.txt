Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think. So the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super-fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to figure out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth.

Wait, time dilation comes into play here because they're moving at such a high speed. Oh right, from the astronaut's frame of reference, the distance to Earth would be contracted. So the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) would be shorter than the time observed from Earth.

But wait, how do I calculate that? I remember the time dilation formula involves the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But since v is so close to c, gamma must be really high.

So the question is about the proper time, which is the time experienced by the astronaut. The proper time tau is calculated using the formula tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in Earth's frame. Or wait, no, actually, the proper time is the shortest time and depends on the frame where the event (departure and arrival) happens at the same place. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of Earth's frame and then find the astronaut's proper time.

Wait, the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find how long they experience the trip. So from Earth's perspective, the distance is D, and the spacecraft is moving at v. Time t_earth = D / v. But the astronaut's time is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, is that correct? Because tau is the proper time, which is the time in the moving frame. Oh, right, because from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them, so the distance is contracted.

Wait, maybe another approach. The astronaut's experienced time is the coordinate time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, first I need to find the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Wait, but the problem doesn't give that distance. Oh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think in terms of the time experienced by the astronaut, so the time they age during the trip.

Wait
