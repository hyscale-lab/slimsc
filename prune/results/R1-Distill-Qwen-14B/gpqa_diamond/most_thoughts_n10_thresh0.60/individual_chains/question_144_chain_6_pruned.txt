Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that particles that decay have a mean lifetime, and from that, we can find the decay distance if we know their velocity. But wait, how does that all tie together?

So the given data is: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 16 meters. I think the decay distance formula involves the mean lifetime, velocity, and maybe some constants.

First, I should probably find the mean lifetime of the meson. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. I remember that τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Wait, more accurately, Γ is the total decay width, and τ is inversely proportional to Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, units matter here. Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. I'll need to convert that into seconds to get the proper units for time. Also, I need to make sure I use the correct value for ħ. Let me jot down the constants I'll need.

So, ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because the units for Γ are given in MeV, maybe I should convert Γ to GeV for consistency. 320 MeV is 0.32 Ge
