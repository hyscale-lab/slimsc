Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? Like, they're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the question is about the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. 

The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all numbers on the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. So I need to find the average distance this meson travels before decaying.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, the lifetime is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy (Γ) and the uncertainty in time (τ) are inversely related. So τ is approximately ħ / Γ.

Wait, but another thought—since the meson is a resonance, its decay width is given, and from that, we can find the lifetime. Oh, right, the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, actually, it's Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ is ħ divided by Γ. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so for
