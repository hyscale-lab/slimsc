Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so maybe I can calculate each part.

First, I should probably figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Wait, when you mix two solutions, the total volume changes. Oh right, initial moles of acetic acid are volume times concentration. So original volume is 20 cm³, which is 0.02 L. Concentration is 0.05 M. Moles = 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 mol.

Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. The new concentration is moles over volume, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it'll react with acetic acid (a weak acid). The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So let's find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence. The diluted acetic acid has 0.001 mol. NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 mL.

Wait, the total volume after adding NaOH will be 40 mL (diluted acid) plus 10 mL (NaOH) = 50 mL. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate ions. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate.

Sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

To find the pH, I'll calculate the concentration of acetate ions. Moles of acetate = 0.001 mol (same as original acetic acid). Volume is 50 mL (0.05 L), so concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The Kb can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Using the formula for weak base concentration: [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C). So sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98, so pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but none of the options have 9.02. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate that. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kw is
