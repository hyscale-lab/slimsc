Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix is located in the qubit space. Hmm, the question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

Wait, but I've also heard about the Bloch sphere representation for qubits. Oh right! For a single qubit, pure states can be represented as points on a unit sphere. But density matrices describe more general states, including mixed ones. So I think the Bloch sphere is for pure states, and mixed states are represented as points in a higher-dimensional space, maybe like a 3D space.

Density matrices have certain properties. They should be positive semi-definite, have trace 1, and be Hermitian. Let me check the given ρ. The trace would be (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1, so that's good. It's definitely Hermitian because it's a sum of outer products of basis states. Positive semi-definite as well because all eigenvalues are non-negative.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. I think for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in terms of the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a 3D vector and σ are the Pauli matrices. 

So, if I can write ρ in that form, I can find the vector r. Let me see: ρ = (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute each term in matrix form. 

|0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiply by 1/2: [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 0.5 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere. Now, let's express this using the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx = [[0,1],[1,0]], σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]], and I is the identity matrix.

The general form is (I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2. Let's compute each term:

I/2 is [[0.5,0], [0,0.5]].

r_x σx /2 is (r_x/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]].

Similarly for r_y σy/2 and r_z σz/2. Adding all these terms and I/2 together should give me the ρ matrix.

Let's write the sum:

ρ = (I/2) + (r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz)/2.

But our ρ is [[0.5, 0],[0, 0.5]]. So let's set the components equal.

Looking at the matrix elements:

The (1,1) element is 0.5. Let's compute that from the components. 

I/2 gives 0.5 in (1,1). The σx term: when we take r_x σx /2, the (1,1) component is zero because σx has 0s on the diagonal. Similarly, σy has 0s on the diagonal, so no contribution there. σz's (1,1) is 1, so r_z σz /2 gives (r_z/2) in (1,1). 

So adding I/2 (0.5) and r_z σz/2 (r_z/2) gives 0.5 + (r_z/2) = the (1,1) element of ρ, which is 0.5. 

So 0.5 + (r_z/2) = 0.5 → r_z/2 = 0 → r_z = 0.

Now, looking at the (1,2) element of ρ, which is zero. The (1,2) component comes from σx and σy terms. 

The (1,2) element of I/2 is zero. The σx term contributes (r_x/2) *1, since σx has 1 in (1,2). The σy term contributes (r_y/2)*(-i), but since the density matrix must be real, I think the imaginary parts must cancel out. 

Wait, wait. Because the density matrix is Hermitian, all its elements must be real and symmetric. So the (1,2) element is real. So let me think: the (1,2) part is (r_x/2) + (r_y/2)(i) ... but wait, no: the σy term has -i in (1,2), so when multiplied by r_y/2, the (1,2) element is (r_y/2)(-i). 

But since the density matrix must be real, the imaginary parts must sum to zero. So the only way this can happen is if both r_x and r_y are zero. Because if r_x is non-zero, then the (1,2) element would have a real component (r_x/2), and the σy term would have an imaginary term. 

Wait, but to make the imaginary part zero, we must have both terms cancel each other. But since r_x and r_y are real numbers, the only way their contributions sum to zero is if both are zero. Because otherwise, you'd have a real plus an imaginary term, which can't be zero unless both are zero.

So, let's see: (1,2) element of ρ is 0. The contributions are from σx and σy:

ρ_12 = (r_x/2) + (r_y/2)(-i) = real? No, because it's (r_x/2) - (i r_y /2). 

But the density matrix must be real and symmetric. So the imaginary part must be zero. Therefore, for the (1,2) element, the imaginary part would be -r_y/(2i). Wait, no, wait: Let me double-check. 

Wait, the (1,2) element of σy is -i. So when you multiply by r_y/2, the (1,2) element is r_y/2 * (-i) = (-i r_y)/2. 

The (1,2) element of σx is 1, so (r_x/2)*1 = r_x/2.

So when you add I/2 (which is 0 in (1,2)) plus σx term (r_x/2) plus σy term (-i r_y/2) plus σz term (0 in (1,2)), for the (1,2) element of rho, you get r_x/2 - i r_y/2. 

Since rho has to be real, the imaginary part must be zero. So the imaginary part is (- r_y)/2 = 0 → r_y =0. 

The real part is r_x/2, which must equal rho_12 = 0. So r_x/2 = 0 → r_x =0.

So all the components except r_z are zero. Earlier, we found r_z=0 as well. So r = (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure. So the vector is (r_x, r_y, r_z) = (0,0,0). 

So the position in the qubit space is at the origin. So which option is that?

Looking at the options: 

A) (1,1,0)
B) (0,0,1)
C) (0,0,0)
D) (1,1,1)

So the correct answer would be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with elements \([0.5, 0.5]\) on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. For a single qubit, density matrices can be expressed in terms of the Bloch sphere representation as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a 3D vector. Expanding this, the general form becomes:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1 - r_z}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), which has the form:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix},
\]

we analyze the components:

1. The diagonal elements \((1,1)\) and \((2,2)\) of \(\rho\) are both \(0.5\). From the general form, these are \(\frac{1 + r_z}{2}\) and \(\frac{1 - r_z}{2}\), respectively. Setting these equal to \(0.5\) gives \(r_z = 0\).

2. The off-diagonal elements \((1,2)\) and \((2,1)\) of \(\rho\) are both \(0\). From the general form, these are \(\frac{r_x - i r_y}{2}\) and \(\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2}\), respectively. For these to be zero, both \(r_x\) and \(r_y\) must be zero.

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), meaning the density matrix is at the origin in the qubit space.

Analyzing the options:

- **A) \((1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \((0,0,1)\):** Incorrect, as \(r_z = 0\), not \(1\).
- **C) \((0,0,0)\):** Correct, as derived above.
- **D) \((1,1,1)\):** Incorrect, as none of the components are nonzero.

The geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is at the origin.
