Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference, given a certain time in the ejecta's frame. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, so the problem says that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But since both are inertial frames, I remember that in special relativity, velocities add up according to the velocity addition formula. Hmm, right, because velocities don't just add linearly when you switch frames.

Wait, no, wait. Let's clarify. If in the Galaxy's frame (let's call it S), the ejecta is moving towards the center at some velocity v. Then in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s. So from S', the velocity of the Galaxy is u = -60,000 km/s (assuming positive is the direction the ejecta is moving in S).

Oh wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. The problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from S' (ejecta's frame), the velocity u of S (Galaxy) is -60,000 km/s. So we can use the velocity addition formula to find v, the velocity of the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame.

The velocity addition formula is u = (v - u') / (1 - (v u')/c²), but I'm a bit hazy on the exact signs. Oh wait, no, the formula depends on the direction. Let's think: we're going from S to S' moving at velocity v. So if in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v, then in S', the Galaxy is moving at u = (v) / (1 + (v/c²) * (Galaxy's velocity in S))). Wait, perhaps it's better to set up correctly.

Wait, let me write the Lorentz velocity transformations. The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²). Or is it the other way around? Wait, in this case, in the Galaxy's frame S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at velocity v. So from the
