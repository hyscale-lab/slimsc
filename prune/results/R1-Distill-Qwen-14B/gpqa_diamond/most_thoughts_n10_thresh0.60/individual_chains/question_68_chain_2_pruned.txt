Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the problem is about a spin 1/2 particle and magnetic fields. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

So, the particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma times Sz. Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction, right? So mu = gamma S_z. The initial magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That probably means the spin is up along Z.

Then, the magnetic field is suddenly turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, but same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The options are various expressions involving gamma, B, and square roots.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. What's the setup here? Initially, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. The magnetic moment mu is aligned with B, so the spin is in the eigenstate of S_z. Then, the magnetic field is switched off, but another is turned on along Y. So the magnetic field now is along Y. But why does the average of the z-component oscillate?

Oh right, in quantum mechanics, when the Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system can lead to oscillations in expectation values. Because when the state is a superposition of energy eigenstates, the probabilities can oscillate over time.

So, let me think about the initial state. Before the field is switched, the particle is in a magnetic field along Z. The spin is aligned, so the state is |↑⟩_z, an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2. But wait, wait—wait, spin 1/2, so S_z can be ± ħ/2. So initial state is |↑⟩_z.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The original Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu · B_initial. Since B_initial was along Z, H_initial was proportional to S_z. But when B is turned off and turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is H_final = -mu · B along Y. So H_final is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but mu is gamma S_z. Wait, wait—mu is defined as gamma times S_z. So mu = gamma S_z. So H_final would be mu · B, but wait, because in the magnetic field, the energy is proportional to the dot product. Wait, the energy is E = -mu · B. But in quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B, because the energy is the Zeeman effect.

Wait, actually, I think the correct formula for the Hamiltonian is H = - mu · B. But mu is given as gamma S_z. Wait, wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is usually mu = gamma S, where S is the spin. Wait, no, in this problem, mu is given as gamma multiplied by S_z. So mu = gamma S_z. So H would then be H = - mu · B, but since B is along Y, it's - mu * B * (Y component direction). Wait, but mu is a vector, right?

Wait, no. Maybe I should clarify. The
