Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the order of reactivity of these nucleophiles from most reactive to least. The nucleophiles given are 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate, hydroxide, propionate, methanol, and ethanethiolate.

Okay, first, I remember that the strength of a nucleophile depends on its ability to donate electrons. In aqueous solution, nucleophilicity is a bit tricky because polar aprotic solvents are better for nucleophilicity, but since the question specifies aqueous, we have to consider how solvation affects each nucleophile.

Let me list the nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate: That's an alkoxide ion, right? Alkoxides are strong bases and good nucleophiles. The cyclohexyl group is bulky, but it's still an alkoxide.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH-): Also a strong base and a good nucleophile. But in water, it's a weaker nucleophile than in a polar aprotic solvent because it's heavily solvated.

3. Propionate ion: That's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weak base compared to alkoxides and hydroxide because it's a larger, weaker base. So, in terms of nucleophilicity, it's probably lower.

4. Methanol: It's a neutral molecule and a poor nucleophile compared to the deprotonated species. Because in water, it doesn't have the negative charge to make it a good nucleophile. Its nucleophilicity comes from the lone pairs on the oxygen, but without the negative charge, it's less reactive.

5. Ethanethiolate (CH2CH2S-): Thiols are generally better nucleophiles than alcohols because sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen. So the ethanethiolate ion should be a strong nucleophile. Plus, in aqueous solution, thiolates are less solvated than hydroxide ions because they're bigger and maybe not as tightly held by the solvent.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, which factors dominate? Let's think about the basicity and solvation.

Alkoxides are strong bases but in water, their nucleophilicity is reduced because they're solvated. Thiolates, like ethanethiolate, are weaker bases than alkoxides but are less solvated in water, making them better nucleophiles in aqueous solution.

So ordering them:

The most reactive would be the strongest nucleophiles in aqueous. Let's list the general order of nucleophilicity in water.

In aqueous solution, the order is typically I- > Br- > Cl- (but those are halides, not our case). For oxygen and sulfur nucleophiles, the order is S- (like ethanethiolate) is a stronger nucleophile than O- (like hydroxide and alkoxide) in aqueous because the S- is less solvated.

Wait, no. Wait, I think that in a polar aprotic solvent, the order is different. In water, the order is based on how well the nucleophile is solvated. Poorly solvated nucleophiles are more reactive.

So, the bigger and more polarizable the nucleophile, the less solvated it is. So, for example, I- is a better nucleophile in polar aprotic because it's less solvated. But in aqueous, I- is worse than in aprotic because it's well-solvated.

Wait, but in our case, the nucleophiles are O- and S-. So, for O- nucleophiles, like OH-, RO-, etc., and S- nucleophiles like RS-.

In water, S- is a better nucleophile because it's less solvated. So, ethanethiolate would be more nucleophilic than hydroxide or alkoxides in aqueous solution.

So, the order for the given nucleophiles:

Ethanethiolate (5) is the most reactive. Then, among the oxygen nucleophiles, the more stabilized the base, the less nucleophilic? Hmm, no. Wait, strength of the base is inversely related to nucleophilicity in aqueous for some cases.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Strong bases are good nucleophiles. But in aqueous solution, strong bases get more stabilized, so their nucleophilicity decreases because they're solvated.

Wait, but in aqueous solution, the order is more about the base strength and solvation. So the weaker the base, the more it's a better nucleophile in aqueous because it's less stabilized.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Stronger bases are more stabilized by solvation, making them less nucleophilic in aqueous. Because they're surrounded by solvent molecules, they can't attack as effectively.

So, hydroxide is a stronger base than propionate. Propionate is a weaker base. So propionate would be a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than hydroxide? Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Because in aqueous, the stronger the base, the more it's solvated, making it a worse nucleophile. So weaker bases are better nucleophiles in aqueous.

Wait, but I think that's the case in polar aprotic solvents. In aqueous, the order is different. For example, in water, iodide is a better nucleophile than chloride even though chloride is a stronger base. Because in water, I- is less solvated, so it's a better nucleophile.

So, returning to our nucleophiles:

Ethanethiolate (5) is a weaker base than hydroxide, right? Because thiolates are weaker bases than alkoxides. Wait no, wait. Thiolates are actually weaker bases than alkoxides. For example, the pKa of ethanethiol is around 10, while the pKa of ethanol is around 19. So, the thiol is a stronger acid than ethanol, meaning its conjugate base (thiolate) is a weaker base. So, in terms of basicity: 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a stronger base than hydroxide? Not sure. Wait, the cyclohexoxide ion is a stronger base than hydroxide? Because of its bulk, maybe not. Wait, cyclohexoxide is a bulky base but is it stronger than hydroxide?

Wait, the conjugate acid of 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is 4-methylcyclohexanol. What's the pKa of cyclohexanol? I think it's around 19-20. The pKa of water is about 15.7, so hydroxide is a stronger base than cyclohexoxide. Wait, no, stronger base would mean weaker acid. Wait, if the conjugate acid of OH- is H2O, pKa ~15.7. The conjugate acid of cyclohexoxide is cyclohexanol, which has a higher pKa (weaker acid), meaning cyclohexoxide is a stronger base than OH-.

Wait, that can't be, because I thought alkanolates are stronger bases than hydroxide. Wait, no. Wait, if cyclohexanol has a higher pKa, that means it's a weaker acid. So its conjugate base (cyclohexoxide) is a stronger base than OH-.

Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, no. Let me think. The pKa of H2O is about 15
