Okay, so I have to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectral data. Hmm, let's start by looking at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. That breaks down into 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 2 oxygens. So, possible functional groups here might include esters, amides, or maybe something with an ether and a carbonyl.

Looking at the IR data first. The strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1 are probably N-H stretches. Those are usually in that region. So maybe an amide or an amine. But wait, amides typically have a broad N-H stretch, whereas amines are more of a double peak. But I think the presence of these peaks suggests either a primary or secondary amine, or an amide. The strong band at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. That could be an ester, amide, ketone, aldehyde, etc. But given the formula, maybe ester or amide.

Now looking at the 1H NMR. Let's list out the peaks:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That sounds like a methyl group attached to an oxygen, probably an ethyl group. Because a triplet at 1.2 usually corresponds to a CH2CH3 group. So maybe an ethyl ester or something like that.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm, that could be an OCH2 group. Or maybe an NH2 group, but given the IR, which showed N-H, but the broad singlet at 4.0 might not be NH. Wait, NH protons usually are broad but can also be in that region. But wait, 4.0 is a bit downfield for OCH2. Or maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H. That sounds like another CH2 group that's adjacent to another CH2. Like a CH2CH2 group. So maybe the ethyl group is split into a quartet and triplet. Wait, the 1.20 is a triplet (3H) which would fit with being a CH2CH3. Then the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would be the adjacent CH2 in ethyl, maybe attached to an oxygen. So perhaps an OCH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but wait, the quartet at 4.5 has 2H. So it's a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe the structure has an ethyl group attached via an oxygen, like an ethoxy group. Then the triplet at 1.2 is the CH3, the quartet at 4.5 is the CH2 next to the oxygen, and the triplet would be the other CH2. Wait, but in an ethoxy group, the protons adjacent to the oxygen would typically be a quartet (the OCH2CH2), but then the CH2CH3 would be a triplet. Wait, in ethoxy, the OCH2CH3 would have
