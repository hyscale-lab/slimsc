Alright, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So, I remember that in general relativity, the metric describes the geometry of spacetime. But wait, this question is about a pseudosphere, which I think is a type of surface with constant negative curvature. Oh right, pseudospheres have a metric similar to hyperbolic space.

Wait, the pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, right? So in this case, the metric is given in terms of x and y. So the line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, so this looks a bit like the metric for hyperbolic space, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

I recall that in two dimensions, the metric for hyperbolic space can be written in different coordinate systems. One common form is the Poincaré disk model, where the metric is something like ds² = [4/(1 - r²)^2] (dr² + r² dθ²), where r² = x² + y². Wait, but this metric here is for dx² + dy² multiplied by a function, so maybe it's a conformally flat metric.

Wait, let me think about the form. The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² -
