Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh, right, this looks like a 2-dimensional metric, so it's in two dimensions. But wait, pseudosphere is a term I remember from general relativity. Pseudospheres are related to anti-de Sitter space or something like that, maybe?

Wait, no, pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in this case, the metric is given in terms of x and y, so it's probably a 2D space with a specific metric. Let's see, the metric is conformally flat because it's a multiple of (dx² + dy²), which is the flat metric in 2D.

So the line element is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). The area of a pseudosphere... Oh wait, wait. Pseudosphere in 2D is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? So in 2D, the metric would be similar to the hyperbolic plane, but perhaps in a different coordinate system.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Oh wait, pseudosphere is a surface embedded in 3D, like the tractricoid, but when we talk about the area in the context of the metric given, perhaps it
