Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, right, the potential is given by V(r) = 1/2 m ω² r². Oh, wait, r is the radial distance, and it's an isotropic potential, so it's the same in all directions. That rings a bell—this is the 3D harmonic oscillator, which is a common problem in quantum mechanics.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. So I need to figure out what the energy levels are and then determine the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy) for the third excited state.

First, I remember that in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, actually, since it's isotropic, the energy levels are determined by the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in the x, y, and z directions. Or wait, no, that's for a 3D box. For a 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the principal quantum number, which is n = nx + ny + nz. Or wait, sometimes it's written in terms of the radial quantum number. Hmm, I need to get this straight.

Wait, I think the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). Oh wait, no. Wait, each dimension contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and since it's 3D, the total energy is the sum of each direction. So E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. But sometimes, people define n as nx + ny + nz, so E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So n can be 0,1,2,... and each value of n corresponds to a certain energy level.

Wait, but the states are degenerate. The degeneracy comes from the number of ways to write n = nx + ny + nz where nx, ny, nz are non-negative integers. The number of such combinations is (n + 2 choose 2), I think.
