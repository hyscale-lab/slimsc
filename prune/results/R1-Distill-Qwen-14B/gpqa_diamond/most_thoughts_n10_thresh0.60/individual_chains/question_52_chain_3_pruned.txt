Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

So the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, does that mean the overall photospheric temperature decreases? Or is it the average? I think it's the average effective temperature that's given.

Now, the main part: when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases. They're asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio is (n1)/(n2). Without spots, this ratio is higher, right? Because when the temperature decreases, the populations of the energy levels change. I remember that according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k*T) ). So if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio smaller. Because when T is lower, the denominator k*T is smaller, so the exponential term is smaller, so n1/n2 is lower.

But wait, in this problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots divided by (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

The ratio is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1. If E2 is higher than
