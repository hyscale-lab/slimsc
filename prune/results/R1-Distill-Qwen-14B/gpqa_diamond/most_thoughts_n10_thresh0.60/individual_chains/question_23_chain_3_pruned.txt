Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to understand what's going on.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, using TLC, they saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which of the options A to D are the possible products.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. Let me imagine what (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene looks like. The benzene ring has an ether group attached, right? So the oxygen is connected to the benzene and to a butenyl group. The butenyl group is 4 carbons long, with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, but but-3-enyl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4... Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Because the chain is numbered starting from the point of attachment. So the structure is CH2CH2? No, wait, more accurately, the but-3-en-1-yl group would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but butenyl is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be: CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? But wait, the substituents are at position 2. Oh, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the oxygen is attached to the benzene, and then the group is a butenyl where the substituents are on the second carbon.

So the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me break it down. The group is but-3-en-1-yl, which is four carbons with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that doesn't make sense because but-3-enyl would have only four carbons, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, but the position here is 3-en-1-yl. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond in between C3 and C4, but that seems impossible because that's beyond the chain. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of but-3-en-1-yl as CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? But that would be but-1-en-4-yl or something. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Let me think: the substituent is on the first carbon (the point of attachment is the first carbon of the butenyl group). So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's but-1-enyl. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think of but-3-en-1-yl as:

The butenyl group has four carbons. The point of attachment is carbon 1. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, four carbons can only go up to carbon 4, so if the double bond is between 3 and 4, that would be an impossible position because carbon 4 is the end. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-1-yl is actually CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. No, that can't be because butenyl can't have a double bond at position 3; that would require five carbons. Oh wait, maybe it's better
