Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to walk through my thoughts step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water. 

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm続 (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm続 of water. So first, I should probably calculate the new concentration after dilution.

Wait, right, the dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. V2 is 0.02 L (20 cm続) plus 0.02 L (20 cm続) of water, so total volume is 0.04 L. So M2 would be (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, it's about titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about two points: when 25% of the acid is neutralized and at the equivalence point.

Wait, 25% titration probably refers to 25% of the moles of acetic acid being neutralized by NaOH. So I need to find the moles in the diluted solution first.

Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. So when we titrate 25% of that, that's 0.00025 mol of NaOH reacting with it. 

Wait, but when NaOH is added, it reacts with acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio. So for each mole of NaOH added, it neutralizes a mole of acetic acid and produces a mole of acetate.

So at
