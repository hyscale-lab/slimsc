Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices, right? And F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or something similar, I think.

Wait, so the Lagrangian involves a fermion field ψ, which is a spinor, and a boson field F which is antisymmetric in mu and nu. So this looks like an interaction term between fermions and a gauge field, maybe like a photon.

Now, the question is about the mass dimension of κ. I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1), and the integral over d^4x (which has dimension -4 in mass units) requires each Lagrangian term to be dimension 4.

So let's figure out the dimensions of each part in L_int. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, let's break down each field's dimension. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2. The F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, like the electromagnetic field. The gauge field A_mu has dimension 1, so F^{mu nu} is the derivative of A plus terms, so each derivative is dimension 1. So F^{mu nu} would have dimension 2, because it's the derivative acting on A.

Wait, let me think again. F^{mu nu} = ∂^mu A^nu - ∂^nu A^mu. Each A^mu has dimension 1, so each derivative (which is dimension 1) brings ∂A to dimension 2. So F has dimension 2.

Now, the sigma tensor σ_{mu nu} is made from the gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{mu nu} is a product of two gamma matrices, but since it's an antisymmetric combination, it's effectively a dimensionless object.

So putting it all together: L_int is the product of κ, ψ̄, sigma, ψ, and F. Let's compute the dimensions.

ψ̄ has [3/2], sigma is [0], ψ is [3/2], F is [2]. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F would be (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) * 2 = 9/2? Wait, wait, no, because each part is multiplied. Wait, no: ψ̄ is 3/2, sigma is 0, ψ is 3/2, F is 2. So the product of these is (3/2) * (3/2) * 2 = (9/4) *2 = 9/2. And then we have κ multiplied by this. So the whole term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F must have dimension 4, since it's part of the Lagrangian density.

So the dimension of the term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] + (3/2 + 3/2 + 0 + 2) = [κ] + (3 + 2) = [κ] +5. So this must equal 4.

Wait, wait, no, let me recheck. Wait, the term is κ * ψ
