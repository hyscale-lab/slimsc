Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I remember about SMEFT? SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. So the operators must respect the same symmetries as the Standard Model itself.

Wait, but what are the symmetries of the Standard Model? The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which includes things like rotations and boosts. It also has gauge symmetries, like SU(2) and U(1), but this question isn't about those. Then there's the Poincaré symmetry, which includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, Poincaré is a bigger symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. So if the theory respects Poincaré, it must respect Lorentz as well. But I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it respect Poincaré?

Wait a second, I might be getting confused. The Standard Model is a Poincaré-invariant theory because it respects both Lorentz and translation symmetries. SMEFT is an effective theory that preserves the same symmetries as the Standard Model, right? So SMEFT operators must be
