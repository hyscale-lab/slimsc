Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step. Let me try to visualize each part of the process and see where it leads.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me sketch that structure. So, cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's -CH2OH), and at position 5, a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2) or something? Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, the structure is CH2=C(CH2?) Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(=CH2)- something? No, wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2-C(CH2)-. Wait, maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, maybe that's isopropenyl. Wait, let me think. Prop-1-en-2-yl group is CH2-CH(CH2)- but the double
