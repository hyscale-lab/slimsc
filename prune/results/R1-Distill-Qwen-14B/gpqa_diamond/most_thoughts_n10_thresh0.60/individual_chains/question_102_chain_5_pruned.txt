Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this pretty complex biology question. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their role in development. The setup involves some genetic constructs and imaging results in mice. So, the main issue is that after creating these mice and crossing them with SOX10-Cre mice, there's no green signal observed under the confocal microscope. The green signal is supposed to come from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So, why isn't the eGFP showing up?

First, let me understand the construct. It's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions in one vector. So, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry, allowing for the translation of a second ORF in a bicistronic mRNA.

Looking at the stops: Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. I remember that loxP sites are recognition sites for Cre recombinase. So, in the absence of Cre, these stop cassettes prevent expression of the downstream genes. But when Cre is present, it recombines the loxP sites, removing the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes to be expressed.

The vector is designed so that when Cre is expressed, both the ligand and receptor will be co-expressed. Because the Cre is under the control of SOX10 in the mice, which is a transcription factor active in neural crest cells. So, when the Cre is expressed, it should remove the stops, leading to expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

But the experiment shows no green signal. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that explain lack of eGFP? If the receptor is expressed, then eGFP should be visible. Unless the ligand is acting on the same cell, but I don't think this option directly relates to expression. So maybe not.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. The eGFP would be on the receptor, which is a transmembrane protein. If it's stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't reach the cell surface, so fluorescence wouldn't be detected. But why wouldn't it be expressed in the first place? The Western blot was done on total proteins, which would include all cellular proteins, including those stuck in the Golgi. So if the receptor isn't expressed, the Western would show no band. But if the construct is correctly expressed, the Western would pick it up regardless of its location. The question says the total proteins give a signal proportional to actin loading, implying that the loading is correct. So maybe the proteins are expressed but not in the right place? But without knowing about the Western blot results for the eGFP, it's hard to say. However, the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression on Western blot after transfection. So the issue isn't expression, but rather, perhaps, in the mice model.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Both are under CBA and IRES, which are strong promoters. So enhancers might not be the issue. Unless the construct is missing the regulatory elements. But the question says the ligand is under CBA, so it should be expressed when Cre is active. Wait, no, wait—the CBA is upstream of the ligand, which is in the bicistronic vector. I think the CBA promoter drives the ligand's expression, and the IRES allows for the receptor's expression. So maybe the problem is that the enhancer is missing, so the promoter isn't active. But why would that cause no eGFP? If the promoter isn't active, both ligand and receptor wouldn't be expressed. But the mice are homozygous for the construct—so the promoter should be functional. Hmm.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, the question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. If the fusion is done correctly, the eGFP should be appended to the receptor. But if the vectors weren't cloned correctly, perhaps the stop codon is in the wrong place, or the ORF is interrupted. Wait, the ligand ORF has a stop in a loxP cassette. Similarly for the receptor. So when Cre is active, the stops are removed, but if the ORFs are not correctly in frame, maybe the eGFP isn't being expressed. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is inserted in the wrong frame, leading to a premature stop codon or a nonfunctional protein. So when Cre is active, the stop is removed, but if the eGFP is out of frame, the receptor might not be expressed correctly. Or perhaps the ORF is disrupted, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the question says the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells. So the construct should work when Cre is active. But in the experiment, the
