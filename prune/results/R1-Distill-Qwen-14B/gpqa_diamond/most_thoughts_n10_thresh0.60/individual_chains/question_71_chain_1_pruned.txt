Okay, so I have this astronomy question in front of me. Let me read it carefully. It's about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variation. But the question is about their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. 

The setup says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so each planet's period is a multiple of the first one. Let me think: the periods are P1, P2=2P1, P3=2.5P1, P4=3.5P1, P5=5P1. Right, that's the ratio given.

The question asks about the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so that factor won't affect the ratio. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature relates to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's semi-major axis. But wait, another version I recall is T proportional to (L/(16πσ a²))^(1/4), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the inverse square law since their albedo is same, so the temperature depends on the distance from the star.

Wait, but the orbital periods are given. I know that Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So, P² ∝ a³. Therefore,
