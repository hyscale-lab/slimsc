Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me read through it again.

The question is about a chemist performing two reactions using mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The starting alkenes are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both reactions go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The options are about how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. So, the first step in both reactions is epoxidation.

Wait, but then what happens after that? Oh right, when epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, they undergo ring-opening reactions. The conditions (acid and water) likely lead to acid-catalyzed ring opening. The mechanism for that typically involves the epoxide oxygen being protonated, which makes the leaving group better. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. In an acidic aqueous solution, I think water is the nucleophile.

So for each reaction, we have an epoxide, which upon treatment with acid, opens to form a diol. But wait, the configuration of the starting alkene (E vs Z) must affect the structure of the epoxide and thus the diol.

Wait, let me think. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) oct-4-enes. So, both are symmetric in a way because oct-4-ene is a four-carbon double bond in the middle. But the E and Z isomer would affect the epoxide geometry.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen is added across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For a trans (E) starting alkene, the epoxide would form with a certain stereochemistry, and similarly for the cis (Z) isomer.

Wait, no, I think mCPBA is an electrophilic oxidizing agent. It adds across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to the formation of an epoxide. The addition is such that the peracid's oxygen adds to the less substituted carbon, but wait, in the case of symmetrical alkenes like oct-4-ene, the substitution is the same on both ends.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2 at positions 4 and 5, with CH2 groups on either side. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Maybe I should draw it out.

But wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 at positions 4 and 5, so it's CH
