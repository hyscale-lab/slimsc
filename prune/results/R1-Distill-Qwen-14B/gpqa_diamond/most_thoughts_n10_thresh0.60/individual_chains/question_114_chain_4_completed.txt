Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN using reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (along with H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different pairs for A and B.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember some reactions involving ketones and nitriles. 

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN in the presence of a reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanone is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH3. Adding CN here... Oh wait, maybe this is a nucleophilic addition. Ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles like CN-.

But wait, isn't the typical reaction of ketones with HCN followed by acid workup giving a cyanohydrin? So when a ketone like R2CO reacts with CN-, under acidic conditions, it forms R2C(OH)CN. Oh right, that's the cyanohydrin formation. So in the first step, butan-2-one (R2CO where R is CH3) reacts with NaCN and an acid catalyst (H+), which would be H3O+ perhaps, to form the cyanohydrin. So reagent A must be H3O+ as the acid. Because NaCN is a source of CN-.

Wait, but could it be something else? Like, maybe if it's a different catalyst, but I think for cyanohydrin formation, acid is used. So Reagent A is H3O+. So looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3 as A. Hmm.

So for the first part, A is H3O+.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. So, how do you convert nitriles to carboxylic acids?

One common method is hydrolysis. Under acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, but with certain reagents. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl for the hydrolysis might be involved. Wait, but what's the typical reagent for this?

I recall that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For acid-catalyzed hydrolysis, you typically use H3O+ (like H2SO4 and heat) followed by neutralization. But in some cases, other acids might be used. Alternatively, in the presence of H2O and another acid catalyst.

Wait, the second reaction uses reagent B and H2O. So the nitrile is going to a carboxylic acid. So what conditions would facilitate that?

Wait, nitrile to carboxylic acid: the hydrolysis requires strong acidic or basic conditions. But in the presence of H2O. So if reagent B is an acid, like HCl, that would make sense. Because to get a carboxylic acid from a nitrile, the typical conditions are either HCl under reflux or using H2O and an acid catalyst.

Wait, but wait, the product is a hydroxybutanoic acid. Oh wait, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group. So the nitrile is at position 2, the same as the hydroxyl group. So the structure is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is OHC(C)(OH)... Wait, no, the structure is more like CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-something. 

But regardless, the reaction is nitrile to carboxylic acid. So the reagent B would need to be an acid catalyst. So for the second step, reagent B must be HCl or something else like H2SO4. But looking at the options, the choices for B are HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). 

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid. Would that be sufficient for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I think the nitrile hydrolysis typically requires more vigorous conditions. Like, for example, using HCl and heat. Or perhaps H2SO4 and water.

Wait, but the problem states that the second reaction uses reagent B and H2O. So, the nitrile is being hydrolyzed in aqueous conditions. So, using HCl (HCl in H2O) would be a strong acid condition, which would protonate the nitrile, aiding in the hydrolysis.

So, for the first part, reagent A is H3O+ (so options A or B). For the second part, B is HCl, which would be option A or C.

Looking back, options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH.

Wait, but the second reaction, for the hydrolysis, is it HCl or another strong acid?

Alternatively, if the nitrile is in a molecule that's somewhat hindered, maybe a milder acid would work. But I think HCl is a common reagent for this. So B would be HCl, so in the options, A and C have B as HCl. But for the first part, A is H3O+ only in options A and B, so C and D have A as NaHSO3. So if the first part requires H3O+, then the correct option would be A, where A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but wait another thought: in the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN under acidic conditions gives the cyanohydrin. So yes, H3O+ for A.

So the correct option would be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl. So option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Are there any other possibilities? For the second reaction, is there a possibility of using something else?

Wait, another way to make a carboxylic acid from a nitrile is via the hydrolysis using a strong acid like H2SO4 or HCl. So option A would have B as HCl, which makes sense.

Alternatively, sometimes NaOH is used in basic conditions, but that would give a carboxylate, which would then need to be acidified. But in this problem, the reagent is B plus H2O, so perhaps it's a two-step process where B is an acid.

So I think the correct answer is option A: A is H3O+, B is HCl.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (CH3-CO-CH2-CH3) with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the ketone reacts with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. For this reaction, an acid catalyst is typically required, and H3O+ is a suitable choice. Therefore, reagent A is identified as H3O+.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. Under acidic conditions, nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, and HCl is a common reagent for this purpose. Thus, reagent B is identified as HCl.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H3O+, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH. While A is correct, CH3COOH (a weak acid) is less suitable for the hydrolysis of nitriles.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl. NaHSO3 is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H3O+ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
