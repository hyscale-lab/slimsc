Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question says that the FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around 3000 often indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The peak at 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700. So maybe the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the NMR data: the 1H NMR shows several peaks, none of which are vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent Hs, like in alkenes. That means the structure doesn't have any vinyl groups, which fits with all the options since they're all some sort of branched carboxylic acids.

Now, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but it suggests some coupling with multiple neighboring protons. Let me think about how that could happen.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, structure-wise, that's something like (CH3)(C2H5)C-CH2COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central carbons each have a CH group attached to two ethyl groups. So each of those CHs would have two neighboring groups. Let me draw this structure.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the central CHs are attached to an ethyl and a C2H5 group. Wait, same as A? Or maybe different substitution. Let me see: the structure is CH2CH2-... Wait, no, the first part is CH3CH2, so it's (CH2CH3) attached to a CH group which is attached to a C2H5 (another ethyl). So two CH groups, each with one ethyl and another substituent. Not sure.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, the central CHs each have a methyl group. So each is CH(CH3), and there are two of them. So each of these CHs would be next to two methyl groups.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So it's CH2CH3 attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH3. Then another CH with CH3 and then COOH. So the substituents are one ethyl and two methyl groups on the central CHs.

Wait, but looking at the NMR splitting: each of the CH groups in the structure would have neighboring groups. Let's think about each option's structure.

For each option, the central CH groups are attached to different substituents. The NMR splitting comes from the number of neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons.

Let me think about each option:

Option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So each CH is connected to a CH3 and a CH2CH3 group. The CH groups are adjacent to each other, so each has two neighboring groups. Let's see the possible coupling. Each CH has two CH3 groups on either side? Wait, no, the two CHs are next to each other. So each CH is attached to two CH3 groups (from their own substituent) and the adjacent CH.

Wait, maybe it's better to
