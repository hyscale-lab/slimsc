Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Let me see if I can figure this out. Hmm, the question says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. I remember from my studies that when a particle is at rest and decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? Or wait, neutrinos are considered to have negligible mass in these kinds of problems, so I can probably treat them as massless.

So the Pi(+) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so maybe it's zero for this calculation. 

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So after the decay, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to sum to zero. That means the neutrino has some momentum, and the muon has an equal and opposite momentum.

Energy-wise, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. 

Wait, but when a particle decays, the rest energy is converted into the rest mass energies of the decay products plus their kinetic energies. So the total energy after decay must equal the initial energy. 

Let me formalize this. The initial energy is E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the energies are E_mu and E_nu. E_mu is the total energy of the muon, which is its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy. Similarly, E_nu is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Oh wait, no, wait. E_mu squared is (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2. So E_mu = sqrt( (p
