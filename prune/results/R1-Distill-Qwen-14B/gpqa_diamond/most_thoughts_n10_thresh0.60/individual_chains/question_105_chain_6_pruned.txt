Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the solution. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface is covered with dark spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, the spots come into view and cause brightness variations that we observe. The interesting part is that this can look similar to an exoplanet passing in front of the star, blocking some light and causing a dip in brightness. The question is asking, if there were no spots, what would be the radius of a planet that would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as these spots do?

Hmm. So the problem is essentially comparing the effect of a planet transit to the effect of these starspots. Both cause dips in the star's brightness, but for different reasons. The planet blocks some light, while the spots make the star appear dimmer in certain regions.

Wait, but in the case of the planet, the dip is because the planet is blocking a part of the star's bright surface. The spots are cooler regions, so when they're facing us, they contribute less light than the rest of the star. So, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is a combination of the spots being cooler and their position changing as the star rotates.

But the question says to assume the star isn't covered by spots. So we're to find the planet radius that would cause the same amplitude. That is, the depth of the dip in brightness (the change in flux) should be the same.

Let me think about the two scenarios:

1. Starspots: One hemisphere (so 50% of the surface) is covered with spots, each spot has a 20% filling factor. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait no, wait. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, that's 0.2 of the hemisphere's area.
