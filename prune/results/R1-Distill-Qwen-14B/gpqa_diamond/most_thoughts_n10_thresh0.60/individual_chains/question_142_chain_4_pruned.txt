Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubits space.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

Wait, qubits can be represented in a two-dimensional Hilbert space. The state of a qubit can be written as |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, but density matrices are more general since they can describe mixed states as well as pure states.

I'm trying to remember how density matrices look. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the density matrix is |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, the given ρ isn't written as a single outer product; it's a sum of two outer products. Let me compute what ρ actually is.

Breaking it down: ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). So each term is a projector. Adding them together and scaling by 1/2 gives a matrix. Let me write this out in terms of the basis states.

In matrix form, |0⟩ is [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with 1s in the first position and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 1 in the second position. So when I add them, it's:

|0⟩⟨0| = [[1,0],[0,0]]
|1⟩⟨1| = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2, ρ becomes (1/2) * I.

Wait, that's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. Because it's a completely mixed state, it doesn't have any coherence and is equally likely to be in state |0⟩ or |1⟩.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I think this refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector (r) for a density matrix is calculated based on the expectation values. For a general density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector components are (ρ_{01} + ρ_{10})/(2), (ρ_{01} - ρ_{10})/(2i), and (ρ_{00} - 1)/2. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the off-diagonal elements and the diagonal.

Wait, more accurately, the Bloch sphere representation comes from the expectation values. The density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the
