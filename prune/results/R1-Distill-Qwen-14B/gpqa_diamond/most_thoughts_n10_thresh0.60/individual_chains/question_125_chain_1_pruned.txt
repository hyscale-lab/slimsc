Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential, which means the force is Hooke's law, F = -kx, but in 3D and radial terms.

The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. So I need to remember how the energy levels and eigenfunctions work for a 3D harmonic oscillator.

Wait, in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. I think each direction (x, y, z) has a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers. The total energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ). Oh wait, no, wait, actually the formula is E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ), right. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, and adding all three gives that sum.

But wait, sometimes the energy is expressed in terms of the total quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = ħω (n + 3/2 ), right. So n is the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

Now, the third excited state. Hmm, I need to clarify what the ground state and excited states are. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n = 0. So n=0: E = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when n=1, which has E = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is n=2, E= (7/2) ħω. Third excited state is n=3, E= (9/2) ħω. So the energy is (9/2) ħω. Looking at the options, let's see. Option A is (9/2) ħω, and option C is the same. So that's the energy part.

Now the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for this energy eigenvalue. That is, the degeneracy of the state. The degeneracy comes from the number of ways to get n=3 as the sum of n_x, n_y, and n_z, where each is a non-negative integer.

Wait, wait. So the number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) that add up to n. For n=3, we need the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z =3.

This is a combinatorics problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation a + b + c = n is (n + 3 -1 choose 3-1 )= (n+2 choose 2). So for n=3, it's (3+2 choose 2) = 5 choose 2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10, meaning 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions.
