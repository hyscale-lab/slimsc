Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, right, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I remember that it's something to do with the uncertainty in position and momentum being related. The question gives me the uncertainty in the electron's position and its speed, and I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy. 

Wait, let me read the question again. The electron is moving along the x-direction at v=2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in position Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, electrons are really small, so quantum effects are definitely in play here.

So, the Uncertainty Principle states that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Here, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes people use h/(2π) for ħ, but I think the exact value might not matter here since we're looking for an order of magnitude estimate.

But wait, the question is about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh right, because energy and momentum are related for particles, especially when considering relativistic speeds, but wait, is the speed given high enough for relativistic effects? Let me see: 2e8 m/s is 2/3 the speed of light (since c is about
