Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I guess those are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The question is asking me to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the elements Aij are hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. So let me unpack that.

Wait, the operator's matrix is such that all the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So if it's a 2x2 matrix, since we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, the matrix would look like:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Hmm, that matrix reminds me of the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are usually represented with σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yeah, this operator is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me make sure. The operator A has A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that's exactly as I wrote before. So the operator is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], which is indeed (hbar/2) times σ_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of σ_x. Because if I multiply σ_x by a scalar, the eigenstates don't change; only the eigenvalues do. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x.

What are the eigenstates of σ_x? Well, they are the superpositions |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Wait, no, actually, let's think again. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1. But since our operator is (hbar/2) times σ_x, the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> as I mentioned. So when the problem says we need to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, that is, find the probability of the system being in |+
