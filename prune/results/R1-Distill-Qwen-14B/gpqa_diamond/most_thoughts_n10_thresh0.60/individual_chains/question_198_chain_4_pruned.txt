Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that there's a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that stability constants (β) are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex is. So, each β corresponds to a different complex. The complexes are probably Co(SCN)_n^m+ where n is 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

Wait, the question mentions dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So, the blue complex is likely the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ ion. But wait, wait, wait. Which one is the blue one? I think the different Co(SCN)_n complexes have different colors. Co(SCN)_4^3- is usually the blue one, but wait, that's for Co^3+. Oh wait, the problem is about Co(II), so maybe the complexes are different.

Wait, no. Let me think. For Co^2+, the thiocyanate complexes can form different species. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is a common complex and is blue. But wait, let me make sure. I'll try to remember: Co^2+ with thiocyanate can form [Co(SCN)_4]^3- which is blue. So that would be the dithiocyanato? Wait, that's four SCN- ligands. Oh wait, wait, wait. The problem says "blue dithiocyanato", which is two SCN-? No, wait, "dithiocyanato" would be two SCN ligands, but the blue complex is
