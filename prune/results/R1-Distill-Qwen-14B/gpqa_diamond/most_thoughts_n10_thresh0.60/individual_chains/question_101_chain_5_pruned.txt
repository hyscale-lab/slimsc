Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find the suitable reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

Wait, acid-catalyzed reaction... Oh right, maybe it's an alkylation or some kind of addition. Let me think about the structure of the product. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at the 1-position. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl, which I think is a cyclohexylidene group attached to a methyl group. Wait, cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexene ring connected via a double bond, right? So, maybe it's an allyl type structure.

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So the structure would be a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (CH₂) connected to the pyrrolidine. Wait, but cyclohexylidene is a group where there's a cyclohexane ring with a double bond to a carbon. So the substituent would be CH₂ connected to a cyclohexene ring? Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group with a double bond adjacent to the point of attachment? Like, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene attached through a methylene bridge.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexene ring connected via a CH₂ group. So the substituent is a methylene group (CH₂-) attached to a cyclohexene ring, making it a cyclohexylidene methylene group?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexylidene group attached to a methyl group. So, the substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected via a single bond to a methylene group, which itself is attached to pyrrolidine.

Wait, perhaps the product is an enamine. Because pyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, and forming an enamine typically involves a ketone or aldehyde reacting with a secondary amine in the presence of an acid catalyst.

Wait, that rings a bell. En
