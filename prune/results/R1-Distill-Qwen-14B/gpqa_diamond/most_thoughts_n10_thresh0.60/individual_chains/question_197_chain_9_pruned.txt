Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about identifying a final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI is a reagent for the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, specifically for adding HI in a way that follows anti-Markovnikov addition. Wait, no, waitâ€”red phosphorus is used in the hydroxylation reaction? Or is it for something else. Oh right, when you have an alkene and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's called the hydroxyiodination reaction. Or wait, maybe it's the oxymercuration or something else. No, no, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me get this straight. Oh wait, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI is actually for the anti-Markovnikov addition of HI to alkenes. Red phosphorus is a catalyst in the addition of HX to alkenes, I think. But wait, when you have excess HI and red phosphorus, it might be for the formation of i-ions, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition.

But wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI could also be conditions for the Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig is with triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. So probably, this is about addition of HI to an alkene.

So the first step is to figure out what Compound X is. Because once I know that, I can predict the product after reaction with
