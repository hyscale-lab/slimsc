Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch. Either an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid? But wait, looking at the other peaks, there's a 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 2500-3000 and a strong C=O around 1700. So maybe compound X is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but what about the 1610 and 1450 cm-1? Those could be aromatic ring vibrations. So if it's a carboxylic acid with an aromatic ring, that makes sense. So X is likely a benzoic acid derivative.

Now looking at the NMR data. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's probably the -COOH proton, which is usually around 10-12 ppm. Then, the aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the doublets are each 2H, which would be typical for two sets of equivalent protons in a para arrangement. Like if there's a substituent in the para position, then the two adjacent H's would be a doublet each.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet which might suggest a CH group adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl or an electronegative atom. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group near another CH or something. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a singlet for a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH or an oxygen. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, likely in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together: The aromatic protons are para-substituted, so let's say the substituent is at the para position. The substituent is probably a group with a carbonyl, since we have a 1720 cm-1. Wait, but the IR suggested a carboxylic acid, but also, another O-H? Wait, no, the 3400–2500 is probably the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. So X is benzene with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent in the para position.

Wait, but let's look again at the NMR. The 2.9 ppm multiplet – maybe that's the CH group in a propyl chain attached somewhere. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. Wait, but that would make sense if it's a propyl group attached to something. Like, maybe a -CH2CH2CH2- group, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a d, 3H, which is a methyl attached to a CH, like a -CH(CH3) group. So that would suggest a branching.

Wait, let me think about the possible substituent. If the aromatic ring has a -COOH group and another substituent, maybe the substituent is an isobutyl group or something. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH in a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, but then I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -(CH2)2CH3 group, but that's just an ethyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group. Because the 2.9 ppm would be the CH next to the ring. Then, the 1.4 ppm is the methyl attached to the CH. Wait, but that would give a d, 3H. So in that case, the structure would be:

The benzene ring with a -COOH group and a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group in the para position? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3) group.

Wait, but let's think about the integration. The 2.9 is 1H, so that's probably a CH group connected to something. The
