Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution.

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? So I need to calculate [PO4^3-]. But wait, phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, that suggests we're dealing with a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. Its dissociation steps are:
1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, in solution, the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- because the buffer is made from those two. Wait, but the question is about PO4^3-, which is from the third dissociation. But at pH levels around where these salts are, is PO4^3- significant? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, so KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. It dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water, but I think the water doesn't affect the ions much here.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions
