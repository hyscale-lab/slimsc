Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm. Let me try to break it down. So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it step by step.

First, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, dark spots on the star would make it cooler, right? Because spots are presumably areas with lower temperature than the surrounding photosphere.

The key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å. Oh, and LTE is assumed, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

I remember that the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and g's are the statistical weights (degeneracy numbers) for each level.

Wait, but if the ratio n1/n2 is what's observed, then it would be the inverse. Let me make sure. The problem states the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. That means when the star is spotted, the ratio is smaller. So the ratio (n1/n2) goes down.

Wait, no, wait. Let me read that again. The ratio of the number of neutral atoms in level 1
