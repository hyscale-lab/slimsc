Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reaction steps. 

First, I need to understand the structure we're aiming for. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking it down, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, the ethanone (acetophenone) group is attached at position 1, which I think would be the ortho position relative to the nitro group.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the numbering right. The substituents are at 3 and 5. So the benzene ring has three substituents: a bromine, a nitro group, and an acetyl group (from ethan-1-one). So where are they placed?

The numbering should have the substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 if all three are present. Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethan-1-one, which is a ketone, so the structure is benzalacetophenone? Or wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So the benzene ring is attached to a ketone group (CH3-C(O)-) at position 1. Then, the substituents on the benzene ring are at positions 3 and 5: bromo and nitro.

So the benzene is meta-substituted for the bromo and nitro groups, and the acetyl is in the para position relative to one of them? Or perhaps the acetyl is in the para position relative to the bromine and meta relative to nitro, or vice versa.

Wait, the substituents are in positions 3 and 5 on the benzene ring, so positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other. Then, the acetyl group is attached at position 1, which would be the para position relative to position 5 and
