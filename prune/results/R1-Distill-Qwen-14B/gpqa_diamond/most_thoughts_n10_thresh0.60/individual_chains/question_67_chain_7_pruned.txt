Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about the angular momentum states of two electrons, so I'll need to think about quantum numbers and their properties.

The problem states: We have two electrons in p orbitals. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l equal to 1, since p orbitals have l=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that notation is a bit confusing. Let me parse it. So, |l₁, l₂, l, m⟩. So l₁ and l₂ are the individual orbital angular momenta of each electron. Since both are p orbitals, l₁ and l₂ are both 1. Then l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is 2 here. And m is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum, which is -1 in this case.

But wait, the question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ each. So each Lz component is for each electron. So, L₁z and L₂z are the individual z-components of the orbital angular momenta of electron 1 and electron 2, respectively.

So, ignoring spin angular momentum, which the question says to do, I'm only considering the orbital angular momentum. Each electron has Lz = mħ, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, for orbital angular momentum, the magnetic quantum number can be -
