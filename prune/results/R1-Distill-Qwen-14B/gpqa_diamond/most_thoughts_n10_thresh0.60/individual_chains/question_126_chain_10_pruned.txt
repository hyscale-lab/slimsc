Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think through each step.

The problem says that an organic chemist performed two reactions, I and II. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. I need to find out how many peaks there are in each.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. So, when LAH reduces it, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. But wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group. Oh, wait, no, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is (S) at the 5th carbon, which has a methoxy group.

So for Reaction I, the ketone at position 3 is reduced. So 5-methoxyhexan-3-one becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, wait, no. The structure of hexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon; wait, hexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the 5th carbon would be the second carbon from the end. Hmm, maybe it's better to draw the structure.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: 

The carbons are 1 to 6. Position 3 is the ketone. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH-OCH3 (because it's the 5th carbon, and it's methoxy)
Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no. For hexan-3-one, the carbonyl is at position 3, so the structure is CH2CH2 groups around the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps it's:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2
