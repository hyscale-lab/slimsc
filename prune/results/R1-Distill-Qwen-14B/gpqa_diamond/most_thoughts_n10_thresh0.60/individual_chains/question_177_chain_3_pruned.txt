Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So, both stars have the same peak wavelength. They also measured their radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. The options are A to D, all around 2.2 to 2.35. So the factor is somewhere in that ballpark.

First, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are radiating as black bodies, this should apply to both.

The question mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (their peak wavelengths) are the same. I think this relates to Wien's law, which says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, no—wait, if λ_max is the same, then T would be the same as well. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max is same, T is same. So both stars have the same temperature. Is that right?

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, then if both stars have the same λ_max, then T for both is the same. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

So if both have the same temperature, then their luminosities can be compared using their radii. Because L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both, L is proportional to R squared.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So the ratio of luminosities would be (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1/L2 = 2.25. That would be option A. But wait, the options don't have 2.25 as the correct answer. Because looking at the options, A is ~2.25, but the answer might not be that because there's more to it.

Wait, maybe I
