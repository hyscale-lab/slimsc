Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems usually involves considering the interactions between charges, including induced charges.

Wait, let me read the problem again. So, a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, so maybe I can find the correct formula by recalling some concepts.

I think when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the Earth and can have charges flow in or out. So, when charge q is near the sphere, it will induce charges on the sphere. If q is positive, the sphere's inner surface will have an induced negative charge, and the outer surface will have a positive charge because the sphere is grounded. Or wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, in a conducting sphere, the charges inside the conductor (the inner surface) will be induced. But because it's grounded, the excess charge can leave, so the induced charges on the inner surface must be opposite to q, and the outer surface would have any additional charges from the ground.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the method of images here. The method of images is used in electrostatics to solve problems with conductors. For a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the image charge approach says that the potential can be found by considering an image charge inside the sphere. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. But in this case, the charge q is placed, and the sphere is grounded. So perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring q from infinity to its position, plus the work done to assemble the induced charges on the sphere.

Alternatively, when a charge q is placed near a grounded sphere, the sphere's induced charges consist of a charge -q' on the inner surface and a charge +Q on the outer surface. But wait, since the sphere is grounded, the outer surface can have any charge, but the inner surface must have -q'. Wait, no, the induced charge on the inner surface is opposite to q. So if q is positive, the inner surface of the sphere has -q, and the outer surface must have whatever charge is
