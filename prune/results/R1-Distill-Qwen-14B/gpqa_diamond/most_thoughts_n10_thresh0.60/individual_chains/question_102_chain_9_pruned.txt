Okay, so I've got this question about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Hmm, let me break it down. 

The question describes a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. So, in this case, the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so that should drive the ligand expression. The receptor is upstream of an IRES element, which I think is a RNA internal ribosome entry site. IRES allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for a second promoter. So the receptor's expression would depend on the translation machinery reading through the IRES after the ligand's mRNA is translated. 

Now, looking at the stop cassettes. Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh right, the Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette. 

The setup is that they're using SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I believe. So when the Cre is active, it would recombine the lox sites. Let me think: in the ligand region, the stop is loxP, so Cre would remove it, allowing mCherry to be expressed along with the ligand. Similarly, the receptor's stop is lox2272, so Cre would delete that, allowing eGFP to be expressed with the receptor. 

But in the experiment, when the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, they don't see a green signal. So why isn't eGFP showing up? The green would be from the receptor-eGFP fusion. 

Possible options: 

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if both are expressed in the same cell, they might autostimulate. But the question is about expression, not function. So maybe not the issue here.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would prevent surface expression. But how's the construct designed? The receptor is a transmembrane protein. If the eGFP is at the C-terminus, which is intracellular, perhaps. Wait, eGFP is a reporter, so it might need to be on the surface. Or maybe it's intracellular. But if the construct is correctly processed, it should be expressed. Unless the stop cassette isn't properly removed. 

Wait, the issue might be with the stop cassettes and whether Cre is active in the right cells. Oh, but the mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes perhaps. So the Cre should be active there, excising the stop cassettes. 

Another thought: the vector is bicistronic, but the way the cassettes are set up. The ligand has a loxP stop, and the receptor has a lox2272 stop. Cre is loxP-specific, I think. Oh wait, lox2272 is a variant. So maybe if Cre can't recognize the lox sites, the stops aren't excised. But SOX10-Cre is typically loxP-specific. Or no, wait, some Cre variants can recognize lox2272? Or perhaps the construct is using different sites for each gene. So the ligand's stop is between ligand and mCherry, and the receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP. 

Wait, perhaps the problem
