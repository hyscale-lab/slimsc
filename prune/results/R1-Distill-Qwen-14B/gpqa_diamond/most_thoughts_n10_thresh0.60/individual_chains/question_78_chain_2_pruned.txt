Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time when a point charge q is moving. I remember potentials are related to the fields, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expressions, especially when the charge is moving.

Wait, the setup says the charge is moving with trajectory s(t), and r is the field point. Vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to where we're measuring the field. Oh right, because the fields propagate at the speed of light, the fields at t are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, where tr is such that t = tr + |d|/c, maybe? Or wait, the distance between the two points is d, but I'm not entirely sure about the time relationship.

The velocity at the field generating time tr is v. So the potentials V and A at time t depend on the charge's state at tr.

I recall that the scalar potential V due to a charge is usually something like kq/r, where k is 1/(4πε0). But when the charge is moving, does this change? Or does it still hold because the scalar potential is like the electrostatic potential, but maybe when considering motion, relativistic effects come into play? Or perhaps not, because potentials can be affected by the motion through the vector potential.

Wait, the problem is about potentials, not fields. So the scalar potential V is given by the static expression? Or does it involve the velocity somehow?

Wait, no, I think V is the electrostatic potential, which would be due to the charge being at a certain position. So V would be (q)/(4πε0 r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. But in this case, the distance between the charge at tr and the field point is d, right? So if d is the vector from the charge's position to r, then the distance is |d|.

Wait, but wait. The option C and D have expressions with (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Hmm, that looks like a term that could come from a Lorentz invariant expression
