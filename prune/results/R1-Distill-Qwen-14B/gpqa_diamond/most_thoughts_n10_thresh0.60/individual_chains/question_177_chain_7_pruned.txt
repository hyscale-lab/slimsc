Okay, I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Some details are given: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question says that assuming both stars radiate as black bodies, what's the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's? The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. I remember that luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T⁴. Oh wait, that's right. So if I can find the temperature ratio, I can find the luminosity ratio.

But wait, how do I find the temperatures of the stars? The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. I think that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. Oh right, Wien's law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, that would imply their temperatures are the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T is same. So T1 = T2.

Wait a second, but wait. Are the stars moving towards or away from us? Because their radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so it's not moving towards or away. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. But wait, would the Doppler effect affect the observed wavelengths? Oh, right! Because if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; moving away, redshifted. The observed wavelength is affected by this.
