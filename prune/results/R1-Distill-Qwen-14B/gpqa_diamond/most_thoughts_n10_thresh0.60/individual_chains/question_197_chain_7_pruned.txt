Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, that reaction sounds familiar. Oh right, red phosphorus and HI is usually used for the hydrolysis of an ester, maybe in a substitution reaction. Or wait, sometimes it's for the conversion of alky chlorides to alkanes via the Hoffman elimination, but I'm not too sure. Let me think.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the IR and NMR data.

The IR data has strong peaks. The peak around 3400-2500 cm-1 suggests the presence of an -OH group or possibly an alkyne. But I remember that alkyne C-H stretches are usually in that region. Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 peak is likely a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which might indicate aromatic rings (C=C stretching). So the compound probably has an aromatic ring, a carbonyl group, and maybe an -OH or alkyne.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's really high, so maybe an -OH proton. Wait, but could it be an aldehyde proton? Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm, but they're usually deshielded. But wait, if it's a broad peak, that might suggest an -OH, like in a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have broad -OH signals around 10-12 ppm. So maybe this is an -OH from a carboxylic acid group.

Then the next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. That suggests aromatic protons, probably para-substituted. Like in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent would be a doublet. So maybe something like para-methyl benzoic acid? Or another substituent.

The 7.2 ppm doublet, 2H. Wait, that
