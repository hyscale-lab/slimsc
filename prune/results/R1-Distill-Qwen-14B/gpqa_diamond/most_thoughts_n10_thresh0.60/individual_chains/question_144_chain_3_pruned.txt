Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see if I can figure this out. 

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, with some numbers in meters. 

Wait, mean decay distance? Oh right, that's related to how far the particle travels before decaying. I remember that particles with longer lifetimes travel further. But how do I calculate that?

I think the formula involves the lifetime of the particle. The mean decay length is the product of the velocity of the particle and its lifetime. Oh right, the formula should be L = βγcτ, where β is v/c, γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

So first, I need to find the proper lifetime τ. I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The relation is Γ = ħ/τ, but wait, actually, τ is ħ divided by Γ. Oh wait, no, because Γ is the total decay width, which is the inverse of the lifetime. So τ = ħ / Γ. But since ħ (h-bar) is in units of GeV·s, and Γ is in GeV, the units should work out to seconds.

Wait, let me get the units right. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So converting that, Γ = 0.32 GeV. 

So τ = ħ / Γ. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 /0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 s. Wait, no, wait. 6.5
