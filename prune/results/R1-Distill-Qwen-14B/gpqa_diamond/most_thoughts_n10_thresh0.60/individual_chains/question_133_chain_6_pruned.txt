Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and ion concentrations, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have a solution that's 200.00 cm³ (which I think is 200 mL) and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, and the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

The problem also gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So I remember that these are the dissociation constants for each step of the phosphoric acid losing protons.

Hmm, so I think this is a buffer solution problem since we have two different phosphate species. KH2PO4 is probably H2PO4^- (since K+ is the counterion), and Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when Na2HPO4 is in solution, it's HPO4^2- and Na+ ions. So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Orthophosphate ions are PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. So I need to find [PO4^3-] in this solution.

I think the solution involves understanding the equilibrium between HPO4^2- and PO4^3-.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. H3PO4 can lose three protons:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So the relevant equilibrium for PO4^3- is the third dissociation step. But in the solution, we have HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- because of the salts provided.

Wait, but wait—the solution contains both KH2PO4 (which gives H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4 (which gives HPO4^2-). So the system is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, right? Because that's the first and second dissociation steps. But the question is about PO4^3-, which comes from HPO4^2- losing another proton.

So, the PO4^3- concentration is determined by the third dissociation. So, to find [PO4^3-], I need to consider the third step:

HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

But wait, the solution is buffered at a certain pH because of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- present. So the pH will determine how much HPO4^2- dissociates into PO4^3-.

So first, I think I should calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution, then find the pH of the buffer, and then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- from the HPO4^2- dissociation.

Okay, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of each salt.
2. Determine the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
3. Find the pH of the buffer using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (for the second dissociation,
