Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says my colleague has a Feynman diagram with a "size estimate" written next to it. The expression is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. And I need to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this.

Wait, right. In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the process. Each loop typically contributes a factor that depends on the coupling constants and the number of dimensions, I think.

I remember that each loop brings in an integral over the loop momentum, which in four-dimensional spacetime (since the theory is on 4D spacetime) would involve factors of 1/(16 pi^2) each time because of the integration in loop integrals. Because four-dimensional integrals in loop calculations usually lead to terms like 1/(16 pi^2) raised to the number of loops. Oh wait, because each loop integral contributes a 1/(16 pi^2) factor when you renormalize or compute the amplitude.

Looking at the given expression: There's a 1/(4 pi)^6 term. Let me compute that: (4 pi)^6 is 4^6 pi^6. So 1/(4 pi)^6 is 1/(4^6 pi^6). But 4^2 is 16, so 4^6 is (4^2)^3 = 16^3 = 4096. So 1/(4 pi)^6 is 1/(4096 pi^6). Alternatively, I could write this as (1/(16 pi^2))^3 multiplied by (1/(4 pi^0)) ?? Not sure. Wait, 1/(4 pi)^6 is same as (1/(4 pi^2))^3, but wait, 4 pi is not 16 pi^2. Oh wait, wait. The integral for a loop in 4D typically gives a factor of 1/(16 pi^2). So if each loop contributes a 1/(16 pi^2), then for L loops, it's (1/(16 pi^2))^L. Let's see the given expression: 1/(4 pi)^6 =
