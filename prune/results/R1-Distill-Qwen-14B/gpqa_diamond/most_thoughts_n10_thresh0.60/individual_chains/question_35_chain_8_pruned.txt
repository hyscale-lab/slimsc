Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

First, the problem says that the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix given by c multiplied by S. The constant c is h over 4π, and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). My task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and then determine which of the given statements is correct.

Wait, so the operator is Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), that's a constant. So first, I should probably write out what the matrix Ay looks like.

The S matrix is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Multiplying by c, Ay becomes:
c*(0)   c*(-i)
c*(i)   c*(0)
Which is:
[ 0   -i*c ]
[ i*c  0 ]

Since c is h/(4π), substituting that gives:
[ 0   -i*(h/4π) ]
[ i*(h/4π) 0 ]

Wait, but maybe I can factor that out more. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues of S first and then scale by c.

Because if Ay = c * S, then the eigenvalues of Ay are just c times the eigenvalues of S. So perhaps I should first find the eigenvalues of S.

So, finding eigenvalues of the matrix S. The general approach is to compute the determinant of (S - λ I) and set it to zero.

The matrix S is:
[0   -i]
[i    0]

So, the characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0. Let's compute that.

The determinant of [ -λ   -i ]
                [ i    -λ ]

Which is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(i) = λ² - (i^2). Since i squared is -1, this becomes λ² - (-1) = λ² + 1 = 0.

So solving λ² = -1 → λ = ±i. Oh wait, so the eigenvalues of S are i and -
