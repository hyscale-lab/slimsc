Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term and some options for the possible decays. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

Alright, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f̄ ψf (y)(υ + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I think I might be misreading that. Oh wait, maybe it's more like L = -λ f (y) f̄ ψf (y) (υ + X(y)) ψf (y). Or perhaps it's written with ψ's. Wait, maybe it's a typo and the actual terms are fermion fields. Let me think. The interaction term usually involves the field X interacting with fermions. So perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction term.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions can X decay into at lowest order. At lowest order, the decay would typically be into a pair of fermions because higher-order processes might involve more particles or higher energies.

In particle physics, the mass of the decaying particle must be at least twice the mass of the fermions it's decaying into. So for X → f f̄, the mass of X must be ≥ 2 m_f. So the key here is figuring out which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV /2 =3 GeV).

So let me list the known fermion masses. Wait, but wait, the fermions are quarks and leptons. Let's think about their masses.

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2-5 MeV. So way below 3 GeV.
- Down (d): similar, about 3-6 MeV.
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV.
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV.
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV (but wait, that's about 4.5, so 4.5 GeV each, so 2 m_b would be 9 GeV.
