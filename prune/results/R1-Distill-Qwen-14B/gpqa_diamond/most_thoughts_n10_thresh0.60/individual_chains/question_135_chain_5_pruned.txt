Okay, so I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of the boson X. The problem gives me the Lagrangian and the mass of X as 6 GeV. Let me try to break this down.

First, looking at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, wait, perhaps it's written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f^\dagger (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Or maybe I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, it might be the interaction term. So, the interaction term between X and fermions would be something like X ψ^\dagger ψ, which suggests that the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair as long as the energy is sufficient. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So we're looking for all pairs where the combined mass of the fermion and antifermion is less than or equal to the mass of X, which is 6 GeV.

Wait, but since fermions are matter particles, their masses are much lower. Let me list the masses of all known fermions.

Quarks:
- Up (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Charm (c): about 1.3 GeV
- Strange (s): about 100 MeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
- Bottom (b): around 4.5 GeV

Leptons:
- Electron (e): 0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): 105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): 1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: almost massless, but since X is 6 GeV, and neutrinos are so light, but in any case, X can decay into neutrinos, but I don't think that's an option here. The options don't include neutrinos, so perhaps we can ignore them.

So, the fermion and antifermion pair's invariant mass must be less than or equal to X's mass. So, each fermion f must have a mass m such that 2m <= 6 GeV. Because each will have mass m, so together it's 2m.

So let's calculate 2m for each fermion:

u: 2*2.2 MeV = ~4.4 MeV << 6 GeV → allowed.
d: 2*4.7 MeV ≈ 9.4 MeV → allowed.
s: 2*100 MeV = 0.2 GeV → allowed.
c: 2*1.3 GeV = 2.6 GeV → allowed.
b: 2*4.5 GeV = 9 GeV → which is larger than 6 GeV. So not allowed.
t: way too heavy (173 GeV each, so 346 GeV, way above 6 GeV. So no.)
Leptons:
e: 2*0.511 MeV ≈ 1 MeV → allowed.
μ: 2*0.105 GeV ≈ 0.21 GeV → allowed.
τ: 2*1.78 GeV ≈ 3.56 GeV → allowed.

So the fermions that X can decay into are those with 2m <= 6 GeV. So u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait. Are the fermions in the Lagrangian all the possible ones? Because the Lagrangian is written as lambda f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) psi_f(y). Hmm, perhaps the notation is a bit unclear. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the interaction term is λ X
