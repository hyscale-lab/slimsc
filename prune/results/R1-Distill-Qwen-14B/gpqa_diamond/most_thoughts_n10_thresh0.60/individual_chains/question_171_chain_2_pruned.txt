Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrophilic substitution reactions. Let's take a deep breath and tackle this.

The question is about six different benzene derivatives undergoing an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. They're asking us to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm. Right, so each of these substituents will direct the incoming bromine either ortho, meta, or para, and they also have varying degrees of activating or deactivating effects.

Wait, but wait, the reaction is with excess bromine. Oh, right! In bromination, if there's excess Br2, the reaction is likely to go to completion, forming the most stable product. But wait, noâ€” wait, electrophilic substitution with bromine usually involves generating a bromine ion as the electrophile, right? Or wait, no, I think in the presence of FeBr3, it's more about the directing effect of the substituents.

Wait, maybe I should just focus on the substituents and their directing effects. Because the position of substitution (ortho, meta, para) depends on the substituent's nature.

So each substituent is attached to the benzene ring. Let me list them:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group (since it's an alkyl group). Activating groups make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But wait, methyl is ortho/para-directing.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Wait, is that a benzoyloxy group? So it's like O-CO-C6H5 attached to the benzene. Wait, no, wait, 2 is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, wait no, the structure is benzene ring with a COOEt group. So that's an ester group. Esters are meta-directing because the carbonyl is deactivating. Because the carbonyl oxygen is electron-withdrawing, so the ring is deactivating. So esters are meta directors. Oh wait, wait, no: wait, the substituent is COOEt. So the substituent is an ester group, which is ortho/para director? Wait, no, wait. Wait
