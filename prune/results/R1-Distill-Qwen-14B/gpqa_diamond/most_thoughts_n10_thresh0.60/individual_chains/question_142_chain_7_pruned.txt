Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, right? They're like statistical mixtures of pure states. So this ρ is a mixed state because it's a probabilistic combination of |0> and |1>.

I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, a qubit can be visualized as a point on a unit sphere in 3D space. The pure states |0> and |1> correspond to the north and south poles of the Bloch sphere. So |0> would be (0,0,1) and |1> would be (0,0,-1). Wait, but in this problem, the options are in terms of r coordinates, so maybe the Bloch vector is involved here.

The given density matrix is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability because of the 1/2 coefficient. So ρ = ½ |0><0| + ½ |1><1|. This looks like a completely mixed state because it's equally likely to be in either state. I think the completely mixed state in a single qubit is represented by the maximally mixed state, which in the Bloch sphere has all the Bloch vector's components zero. Oh right, because the density matrix for the maximally mixed state is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix.

Wait, let me write out the density matrix ρ. The |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 at (2,2). Adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. Oh wait, no, wait—each term is multiplied by ½, so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], multiplied by ½ gives [[0.5, 0], [0, 0]]. Similarly, |1><1|
