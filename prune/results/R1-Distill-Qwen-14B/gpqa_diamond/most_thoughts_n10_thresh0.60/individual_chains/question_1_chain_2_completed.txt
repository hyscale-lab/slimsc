Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2.

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 (let's call it ΔE = |E2 - E1|) needs to be larger than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps, to be distinguishable, the energy difference must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties? Or the sum?

I think the correct approach is that the energy resolution (the minimum detectable energy difference) is determined by the uncertainty principle. So the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy, which is the maximum of the individual uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is larger than each individual uncertainty, then each state's energy is sufficiently distinct.

Wait, wait, perhaps another approach. The energy difference ΔE must be such that the natural linewidths (the uncertainties) of the two states are smaller than ΔE. So the uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2 as calculated above. So ΔE must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if ΔE is bigger than each of their uncertainties, then the two energy levels can be resolved.

Looking back at the numbers: ΔE1 is about 6.56e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.56e-8 eV. So the larger uncertainty is 6.56e-7 eV. So the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than 6.56e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV → less than 6.56e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way smaller, so no.

C) 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is 1e-4. That's way bigger than 6.56e-7. So yes, that would work.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8. Compared to 6.56e-7 eV, this is smaller. So no.

So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is much larger than the maximum uncertainty of about 6.56e-7 eV. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the energy difference that allows the two quantum states to be clearly distinguished, we apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2. Here, the lifetimes of the two states, τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s and τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s, serve as the time uncertainties (Δt₁ and Δt₂). 

The uncertainty in energy for each state is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\hbar}{\tau}
\]

Using the reduced Planck's constant \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), we find:

- For τ₁ = 10⁻⁹ s:
  \[
  \Delta E₁ = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to eV (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E₁ \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-25}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
  \]

- For τ₂ = 10⁻⁸ s:
  \[
  \Delta E₂ = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-8}} \approx 1.05 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
  \]
  Converting to eV:
  \[
  \Delta E₂ \approx \frac{1.05 \times 10^{-26}}{1.602176634 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
  \]

To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = |E₂ - E₁| \) must be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, which is \( \Delta E₁ \approx 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \).

Now, we compare the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.001 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is much smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is smaller than \( 6.56 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

Thus, the energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to clearly resolve the two energy levels.
