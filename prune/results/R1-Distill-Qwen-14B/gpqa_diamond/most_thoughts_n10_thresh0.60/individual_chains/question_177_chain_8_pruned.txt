Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. 

The question is about the luminosity ratio between Star_1 and Star_2. They computed that Star_1's luminosity is greater by a certain factor, and we have to choose which option is correct among A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Wait, so the problem says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. Right, so the black body radiation law applies here. The luminosity of a star is related to its radius, temperature, and other factors. I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the luminosity L is proportional to R² T⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. Oh yes, the formula is L = 4πσ R² T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the first step is to find the luminosity ratio L1/L2. Since L is proportional to R² T⁴, the ratio would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴).

Given that R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1 = 1.5 R2. That part is straightforward.

Now, the next part is about the temperatures. The problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898 × 10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures should be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. Wait, but wait a minute—does this apply even if the stars are moving with radial velocities?

Wait, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so it's not moving towards or away from us. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Hmm, does this affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right! Because of the Doppler effect. The star's velocity affects the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength for Star_2 might be different, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they are the same. So perhaps the observed λ_max is the same for both. But the actual λ_max of each star (before considering Doppler shift) could be different because of their velocities. Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, the light we receive is Doppler shifted.

So for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, I think that velocity is away from us because the radial velocity is positive (assuming it's moving away). Wait, but the sign depends on convention. Oh, right, the radial velocity is positive if moving away, negative if moving towards. So Star_2 is moving away from us at 700 km/s.

So the observed wavelength λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Wait, no, wait: the Doppler shift formula for wavelengths is λ = λ0 (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, if the star is moving away, v_r is positive, so λ increases (redshift). If moving towards, v_r is negative, so λ decreases (blueshift).

But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths at which they peak are the same. So, for Star_1, the observed λ_max is λ1 = λ1_rest, because Star_1's velocity is 0. For Star_2, the observed λ_max is λ2_observed = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r / c). But according to the problem, λ1 = λ2_observed. So:

λ1_rest = λ2_rest * (1 + v_r2 / c)

But from Wien's Law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So λ1_rest = b / T1, and λ2_rest = b / T2.

So substituting, (b/T
