Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Lagrangian and renormalizability. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I'm supposed to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, right, renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. I remember that in four-dimensional spacetime, each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4, because the action is dimensionless.

So each term in the Lagrangian has to have [L] = 4. So I'll need to find the dimensions of each part of L_int.

Breaking down the term: κ is the coupling, and the rest is ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Let me think about each field's dimensions. For a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is [ψ] = 3/2. Because in 4D, the action has dimension 0, and the integral is d^4x (dim 4), so the Lagrangian density has [L] = 4, so each term in it has [L] =4. So for the Dirac term iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each ψ is 3/2, ∂_μ has dimension 1, so putting it together: (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 5? Wait, that can't be right because the term must be dimension 4. Oh wait, no, that term is part of the Dirac Lagrangian, which has [L] =4. So perhaps I got that wrong.

Wait, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So for the Dirac term, iψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ: let's compute dimensions. ψ has dimension 3/2 each. So ψ̄ ψ is 3. Then ∂_μ is dimension 1. So the term becomes 3 + 1 =4. Oh, right. So each ψ has dimension 3/2.

So back to our L_int term. Let's compute the dimension of each component.

First, the term is κ * ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is dimension 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is (3/2) * 2 =3.

What about σ_{μν}? It's a product of γ matrices, which are dimensionless, and the structure is [γ_mu, γ_nu], so σ is dimensionless as well.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is made from ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 2, because each derivative is dimension 1, and two of them? Wait, no. Let me think.
