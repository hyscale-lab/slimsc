Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to it, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength from their blackbody radiation, I think. Also, their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. 

The question is about the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2. They assume both radiate as black bodies, so I'll need to use the blackbody formulas here.

First, I remember that the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L depends on the radius squared and the temperature to the fourth power.

But wait, the peak wavelength is the same for both stars. Oh, right, Wien's law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both, that implies their temperatures are the same too. Because if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. So T is the same for both stars.

Wait, but wait a second. Radial velocities are given. How does that come into play? Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the star moving towards us (or away) would have its spectrum shifted. But the peak wavelength they measure is the observed one, right?

So, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted peak. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So does this affect the measured temperature? Because from our perspective, the wavelengths are Doppler shifted.

Hmm, okay, so let me think. Suppose Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s. The Doppler effect would cause its emitted wavelengths to shift to shorter wavelengths (blue shift). So the observed λ_max would be lower than the actual emitted λ_max. But in the problem, they found that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_1's λ_max is as emitted, but Star_2's is Doppler shifted. So the actual emitted λ_max of Star_2 is longer than what we observe.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the Doppler shift right. The formula for Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), assuming v is towards the observer. Or is it (1 + v/c) in the numerator? Let me think. When a star moves towards us, the wavelength is blueshifted, so λ_obs is less than λ_emit. So the formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ) ), I think. Because when v is positive (towards observer), the denominator is larger, so the ratio is less than 1, so λ_obs is smaller.

Wait, actually, I think the Doppler shift formula for wavelength can be approximated as λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c) when v is much smaller than c, which it is here (since 700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light, so non-relativistic). So to a first approximation, λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 - v/c).

But in this problem, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. But Star_1 has velocity 0, so λ_emit1 = λ_obs1. Star_2 has velocity 700 km/s towards us, so its emitted wavelength is longer. Because λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 - v/c). Since λ_obs2 equals λ_obs1 (same as λ_emit1), we can write:

λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 - v/c) 

But I'm not sure if I should be approximating with (1 - v/c) or using the exact formula. Alternatively, since the velocities are non-relativistic, the approximation should be okay.

So, since the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, but Star_2 is moving towards us, the actual emitted λ_max of Star_2 is longer than Star_1's λ_max. Because when Star_2 emits at longer wavelength, our Doppler shift brings it down to the same observed λ as Star_1.

Wait, let me make this concrete. Suppose Star_1 emits at λ1, which is observed as λ1. Star_2 emits at λ2_emit, but because it's moving towards us, we observe λ2_obs = λ2_emit * (1 - v/c) = λ1. So λ2_emit = λ1 / (1 - v/c). Since v is positive (towards us), 1 - v/c is less than 1, so λ2_emit is larger than λ1.

But wait, according to Wien's law, λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So if λ2_emit is greater than λ1, then T2_emit is less than T1. Because λ_max = b/T. So T2_emit = b/(λ2_emit) < T1 = b/(λ1).

Wait, but wait. Because Star_2's actual λ_emit is longer. So T2 is lower than T1.

But then earlier I thought that T1 and T2 are the same because observed λ_max is the same. But that's only considering the observed wavelength. But the actual emission temperature is different because of the Doppler shift.

So I think this is a crucial point. Because the observed λ_max is the same, but the intrinsic temperatures are different due to the Doppler effect.

So, for Star_1: observed λ_max1 = emitted λ_max1 = b / T1 → T1 = b / λ_max1.

For Star_2: observed λ_max2 = λ_max1. But λ_max2_emit = λ_max2_obs / (1 - v/c). So T2_emit = b / λ_max2_emit = b / [λ_max1 / (1 - v/c)] ) = (b * (1 - v/c)) ) / λ_max1 = T1 * (1 - v/c).

Wait, because λ_max1 = b/T1. So substituting, T2_emit = (b (1 - v/c)) / (b/T1) ) = T1 * (1 - v/c). So T2 is lower than T1 by a factor of (1 - v/c).

Wait, but wait. Let me make that substitution again:

λ_max2_emit = λ_max2_obs / (1 - v/c) → since λ_max2_obs = λ_max1.

So λ_max2_emit = λ_max1 / (1 - v/c).

But since T is inversely proportional to λ_max, T2_emit = b / λ_max2_emit = b / (λ_max1 / (1 - v/c) ) = (b (1 - v/c)) ) / λ_max1.

But λ_max1 = b / T1, so substituting:

T2_emit = (b (1 - v/c)) ) / (b/T1) ) = T1 (1 - v/c).

So yes, T2 is T1 multiplied by (1 - v/c).

But wait, v is 700 km/s. Let's compute v/c. 700,000 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s is approximately 0.0023333 or 0.233%. So 1 - v/c ≈ 0.9976666.

But wait, if the star is moving towards us, its wavelength is blueshifted. So the λ_emit of Star_2 is longer than the measured λ_obs. So when we compute T2_emit, it's lower than T1, because λ is longer.

So T2_emit = T1 (1 - v/c).

Wait, but wait a minute, the Doppler effect formula for temperature. Because when a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths are blueshifted, so the observed temperature would be higher. But in this case, the observed λ_max is same, so the intrinsic emission must have a lower temperature, because the observed temperature is same.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Doppler shift affecting the effective temperature. Alternatively, maybe the star's actual temperature is T2, and the observed temperature is T2_obs = T2 / (1 - v/c). So since the observed λ_max is same as Star_1's, the observed temperature would be same as Star_1's.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wien's law: λ_max = b / T.

If a star is moving towards us at velocity v, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ). But when v is small, λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 - v/c).

So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 - v/c).

But in our case, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_emit1 = λ_obs1. For Star_2, λ_emit2 is such that λ_emit2 * (1 - v/c) = λ_obs2 = λ_obs1.

So λ_emit2 = λ_obs1 / (1 - v/c).

But λ_obs1 is λ_emit1, since Star_1 has v=0.

So λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 - v/c).

So, substituting into Wien's law for T:

T_emit1 = b / λ_emit1.

T_emit2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 / (1 - v/c) ) ) = (b (1 - v/c) ) / λ_emit1 = (1 - v/c) * T_emit1.

So T_emit2 = T_emit1 * (1 - v/c).

So the actual temperature of Star_2 is lower than Star_1 by (1 - v/c).

But wait, let me compute that numerically. v is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. c is 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/300 ≈ 0.0023333.

So (1 - v/c) ≈ 0.9976667.

So, T2 = T1 * 0.9976667.

But wait, no—wait, the star is moving towards us so its emitted wavelengths are blueshifted. But the observed λ_max for Star_2 is the same as Star_1, so Star_2's actual λ_emit is longer than Star_1's. So the actual T of Star_2 is lower than Star_1's.

So, to get the luminosity, we use L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So, for Star_1: L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴.

For Star_2: L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴.

We need to find L1/L2.

Given R1 = 1.5 R2.

T2 = T1 * (1 - v/c ) ≈ T1 * (1 - 0.0023333) ≈ T1 * 0.9976667.

So, let's compute L1/L2:

L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ ) = ( (1.5 R2 )² / ( R2² ) ) * ( T1^4 / ( (0.9976667 T1 )^4 ) )

Simplify R terms:

(1.5 R2 )² / R2² = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

Now the T terms:

(T1^4) / ( (0.9976667 T1 )^4 ) = [ T1 / 0.9976667 T1 ]^4 = (1 / 0.9976667)^4.

Calculate 1 / 0.9976667 = approximately 1.002335.

Wait, 0.9976667 is approximately 0.9976667, so 1/0.9976667 is about 1.002335.

So, (1.002335)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. Let's compute ln(1.002335) ≈ 0.00233 approx.

Multiply by 4: 0.00932.

Exponentiate: e^0.00932 ≈ 1.00937.

Wait, another approach: (1 + x)^n ≈ 1 + nx when x is small. Here, x is 0.002335, n=4.

So (1 + 0.002335)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.002335 = 1.00934.

So approximately 1.00934.

So, putting it all together: L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00934 ≈ 2.25 * 1.00934.

Compute 2.25 * 1.00934: 2.25 * 1 = 2.25, 2.25 * 0.00934 ≈ 0.021085. So total ≈ 2.271.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 2.25 * 1.00934 more accurately.

2.25 * 1.00934 = 2.25 + (2.25 * 0.00934) = 2.25 + 0.021085 = 2.271085.

So L1 is about 2.27 times L2.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, none of these are exactly 2.27, but the closest is option B, which is ~2.32. Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made an approximation too early. Let me check if I should have used a more precise calculation for (1 - v/c) or the exponents.

Wait, let's compute 1/(1 - v/c) more precisely. Because v is 7e5 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s.

v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333..., but wait, 7e5 is 700,000; 3e8 is 300,000,000. 700000 / 300000000 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait wait wait, no, 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7/(300) = 0.0233333... So 1 - v/c = 1 - 0.023333... = 0.9766666...

Wait wait, wait a second, did I get the velocity wrong earlier? Because 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, yes. So 700,000 / 3e8 is 0.00233333... So 1 - v/c = 0.9976666...

Wait, but earlier I thought v is 700 km/s. So 700,000 m/s. So 700,000/3e8 = 0.0023333333.

So (1 - v/c) = 0.997666667.

So 1/(1 - v/c) = 1/0.997666667 ≈ 1.002342.

So (1/(1 - v/c))^4 = (1.002342)^4.

Wait, let me compute 1.002342^4 accurately.

We can compute it step by step:

1.002342^2 = (1 + 0.002342)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.002342 + (0.002342)^2 ≈ 1.004684 + 0.00000548 ≈ 1.004689.

Then, 1.004689^2 ≈ (1.004689)^2.

Let me compute that:

1.004689 * 1.004689.

Approximately:

= 1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.004689 = 0.004689.

0.004689 * 1 = 0.004689.

0.004689 * 0.004689 ≈ 0.0000219.

So sum:

1 + 0.004689 + 0.004689 + 0.0000219 ≈ 1 + (0.009378 + 0.0000219) = 1.0093999.

So approximately 1.0094.

So (1/(1 - v/c))^4 ≈ 1.0094.

So T2_emit = T1 * (1 - v/c) = T1 * 0.9976667.

So T2 = T1 * 0.9976667.

Now, the L ratio is (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1²/R2² = (2.25).

T1^4 / T2^4 = (T1/(T1 * 0.9976667))^4 = (1 / 0.9976667)^4 ≈ (1.002342)^4 ≈ 1.0094.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.27085.

So approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B, which is ~2.32, but that's still a bit off. Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should consider the Doppler shift's exact formula, not the approximation. Let me think.

The exact Doppler shift formula for wavelength is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β) / (1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

But for small β, this is approximately λ_emit (1 - β).

But for precise calculation, perhaps I should use the exact formula.

So, let me compute (λ_emit2 / λ_emit1) = (λ_obs2 / (sqrt((1 - β)/(1 + β)) )) / λ_obs1.

But here, λ_obs2 = λ_obs1. So λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) = λ_emit1 * (1 + β/2 + ... ) when β is small.

But perhaps using the exact formula would give a more precise value for the temperature ratio.

So, the exact Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) = λ_obs1.

So, λ_emit2 = λ_obs1 / sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

= λ_obs1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

= λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Because λ_obs1 = λ_emit1.

So, T_emit2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )) )

= (b / λ_emit1 ) * 1/ sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

= T_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Hmm, that's a bit more precise.

So let's compute sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) with β=0.0023333.

Compute (1 - β) = 0.9976667, (1 + β)=1.0023333.

Ratio: 0.9976667 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.99537.

sqrt(0.99537) ≈ 0.99768.

So, T2 = T1 * 0.99768.

So, T2^4 = (0.99768)^4 * T1^4 ≈ (0.99768)^4 T1^4.

Compute (0.99768)^4.

Let me compute ln(0.99768) ≈ -0.00232.

Multiply by 4: -0.00928.

e^{-0.00928} ≈ 0.9908.

Alternatively, considering that (1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x, when x is small.

x = 0.00232. 4x = 0.00928.

So, (0.99768)^4 ≈ 1 - 4 * 0.00232 = 0.99072.

So, T2^4 = 0.99072 T1^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (1 / 0.99072) ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.271.

Wait, same as before. So about 2.27.

But none of the options match exactly. The options are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Hmm, maybe the initial assumption is that the temperatures are same, and the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity calculation. But that can't be right because the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature.

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait, maybe the peak wavelengths are the same in the rest frame, so the actual λ_max is same, so T is same. But that can't be, because one star is moving towards us. Alternatively, perhaps the lambda_max is measured in the rest frame, but how?

Wait, wait, no. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max is same. So the rest frame λ_max of each star would be different.

So, in that case, the temperatures are different.

But perhaps the way I approached it is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the luminosity ratio using the exact Doppler shift.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the actual T2 in terms of T1.

Wait, let me try to compute (1/(1 - v/c))^4 with v=700 km/s.

v/c=700e3 / 3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333... So wait, no! Wait a minute. Wait 700 km/s is 700,000 m/s, and 3e8 is 300,000,000 m/s. So 700000 / 300000000 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.0233333.

Wait, earlier I thought v/c was 0.002333, but that's wrong. I think I messed up the decimal places.

Because 700,000 is 7e5. 3e8 is 300,000,000.

700,000 /300,000,000 = 7/(300) = 0.023333333...

Wait, oh my god! I think I made a mistake earlier in my calculations. So this changes everything.

So v/c is 0.023333333.

So, (1 - v/c) = 0.976666667.

So, 1/(1 - v/c) = 1 / 0.976666667 ≈ 1.02408.

So, (1/(1 - v/c))^4 = (1.02408)^4.

Let me compute 1.02408^4.

First, 1.02408^2 = (approx) ?

Let me compute 1.02408 * 1.02408.

= 1*(1) + 1*(0.02408) + 0.02408*(1) + 0.02408^2.

= 1 + 0.02408 + 0.02408 + 0.0005798.

= 1 + 0.04816 + 0.0005798 ≈ 1.0487398.

So, 1.02408^2 ≈ 1.04874.

Now, compute 1.04874^2.

1.04874 * 1.04874.

= (1 + 0.04874)^2 = 1 + 2*0.04874 + (0.04874)^2.

= 1 + 0.09748 + 0.002375.

= 1.10 (approx).

So, 1.02408^4 ≈ 1.10.

Wait, more accurately:

0.04874^2 = ~0.002375.

So 1 + 0.09748 + 0.002375 = 1.10 (approx 1.099855).

So, 1.02408^4 ≈ 1.099855.

So, the factor for the temperature is (1/(1 - v/c)) = ~1.02408, so (1.02408)^4 ≈ 1.099855.

So, the T ratio is T2= T1 * (1 - v/c) = T1 * 0.976666667.

So, T2 = 0.97666667 * T1.

Wait, but the luminosity is proportional to T^4, so let's compute (T1 / T2)^4.

(T1 / T2) = 1 / 0.9766667 ≈ 1.02408.

So, (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (1.02408)^4 ≈ 1.099855.

Now, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4) = (2.25) * (1.099855) ≈ 2.25 * 1.099855.

Compute 2.25 * 1.099855:

2 * 1.099855 = 2.19971.

0.25 * 1.099855 = 0.27496375.

Adding together: 2.19971 + 0.27496375 ≈ 2.47467.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.47467.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B) ~2.32 and C) ~2.35. Wait, but 2.47 is higher than all the options. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the Doppler effect for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ), where β = v/c.

So, if a star is moving towards us (v positive), the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ).

So, for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) = λ_obs1.

So, λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Thus, T_emit2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )) )

= (b / λ_emit1 ) * (1 / sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )) )

= T_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So, T_emit2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

With β = 0.023333333, let's compute sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

= sqrt( (0.9766667) / (1.0233333) )

= sqrt(0.9766667 / 1.0233333 )

Compute 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 = approximately 0.9545.

sqrt(0.9545) ≈ 0.977.

So, T_emit2 ≈ T1 * 0.977.

So, T_emit2^4 = (0.977)^4 * T1^4.

Compute 0.977^4.

0.977^2 = approx 0.9545.

0.9545^2 ≈ 0.9109.

So, T_emit2^4 ≈ 0.9109 T1^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4/T_emit2^4) = (2.25) * (1 / 0.9109) ≈ 2.25 * 1.0978 ≈ 2.472.

So L1 is about 2.47 times L2.

But the options don't have anything near 2.47. The highest option is C) ~2.35.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is elsewhere. Let's think again.

Ah! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the Doppler shift direction. Wait, when a star moves towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ). So, λ_emit = λ_obs * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) = λ_obs * (1 + β/2 ) approximately.

But in our case, the observed λ_max for both stars is same. So, λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

For Star_2, λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) = λ_obs1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ).

Thus, T_emit2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )) ) = T_obs1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Because T_obs1 = b / λ_obs1.

So, T_emit2 = T_obs1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But wait, T_obs1 is the observed temperature of Star_1, which would be the same as T_emit1, since Star_1 isn't moving.

Wait, no. Because if Star_1 isn't moving, then T_obs1 = T_emit1.

But for Star_2, T_obs2 = T_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the relations wrong.

Wait, the observed temperature would be T_obs = T_emit * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Because when the star is moving towards us, the observed temperature is higher.

Wait, let me think in terms of Wien's law. The peak wavelength is observed to be λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So, the observed temperature is T_obs = b / λ_obs = (b/λ_emit) * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

= T_emit * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, for Star_1, since it's not moving, T_obs1 = T_emit1.

For Star_2, T_obs2 = T_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same, so λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So, T_obs1 = T_obs2.

So, T_emit1 = T_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, T_emit2 = T_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which is the same as before.

So, the ratio of temperatures is T_emit2 = T_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which, with β=0.023333333, gives T_emit2 = T1 * sqrt( (0.9766667)/(1.0233333) )

Compute 0.9766667 / 1.0233333 = 0.9545.

sqrt(0.9545) ≈ 0.977.

So, T_emit2 ≈ 0.977 * T1.

So, the luminosity ratio is L1/L2 = (R1² / R2²) * (T1^4 / T_emit2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1 / (0.977)^4 )

= 2.25 * (1 / 0.9109 ) ≈ 2.25 * 1.0978 ≈ 2.472.

But this is about 2.47, which isn't among the options. The options are all around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Alternatively, maybe the Doppler effect is negligible for the luminosity because the velocities are not that high. Wait, but 700 km/s is quite significant, so its effect can't be ignored.

Wait, but wait, the luminosity formula is L = 4π R² σ T^4. So, that's correct.

But perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the observed λ_max is the same, leading to same T_obs, but then the actual T_emit is adjusted by the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the observed λ_max is the same, so the observed temperatures are same, but the actual emission temperatures are different.

But according to the problem, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, meaning the observed λ_max, which is same for both.

So, in that case, the observed temperatures are same, but the actual emission temperatures are different.

Wait, but in that case, the actual T_emit would be same as observed T_obs, because for a star with zero velocity, T_emit = T_obs.

Wait, no. Because for Star_2, T_obs = T_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Because, as per earlier, T_obs = T_emit * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ).

But the observed T for both stars is same, so:

T_obs1 = T_emit1.

T_obs2 = T_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But T_obs1 = T_obs2 → T_emit1 = T_emit2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

Which rearranges to T_emit2 = T_emit1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Which brings us back to the same point.

So, if the observed temperatures are same, then the actual emission temperatures are different.

Thus, the calculation L1/L2 = 2.25 * (1/ (0.977)^4 ) ≈ 2.25 * 1.0978 ≈ 2.47.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the star's velocities affect the Doppler shift in a different way. Because the star is moving towards us, we see a blueshift, but the star's actual surface may be moving, affecting its emission. Hmm, but I think the approach we took is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the temperature is same because the observed λ_max is same, ignoring the Doppler effect. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual temperatures without considering the Doppler effect. If the observed λ_max is same, then T_obs is same. So, T1 = T2.

In that case, luminosity ratio would be (R1²/R2²) * (T1^4 / T2^4 ) = (2.25) * 1 = 2.25. So option A.

But the problem is, that would ignore the Doppler effect. But perhaps the problem is expecting that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the flux, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the luminosity is the intrinsic property, but the observed flux is affected by Doppler. However, the question is about the computed luminosity, which is based on the star's intrinsic properties.

Wait, the problem says, "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, when they compute the luminosity, they would use the radius and the temperature they measure (which is affected by Doppler shift).

Wait, perhaps that's the key. Because if they measure T_obs for Star_2 as same as T_obs for Star_1, then their computed luminosity would be based on T_obs, not the actual T_emit.

Wait, but that would be incorrect because the observed T is higher than the actual T_emit.

Wait, the problem says that they computed the luminosity using the blackbody assumption. So, perhaps they observe the same λ_max, so they assume same T for both stars, thus same T_obs.

But that would be incorrect because the velocities are different, so the actual T_emit would be different.

But perhaps the problem is assuming that the observed λ_max gives the same T for both stars, so T1 = T2.

In that case, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 = (1.5)^2 * (1)^4 = 2.25. So option A.

But this would mean that the Doppler shift is ignored in determining the temperature, which is probably not correct.

But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, considering that the velocities are small, so the factor is approximately 2.25.

But the options have option B as ~2.32, which is close to 2.25 * 1.03.

Wait, but earlier when I considered that v/c is 0.0233333, which is about 2.33% of the speed of light, which is not negligible. So, the Doppler shift effect should be considered.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

But T1 = T_obs, and T2 = T_obs * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

Wait, no, earlier conclusion was that T_emit2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1+β) )

But if T_obs is same for both, then T_obs1 = T_emit1 = T_obs2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, T_emit1 = T_obs2 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

But since T_obs1 = T_obs2, we have T_emit1 = T_obs1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

So, then T_emit2 = T_obs2 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

But T_obs1 = T_obs2 → T_emit1 = T_obs1 * sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )

T_emit2 = T_obs1 * sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) )

So, the ratio T1_emit / T2_emit = sqrt( (1 + β)/(1 - β) ) / sqrt( (1 - β)/(1 + β) ) ) = (1 + β)/(1 - β)

So, (T1_emit/T2_emit)^4 = ( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )^2.

So, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * ( (1 + β)/(1 - β) )^2.

Because L is proportional to R² T^4, and T is as above.

So, R1 = 1.5 R2 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

(1 + β)/(1 - β) = (1 + 0.023333)/ (1 -0.023333) = 1.023333 / 0.9766667 ≈ 1.04807.

So, (1.04807)^2 ≈ 1.098.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.098 ≈ 2.47.

Again, same as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake lies elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is wrong, and the problem states that the stars' luminosities are computed assuming they are black bodies, using the observed wavelengths.

In that case, the observed wavelength is used to compute T_obs, so T_obs is same for both stars.

So, the computed luminosities would be L = 4π R² σ T_obs^4.

So, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ T_obs^4.

L2 = 4π R2^2 σ T_obs^4.

So, L1/L2 = ( (1.5 R2)^2 ) / ( R2^2 ) ) = 2.25.

So, the ratio is 2.25, option A.

But this ignores the Doppler effect, which seems inconsistent with the problem statement. The problem states that they computed the luminosity considering blackbody radiation, but perhaps they accounted for the Doppler shift in the temperature measurement.

But perhaps the problem is considering only the Doppler shift affecting the observed flux, not the intrinsic luminosity. Hmm, but that's about observed flux (apparent brightness), not intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, the question is about the intrinsic luminosity, which depends on R and T.

But if the observed T is same for both, the computed luminosity would be based on T_obs, not the actual T_emit.

But we know that Star_2's actual T is lower than T_obs because of the Doppler shift. So, if the astronomers computed L based on T_obs, their calculation would be incorrect.

But the question says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So, perhaps the problem is that the computed luminosity ratio is based on the observed temperature, which is same for both. So, the ratio is 2.25. But considering the Doppler effect, the actual luminosity would be higher for Star_1.

But I'm getting confused, perhaps I should think of it this way:

If the observed λ_max is same, then the observed T is same. So, the computed L would be (R1² / R2²) * (T_obs^4 / T_obs^4 ) = 2.25.

But if the actual T_emit is different, the actual L would be higher for Star_1.

But the question is about the computed luminosities, not the actual. So, given that they compute based on observed T, the ratio would be 2.25.

So the answer would be option A) ~2.25.

But earlier calculations, considering the emitted T, give a higher ratio.

But perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, thus the correct answer is 2.25.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler effect to be considered, but the options don't match any calculation I can make.

Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is only considering the Doppler shift for the surface brightness or flux, not the luminosity. Because luminosity is an intrinsic property, but flux (observed brightness) would be affected by distance and Doppler.

But the problem is about luminosity, not flux.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only concerned with the ratio of the observed fluxes, but the question is about luminosity.

I'm getting stuck. Let's consider the options again.

The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

From my calculations, when considering the Doppler effect, the ratio is about 2.47, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to 2.25, option A.

But the problem states that the radial velocities are given; that must mean they are to be considered.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (1/(1 - v/c))^4.

Wait, when v is 700 km/s, beta is 0.002333333... No! Wait no, 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s, c is 3e8 m/s. So 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.023333333.

So beta is 0.023333333.

Thus, 1 - beta = 0.976666667.

So, (1/(1 - beta)) = 1.02408.

So, (1/(1 - beta))^4 = (1.02408)^4 ≈ 1.09985.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.09985 ≈ 2.47, which isn't an option.

Thus, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to 2.25, option A.

But the presence of the velocities in the problem suggests that it's a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the velocity is 70 km/s, not 700 km/s. Because 70 km/s would make beta 0.00023333, leading to a much smaller effect.

But the problem states 700 km/s, which requires a more significant correction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption that the observed T is same for both. Because, from the problem statement, the observed wavelengths are same, which leads to same T_obs. But Star_2's actual T_emit is lower.

So, the computed luminosity would be based on T_obs, which is same for both, leading to L1/L2 = 2.25.

But the actual luminosity of Star_2 is lower than computed, because its T_emit is lower than T_obs.

Wait, but the question says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2's. So, in their computation, they used the observed T (same for both), but in reality, Star_2's T is lower, so its actual luminosity is lower than computed.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the computed luminosity, not the actual.

So, in that case, the computed ratio is 2.25, option A.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the Doppler shift to be considered, but I'm missing the correct approach.

Another possibility: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, not the luminosity.

Wait, the flux F is L/(4 pi d^2), where d is the distance. But if the star is moving towards us, the flux increases due to Doppler boosting.

But the problem states that they computed the luminosities, so perhaps that's not the factor here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed surface brightness.

The surface brightness is (L / (4 pi R^2)) * (1 + v_r / c )^2.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the use of the Doppler shift in the calculation of the temperature, taking into account that the observed wavelengths are same, leading to the same T_obs, but the actual T_emit is lower for Star_2.

Thus, the computed luminosity for Star_2 would be L2_computed = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T_obs^4.

But the actual L2 is L2_actual =4 pi R2^2 sigma T_emit2^4.

And T_emit2 = T_obs * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, L2_computed / L2_actual = (T_obs / T_emit2 )^4 = [1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ]^4 = [ sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ]^4 = ( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )^2.

So, L2_computed = L2_actual * ( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )^2.

But the problem says that the computed L1 is compared to L2. So, if they compute L1 and L2 based on observed T (same for both), then L1_computed = 2.25 L2_computed.

But the actual L2 is L2_actual = L2_computed * ( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )^2.

So, the actual L1 is L1_actual = L1_computed.

Thus, L1_actual / L2_actual = (L1_computed ) / ( L2_computed * ( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )^2 ) )

= (2.25) / ( (0.9766667 / 1.0233333 )^2 )

= 2.25 / ( (0.9545 ) )

≈ 2.25 / 0.9109 ≈ 2.47.

But again, this leads to 2.47, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the computed luminosities, not the actual ones, leading to 2.25.

But given that, the correct answer would be option A.

But earlier calculations with the correct Doppler effect give a higher ratio, which isn't an option.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the most plausible answer is option B) ~2.32, which is close to 2.25 * 1.03, which might come from a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps when I computed 1.02408^4 as 1.09985, which is about 1.1, but perhaps the precise calculation yields closer to 1.097, leading to 2.25 * 1.097 = 2.47.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the Doppler shift, leading to option A. But the presence of the velocities suggests that it's a factor.

Another possibility: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but the actual temperature is same, so T1 = T2.

In that case, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, option A.

But that would ignore the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed for the Doppler shift's effect on the calculated luminosity to be considered, but I'm making a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute everything numerically without approximations.

Compute (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) with beta=0.023333333.

(1 + beta) = 1.023333333.

(1 - beta) = 0.976666667.

Ratio = 1.04807.

So, (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.04807.

Thus, (1 + beta/(1 - beta))^2 = (1.04807)^2 ≈ 1.098.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.098 = 2.47.

Hmm.

But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to find L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1_emit / T2_emit )^4.

But T1_emit = T1, and T2_emit = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So, (T1 / T2_emit )^4 = ( 1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )^4 = ( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )^2.

So, same as before.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, the only logical conclusion is that the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I'm not sure how that arises.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1 + beta)^2/(1 - beta)^2.

(1 + beta)^2 = (1.0233333)^2 ≈ 1.0473.

(1 - beta)^2 = (0.9766667)^2 ≈ 0.9540.

So ratio is 1.0473 / 0.9540 ≈ 1.097.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.097 ≈ 2.47.

Hmm. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier when I thought beta was 0.002333333 instead of 0.023333333.

Because 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(300) = 0.023333333.

So, all calculations after that are correct.

But since none of the options match, I'm forced to consider that the intended answer is option B) ~2.32.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed flux is the same for both stars, but that's not stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic Doppler shift formula, but that's unlikely given the velocities.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler effect on the luminosity distance, but that's about observed flux, not intrinsic luminosity.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. I'm going to conclude that the intended answer is option B) ~2.32, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach gives option C) ~2.35.

But according to the calculations, the ratio is approximately 2.47, which isn't among the options. But the options don't have that. Hence, perhaps the intended answer is option B) ~2.32.

Wait, another way: perhaps I should compute (1 + beta)^4 / (1 - beta)^4.

With beta=0.023333333.

(1 + beta) = 1.0233333 → (1.0233333)^4 ≈ 1.095.

(1 - beta)=0.9766667 → (0.9766667)^4 ≈ 0.907.

Ratio: 1.095/0.907 ≈ 1.207.

Then, L1/L2 = (2.25) * 1.207 ≈ 2.715.

But that's even further from the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the Doppler shift to be taken into account only for the observed wavelength, but the T is same. So, L1/L2 = 2.25.

But given that, option A is correct. But I'm not confident.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, assuming both stars radiate as black bodies. The key parameters provided are:

- **Star_1** has a radius \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and mass \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \).
- The observed peak wavelengths (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)) for both stars are the same.
- The radial velocities are \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).

### Key Analysis:

1. **Luminosity Formula**: The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
   \[
   L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
   \]
   where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

2. **Observed Wavelength and Temperature**: The observed peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{max, obs}} \)) is the same for both stars. Using Wien's law (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{b}{T} \)), the observed temperatures (\( T_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars:
   \[
   T_{\text{obs, 1}} = T_{\text{obs, 2}}
   \]
   However, the actual emission temperatures (\( T_{\text{emit}} \)) differ due to the Doppler effect.

3. **Doppler Effect on Temperature**: The relationship between the observed temperature and the actual emission temperature is:
   \[
   T_{\text{obs}} = T_{\text{emit}} \sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}
   \]
   where \( \beta = v/c \). For Star_2, moving toward the observer with \( v = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), the emission temperature is lower:
   \[
   T_{\text{emit, 2}} = T_{\text{emit, 1}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
   \]

4. **Luminosity Ratio**: The luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_{\text{emit, 1}}^4}{R_2^2 T_{\text{emit, 2}}^4}
   \]
   Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_{\text{emit, 2}} = T_{\text{emit, 1}} \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}} \), the ratio becomes:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_{\text{emit, 1}}}{T_{\text{emit, 2}}}\right)^4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \left(\sqrt{\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}}\right)^4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2
   \]

5. **Doppler Factor**: With \( \beta = v/c = 700 \, \text{km/s} / 300,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.002333 \), the Doppler factor is:
   \[
   \frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta} = \frac{1.002333}{0.997667} \approx 1.00466
   \]
   Squaring this gives:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1 + \beta}{1 - \beta}\right)^2 \approx 1.00933
   \]

6. **Final Luminosity Ratio**: Substituting back:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \times 1.00933 \approx 2.27
   \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated luminosity ratio is approximately \( 2.27 \). However, none of the provided options exactly match this value. The closest option is **B) ~2.32**, which is likely intended as the correct answer. This discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

Answer: B
