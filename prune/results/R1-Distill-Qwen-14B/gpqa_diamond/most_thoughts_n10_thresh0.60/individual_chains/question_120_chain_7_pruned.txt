Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away. Got it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that in any volume of space, there are the same number of stars. So the density is uniform. That makes sense. So the number of stars should depend on the volume available up to a certain distance.

Parallax and distance are related by the formula plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, if I have a parallax plx, the distance is 1/plx parsecs.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does the count change as parallax changes. Let's say I pick a small range of parallax, delta plx. I want to find how many stars are in that range.

Wait, since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a region is proportional to the volume of that region. So, if I consider all stars with parallax between plx and plx + delta plx, I need to find the volume corresponding to these stars.

Wait, but parallax is inversely related to distance. So, when plx increases (from, say, plx to plx + delta_plx), the distance decreases. So, for a given range in parallax, what is the corresponding range in distance?

Let me think: if plx is p, then distance d = 1/p. So, the distance for a parallax p is 1/p parsecs.

So, the range in distance from p to p + delta_p would be from 1/p to 1/(p + delta_p). Wait, maybe it's easier to express the range in terms of distance. Let me instead express delta_d in terms of delta_p.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider integrating over the volume in terms of parallax. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe an easier way is to think about the volume of a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness delta_d. The volume of such a shell
