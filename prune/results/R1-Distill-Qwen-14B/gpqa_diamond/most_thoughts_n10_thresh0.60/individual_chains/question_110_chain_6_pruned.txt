Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, the spectrographs in question are ESPRESSO at Paranal Observatory and HIRES at Keck Observatory. The question gives me some information about each star and the magnitude limits of each instrument.

Let me start by understanding the magnitude limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, meaning it can see stars with V magnitudes ≤17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so it can see up to 16 mag, right? So any star that's brighter (lower magnitude number) than these limits can be detected by each.

Now, each star's parameters are given. I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star because that's what the spectrographs' limits are based on. Apparent magnitude depends on the distance and any extinction (dust absorption) which is given by E(B-V) for some stars.

Wait, the formula for extinction in V band is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for a star with E(B-V), the observed apparent magnitude would be the intrinsic apparent magnitude plus Av. Oh wait, no, wait—it's more about how the star's light is dimmed. Let me think.

Wait, the star's actual apparent magnitude without extinction is m0, and the extinction adds to it. So the observed magnitude is m0 + Av. But wait, no, wait. Extinction makes stars appear fainter because dust scatters light. So if a star has an extinction Av, its apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_true + Av. Because higher magnitudes mean fainter objects.

Wait, let me double-check. The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. So if a star has an intrinsic apparent magnitude (like if there were no dust), and there's extinction, the observed magnitude is higher. So higher means it's dimmer, more difficult to detect.

So for each star, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (if given), and then check if that magnitude is ≤17 for ESPRESSO (so detectable by ESPRESSO) and ≤16 for HIRES (so detectable by HIRES).

Let me go through each star one by one.
