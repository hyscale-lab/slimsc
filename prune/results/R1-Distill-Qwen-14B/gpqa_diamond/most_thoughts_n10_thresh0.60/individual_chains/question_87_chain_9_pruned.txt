Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, wait. Wait, a di-substituted benzene ring would typically have two substituents. But the ring itself is 6 carbons, right? So if the total is 8, that means there are two substituents each adding a certain number of carbon atoms. So the ring has 6 carbons, plus two substituents totaling 2 carbons. Hmm, but wait, maybe the substituents are each one carbon, so each substituent adds one carbon. Wait, noâ€”wait, the substituents could be more complex.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the molecule has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Let's think about the substituents. Since the ring is di-substituted, we have two substituents attached to the benzene ring. 

So, the substituents are likely a halogen (like Cl, Br) and another group, which is the carbonyl-containing group. Alternatively, maybe both substituents are each a halogen and a carbonyl group? Wait, but the total carbons are 8. Let me think: benzene is
