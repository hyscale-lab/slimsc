Okay, so I've got this genetics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the gene responsible for the compound has five exons and four introns. But the focus seems to be on the first exon since the mutations are found there. The key is to find a mutation that disrupts the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound. I remember that mutations can disrupt genes in various ways—like causing a stop codon, altering the protein structure, or maybe even splicing issues.

Looking at the mutants, I need to compare their sequences to the intact gene. The anti-nutritional compound is likely a protein, so any mutation that changes the amino acid sequence might affect its function. Alternatively, a frameshift could cause a premature stop, leading to a truncated protein that might not be functional.

Let me look at each mutant:

Intact gene sequence: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCT...
So, comparing to the intact gene's first part, the fourth codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc. In Mutant 1, the sequence after TTT is CTACG. Let me break that down into codons. The original is TTT CTC GCT GGA... So, in Mutant 1, after TTT, perhaps it's CT ACG. Wait, maybe I should write out the original and mutant sequences.

Original first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CT ACG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, the original has CTC GCT. So, the original is CTC (Leu) followed by GCT (Ala). In Mutant 1, it's CT ACG. Hmm, that
