Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's see if I can work through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a line element in two dimensions. I remember that in GR, the metric tensor defines the geometry of spacetime. But here, x and y are the coordinates, probably in some kind of 2D space. Oh, wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere, which is a surface with constant negative curvature, right? So this must be a metric describing such a space.

Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with hyperbolic geometry. But wait, in the context of the metric here, perhaps it's a 2D space with hyperbolic-like properties. I think the area of a pseudosphere, or more generally a surface of revolution, can be calculated using some formula.

Wait, no, the pseudosphere in 2D is a bit abstract. Maybe I should think about the metric and figure out the geometry. The metric is given as a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So it's in the form of ds² = f(x,y)^2 (dx² + dy²), which is similar to the line element in polar coordinates, but here it's in terms of x and y.

Let me consider the function f(x,y) = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). Because the metric is conformally flat; that is
