Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to break this down step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. But it's supposed to describe a pseudosphere, right? Pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, like in hyperbolic geometry. But wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is a surface with negative Gaussian curvature, which is like a saddle shape.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, the radius in a pseudosphere context is a bit different. In the case of a hyperbolic space, the radius is related to the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K is related to the radius of curvature by K = -1/(r²). So if the radius is 2, then K is -1/(2²) = -1/4.

But wait, the metric given here needs to be in terms of the curvature. Let's look at the metric again. It's ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, I recall that in 2D, the line element for a space of constant curvature is often written in terms of a function of the radius. For example,
