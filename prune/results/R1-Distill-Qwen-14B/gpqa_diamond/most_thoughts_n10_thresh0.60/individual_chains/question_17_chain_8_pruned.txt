Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again. The question says: What's the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, assuming ideal pH and temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant K is given. Wait, K here is the formation constant, right? So the bigger the K, the more stable the complex, meaning the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

The problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Wait, but wait. Stochiometric ratio is 1:1, I think. So one EDTA binds one Ca²+ ion. So the complex is CaY²−, I guess Y stands for EDTA.

So the solution has 0.02 M of this complex. So the total concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M. But the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution.

I remember the formula for the formation constant. The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in solution, EDTA is usually in various protonated forms. Oh, the problem states that
