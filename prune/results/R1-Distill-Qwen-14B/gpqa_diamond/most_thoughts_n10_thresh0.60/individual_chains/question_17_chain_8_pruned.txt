Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Wait, right. EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like Ca²+. The complex formation is an equilibrium. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex.

The formula for the formation constant is K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴-]). Oh, but wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So, that's the concentration of the complex formed.

Assuming that the solution is at stoichiometric conditions, meaning the EDTA and Ca are in a 1:1 ratio. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That would mean that initially, if EDTA was in excess, but wait, no—since it's stoichiometric, maybe all the Ca is complexed? Or is some free?

Wait, no. The complex is formed, but the solution also has some free Ca²+ and some free EDTA, right? Because the complex doesn't form completely; some remains dissociated.

So, the total concentration of EDTA species would be [EDTA⁴-] + [CaEDTA²-] = 0.02 M? Or is it [EDTA⁴-] + [CaEDTA²-] + any other forms? Wait, I think EDTA can have multiple protonation states, but the problem says pH is ideal, so perhaps we can assume that the dominant species is EDTA^4-.

Wait, the problem states "pH is ideal", which probably means that the pH is such that EDTA is in its deprotonated form, Y^4-. So, we can ignore protonation effects.

So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10 (5x
