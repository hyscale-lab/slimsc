Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Okay, the question describes a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 is propene or propyne, but wait, wait. Propene is C3H6, right? Because propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so molecular formula is C3H6. Yeah, but wait, another possibility is cyclopropane maybe, but I think propene makes more sense here.

So, the first reaction is bromination in the presence of CCl4. Bromination of alkenes, like propene, in CCl4 would likely be an addition reaction. Propene has a double bond, so under these conditions, it probably undergoes bromine addition. So, adding Br2 across the double bond. So, propene (CH2=CHCH3) would add Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. So that's compound B.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if it's a cyclic bromonium ion formation leading to anti addition. So for propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So yes, that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this is likely an elimination reaction. So, when a vicinal dihalide (like 1,2-dibromopropane) reacts with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation, removing two Br atoms and forming an alkene. So, the product would be propene again, I guess, but wait, wait.

Wait, the structure of B is 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. When it adds Br2, it becomes BrCH2CHBrCH3? No, because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So adding Br2 would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? Wait, but that's not possible because that would be 1,2-dibromopropane. So, when you eliminate HBr from that, what's the structure?

When you have 1,2-dihalide and eliminate, you lose two HBr molecules. So, the reaction would form an alkene. The possible al
