Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when a charge is moving, it's not just the electric field that matters, but also the magnetic field comes into play because of the moving charge. Oh right, that's where the vector potential A and scalar potential V come in.

The question is about finding expressions for V and A when a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time is v.

Wait, so the setup is that the charge was at some position at time tr, and the field we're seeing now is at time t, which is later than tr. So the light travel time from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r is considered.

I think the potentials are calculated using the retarded time concept. Right, because the fields propagate at the speed of light, so the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. So the variables would involve the vector d, which is r minus the position of the charge at tr, maybe something like d = r - s(tr). Or wait, the problem says d is from the field generating point to r, so d would be r - s(tr) maybe? Or perhaps the other way around, because the vector from the generating point (s(tr)) to r would be d = r - s(tr). But I'm not entirely sure, but that's probably the case.

The potentials V and A come from the multipole expansion, but for a point charge, we probably just consider the monopole terms, since higher multipoles would be negligible or zero if the charge distribution is a point.

Wait, scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, but when considering retarded time, does that change? Oh wait, scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - s(tr)|) ), but considering the retarded time. Wait, no, wait a second: the scalar potential for a moving charge is still the same as the static case, because the scalar potential depends only on the charge's position at the retarded time, without any time delay in the same way the vector potential does.

Wait, no, actually
