Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and try to understand each step carefully.

The question is about the reactions of 1,3-dibromoadamantane and the subsequent products formed through a series of reactions. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

So, let's break down each reaction step by step.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated to 240°C with excess KOH, giving a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has specific signals. The IR has an absorbance around 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). 

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a polycyclic compound. Heating with KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, probably leads to elimination. So, each Br is replaced by an OH, but wait, maybe not. Wait, no, wait. If it's a dihalide and KOH is used, elimination could happen. Alternatively, it's a double elimination, forming a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? Wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the positions are across the ring. Hmm, but not entirely sure. Alternatively, when KOH is used, perhaps a double elimination occurs, removing both Br atoms and forming a double bond. Because when two adjacent Br atoms are present, KOH can cause an elimination reaction, producing an alkene.

Wait, but the product after KOH has an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl. So if elimination occurs, we might have an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have carbonyls. Or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the compound is an alcohol. Wait, but wait, maybe it's a dihydroxy compound, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation. So, two dehydrohalogenations would form a diene. But that might not give a carbonyl. Or wait, maybe it's a different kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else
