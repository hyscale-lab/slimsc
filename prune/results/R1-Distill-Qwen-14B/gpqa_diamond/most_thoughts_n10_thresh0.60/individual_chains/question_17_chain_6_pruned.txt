Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says there's a 0.02 M solution of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, Ca-EDTA is a complex ion, right? So the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- or something like that. The K for the complex is given as 5x10^10. I think K here is the formation constant, which tells us how strong the complex is.

Wait, formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, and Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). So that's correct.

In this problem, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But because it's in solution, it will dissociate a little. But given that Kf is so large (5e10), the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions will be very low.

So the initial concentrations:
[CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M
[Ca²+] ≈ 0 (but not exactly, because of dissociation)
[EDTA^4-] ≈ 0 (again, because it's a strong complex)

Wait, but when the complex dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let me write the equation:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But wait, another approach: the dissociation of the complex can be represented by the reverse of the formation reaction. The dissociation constant Kd would be 1/Kf.

So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, no, Kd is the dissociation constant. So if Kf is formation, Kd is 1/Kf.

So the dissociation
