Okay, so I've got this question about an algorithm that converts DNA sequences into numbers. Hmm, let me think through this. The question gives two examples:

AGG → 115
TGCTGA → 176

And then asks what value ACAGTGACC gives. The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Wait, I need to figure out how the algorithm works. Let's look at the first example: AGG is 115. So each nucleotide must be converted into a number somehow. 

AGG has three nucleotides: A, G, G. Let's see if each is assigned a value. Maybe A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Wait, let me think. If that's the case, then let's see:

AGG would be 1,4,4. Maybe added together? 1+4+4=9. But 9 isn't 115. Hmm, that's not right. Maybe it's multiplied? 1 *4 *4 = 16. Still not matching 115.

Another approach: perhaps each base is converted to a number, and then each position is a digit in a base-n number. Since DNA has four bases, maybe it's base 4. Wait, but base 4 digits go from 0 to 3. Hmm, but the letters are A, T, C, G. Let's assign them numbers.

Wait, maybe A is 0, T is 1, C is 2, G is 3. Let's try that. For AGG, which is A, G, G. So 0,3,3. 

If it's a base 4 number, then 0*4^2 +3*4^1 +3*4^0 = 0 +12 +3 =15. Not 115. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are reversed, like the first nucleotide is the least significant digit. So AGG is 3,3,0. So 3*4^0 +3*4^1 +0*4^2 =3 +12 +0=15. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe each letter is assigned a value and then the number is built as a base-10 number where each digit is the value of the base. Wait, but
