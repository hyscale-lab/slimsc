Okay, so I've got this problem here where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and gives a specific numerical output. My task is to figure out what the output is for the input ACAGTGACC based on the examples given. Let me start by looking at the examples.

The first example is AGG -> 115. Let me write that down. The input is AGG and the output is 115. The second example is TGCTGA -> 176. Hmm. I need to figure out what kind of calculation is being done here.

I know that in DNA sequences, each nucleotide is A, T, C, G. Maybe each letter is being converted into a number, and then summed or something. Let me think about possible ways.

Let's break down AGG. A is the first letter, then G, then G. If each letter is assigned a number, like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4, that's a common approach. Let's see: A is 1, G is 4, another G is 4. So 1 + 4 +4 equals 9. But the output is 115. Wait, that's way off. So that approach probably isn't right.

Another thought: Maybe each nucleotide is being converted to its position in the alphabet. A is 1, G is 7, another G is 7. Sum is 1+7+7=15. Still not 115. Hmm.

Wait, maybe each character is being treated as a digit in a base-5 number. Because there are 4 possible letters, so base 4? Or base 5? Let me think. Maybe each letter represents a digit in a different base. Let me see.

Wait, let's think about the first example: AGG gives 115. How can 115 be derived from AGG? Let's assign A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Then AGG would be 0,3,3. If that's a base-4 number, 0*4^2 +3*4^1 +3*4^0 = 0 + 12 +3 =15. Not 115. Hmm.

Wait maybe it's a different mapping. Let me try A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. So AGG is 1,4,4. As a base-10
