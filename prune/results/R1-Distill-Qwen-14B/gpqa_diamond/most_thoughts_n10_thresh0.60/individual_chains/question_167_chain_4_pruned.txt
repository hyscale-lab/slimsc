Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, the question gives me the state as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). And the parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity is measured using relative entropy, del_b, which is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of a reference Gaussian state. So, del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait, right, rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian state. But I'm a bit confused about what exactly the reference Gaussian state is here. Because for the cat state, the reference could be a coherent state or maybe a thermal state? Or perhaps the reference is a Gaussian state that's the closest in some sense to the cat state?

But wait, no, I remember that for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference state is usually the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. Because otherwise, the comparison wouldn't make much sense. So, the reference Gaussian state tau would have the same first moments (like the mean photon number) and the same second moments (like the variance in position and momentum) as the non-Gaussian state rho.

Alternatively, sometimes people use the closest Gaussian approximation, which would be the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments. So maybe that's what tau is.

So, to compute del_b, I need to find the von Neumann entropy of rho and subtract the entropy of tau.

But wait, wait. The problem says the state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, and we're comparing it to a Gaussian state tau.

But how do I compute the entropy for these states?

Let me think about the structure of the state. The state is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|
