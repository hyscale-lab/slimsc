Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is the relativistic version, so things might be a bit different from the classical case.

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D, each with different formulas involving c, which is the speed of light. Oh right, in relativity, as objects move faster, their mass increases, which affects things like momentum and energy. So maybe that plays a role here.

Let me think about the classical harmonic oscillator first. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a spring, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that equals (1/2)m v_max². Solving for v_max gives sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic scenario, so option C is probably not the answer.

But wait, the options have some with c in them. So I need to consider relativistic effects. In relativity, energy isn't just (1/2)m v² anymore. The total energy includes the rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²
