Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle and how its magnetic moment oscillates when the magnetic field changes direction. 

Alright, let's break it down. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. The initial setup is a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I remember that when a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque which affects its orientation. The magnetic moment tends to align with the field. But since this is a spin-1/2 particle, it's a quantum mechanical system. So maybe I should think in terms of energy levels and transitions.

Originally, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's spin is aligned along Z. When the field is switched to +Y, the system's Hamiltonian changes. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, H would be proportional to Sz when B is along Z, right?

Wait, no, more precisely, the magnetic dipole moment is mu = gamma S, where S is the spin operator. So in the initial state, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma B S_z. The eigenvalues of S_z are ± ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles. But wait, wait, the spin matrices are usually in units of ħ, so S_z can be ± (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. But in terms of energy, the eigenvalues are E = -gamma B * (m_s * ħ/2). Wait, maybe I should get back to the problem.

So when the magnetic field is along Z, the particle's spin is in the eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's in the up state, so the energy is E_up = -gamma B * (ħ/2) * (1/2)? Wait, maybe I'm mixing factors here. Wait, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy for spin up along Z would be E_up
