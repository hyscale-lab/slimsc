Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let's see what the problem is about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given conditions are ideal pH and a temperature of 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of how strong the complex is. The higher the K, the more stable the complex.

Wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. I'm assuming that this is the total concentration of the complex, meaning all the calcium is bound by EDTA. But I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think I need to use the formation constant expression. The formation constant, K, is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. For the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

The expression for K would be K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since the complex is formed, [CaEDTA^2-] is the concentration of the complex, which is 0.02 M.

But wait, if all the calcium is tied up in the complex, then the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low. That makes sense because EDTA is a strong chelator, especially with high K values.

So, the problem is essentially asking for the concentration of free Ca²+ ions when the complex is in solution. Since K is very large (5e10), the complex is stable, so the free Ca²+ should be very small.

Let me think about the approximation. If the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M.

Assuming that the amount of free Ca²+ is much smaller than the concentration of the complex, maybe I can approximate [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4-] as being equal to each other because the stoichiometry is 1:1. Because for every Ca²+ that dissociates, one EDTA^4- is released.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial solution is 0.02 M of the complex. Let's denote [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of free Ca²+. Then, since each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4- would both be x.

So the K expression becomes:

K = [CaEDTA^2-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 =
