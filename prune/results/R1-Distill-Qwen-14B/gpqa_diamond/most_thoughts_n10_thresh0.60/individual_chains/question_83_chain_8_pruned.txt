Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about titrating a solution of acetic acid with NaOH. Here's the setup: we start by taking 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid and diluting it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I need to figure out the details of the initial solution after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20 cm³, and we're adding the same volume of water, making the total volume 40 cm³. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 20.00 cm³ each, so total volume is 40 cm³. But wait, maybe I should double-check.

The initial concentration is 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be half, because concentration is inversely proportional to volume when moles are constant. So 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid in 40 cm³.

Wait, no. Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. When you add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Right.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid.

But the question is about 25% titration and equivalence point. Let me tackle them one by one.

First, let's find the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, I think I need to figure out the equivalence point volume first. So, moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.04 L * 0.025 M = 0.001 moles. Each mole of acetic acid requires one mole of NaOH for neutralization. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume required is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01
