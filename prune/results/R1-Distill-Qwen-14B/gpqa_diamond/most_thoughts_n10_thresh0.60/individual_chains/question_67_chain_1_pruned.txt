Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. Oh wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait, but wait a second. The total angular momentum quantum number l is the sum of l1 and l2 when they're aligned, right? Because for two particles, the possible total l values are |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Since both are 1, the possible l's are 0,1,2. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. The eigenvalues are -ħ each. So we're looking for the probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ.

Wait, but the given state is a coupled state. So I think we need to express this coupled state in terms of the product states of individual states. Because the measurement is in the individual basis.

In the coupled state notation, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is a combination of product states |m1, m2>, where m = m1 + m2. So for the given state with l=2 and
