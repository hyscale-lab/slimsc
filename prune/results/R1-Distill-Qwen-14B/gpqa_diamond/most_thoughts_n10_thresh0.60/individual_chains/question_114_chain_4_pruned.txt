Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given. Let me break it down.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide, which is a cyanide source. I think when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it might undergo some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

Wait, another thought: I remember that the addition of HCN to a ketone typically happens under acidic conditions. So the reaction between a ketone and HCN (or its source) with acid would give a cyanohydrin. Oh, right, that's it. So butan-2-one plus HCN (from NaCN?) with acid (like H3O+ or H2SO4) would form the cyanohydrin. So for the first step, the reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is an acid, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which acts as a bisulfite. Wait, but in the context of HCN addition, I think the acid is H+ from H2SO4 or H3O+.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would add a hydroxyl and a nitrile group to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would have an OH and CN attached to the same carbon. That makes sense.

So the first step uses NaCN and an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+ maybe, or another acid. Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+. So that could be a possibility.

The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, the starting material has a nitrile group (CN) and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the reaction is converting CN to COOH.

How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids usually requires strong acidic or basic conditions, possibly with heat. Alternatively, using H3O+ and heat might work, but another method involves using a strong acid.

Wait, wait. The reaction is in the presence of water. Oh, right, the nitrile is hydrolyzed in water. But what reagent B is that? Let me think about the reagents available. The options for B are HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid).

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis can be
