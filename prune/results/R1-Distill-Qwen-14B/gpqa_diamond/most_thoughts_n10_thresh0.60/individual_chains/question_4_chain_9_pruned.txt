Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both north and south poles; you can't isolate a single pole. But the question is about how Maxwell's equations would change if that wasn't the case.

Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? Let me try to recall them. 

The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which deals with the divergence of the electric field and relates it to charge density. That's ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, ∇·B = 0. The third is Faraday's Law of induction, which involves the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic flux. The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which deals with the curl of the magnetic field and includes the displacement current.

In our universe, the second equation, ∇·B = 0, holds true because there are no isolated magnetic poles. So if in this parallel universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean that the divergence of B is not zero. So Gauss's Law for magnetism would change. That equation would no longer be valid as is.

Wait, but what about the other equations? The first equation is about electric fields and charge, which shouldn't be affected by the nature of magnetic poles. The third equation, Faraday's Law, involves the time derivative of the magnetic field. I don't think that equation would change because it's about how changing B fields create E fields, regardless of whether B has sources or not.

The fourth equation, Ampère's Law, deals with the curl of B and relates it to the current and displacement current. If B can have sources (monopoles), would that affect this equation? Hmm, Ampère's Law is about the circulation of B being proportional to the current plus displacement current. I think the presence of magnetic monopoles would require a different form for this equation as well. Wait no, because Ampère's Law is about how B fields circulate around currents. But if B can have sources, maybe the equation would need to account for them. Or wait, maybe the equation itself wouldn't change because Ampère's Law is about the curl of B, not the divergence. So if B has sources, then the divergence would be non-zero, but the curl (which is about loops) would still relate to the currents.

Wait, but the second equation is the divergence of B equals zero. If we have isolated magnetic poles (monopoles), then ∇·B would equal some multiple of the magnetic charge density, not zero. So in that case, the second equation would definitely change.

What about the fourth equation, Ampère-Maxwell Law? Our current version is ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t). If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B is non-zero. But Ampère's Law is about the curl, not the divergence, so the equation itself wouldn't change. Or does the presence of magnetic monopoles affect another aspect of Maxwell's equations?

Wait, I think when magnetic monopoles exist, there's another equation added. Oh wait, in that case, Maxwell's equations would have to be modified to include magnetic charge. So, the modified equations would have a divergence of B equal to rho_m (magnetic charge density) times some constant, and maybe the curl of E would relate to the magnetic current.

Wait, let me think again. In the standard equations, the four are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

If we have magnetic monopoles, then equation 2 would change to ∇·B = μ₀_m ρ_m (or something like that). Also, equation 3 might change. Because in the standard case, the curl of E is about the
