Okay, so I've got this chemistry question to tackle. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about isomers and some specific properties. There are two parts: part A and part B. The options given are A, B, C, D, each pairing answers for A and B.

First, let's understand the question. It says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers. They're divided into constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different structures, while stereoisomers have the same structure but different spatial arrangements (like cis and trans or enantiomers).

The question has two parts:

A) Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does NOT show tautomerism.

B) Between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures with the movement of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds. This usually involves the transfer of a hydrogen atom from one atom to another adjacent one, causing a shift in double bonds. Examples include keto-enol tautomerism.

And optical isomerism, or enantiomerism, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, leading to non-superimposable mirror images. For a compound to have optical isomers, it must have a chiral center (or multiple in a way that they don't cancel each other out).

So, starting with part A: Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Which doesn't show tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. There are different types of quinones. Benzoquinone could be 1,4-benzoquinone or para-benzoquinone. But wait, does it have the possibility of tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism usually requires a conjugated system where a hydrogen can shift, moving a double bond. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Can it undergo any kind of tautomerism? I think not because both carbonyl groups are in a conjugated structure, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it has a ring structure that doesn't allow for such shifts.

Wait, another possibility is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, each opposite each other. Does this structure allow for tautomerism?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Let me visualize: O=C-O-C-O-C... No, wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a ring with carbonyl groups at three alternate positions. So it's O=C-C-O-C-C-O, forming a six-membered ring with three ketone groups.

Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, would any tautomerism be possible? For tautomerism, I think you need conjug
