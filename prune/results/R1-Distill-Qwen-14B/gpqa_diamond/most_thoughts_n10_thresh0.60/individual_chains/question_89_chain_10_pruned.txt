Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a very rigid structure. So 1,3-dibromo means there are Br atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, like an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe a di-elimination happens. When you eliminate HBr from each Br, you form a double bond. But wait, in adamantane, the structure is quite rigid. So two adjacent Brs? Or are they in positions that would allow a conjugated diene after elimination?

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the bromines are on adjacent carbons in a way that when you eliminate, you can form a conjugated diene? I'm not sure. Let me think. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent positions. So when you eliminate HBr, you form a double bond between C1 and C2, and another between C3 and C4? Or maybe a single double bond if only one elimination occurs. Wait, but KOH in excess and heat usually lead to complete elimination. So maybe it goes to the most substituted product.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane elimination would form a diene. So the product after KOH is probably a diene. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense for an alkene, maybe a conjugated diene which would be more stable—like a diamondoid diene.

The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Let me think about what these signals could be. The peak at 4.79 ppm is probably a -CH2- group next to something electronegative, maybe an oxygen. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1,
