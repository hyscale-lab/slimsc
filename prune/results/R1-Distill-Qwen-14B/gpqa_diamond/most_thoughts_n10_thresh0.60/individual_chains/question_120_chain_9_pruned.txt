Okay, so I've got this question about stars' distribution and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula for parallax (plx) is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So a larger parallax means a closer star. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, I think parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, a star that's 10 parsecs away has a parallax of 0.1 arcseconds. Got it.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, the same number of stars per cubic parsec everywhere. Let's say n stars per pc³. Or maybe it's uniformly distributed in terms of volume. So, the volume of a sphere determines the number of stars.

Wait, but how does that translate into the number of stars per unit parallax range? Hmm. Let's think about it.

Parallax is 1/d. So, if we have a range of parallaxes from plx to plx + dplx, that corresponds to a certain distance range. Because plx is 1/d, plx increases as d decreases. So a small range in plx might correspond to a big range in distance, or vice versa.

Let me think in terms of distances. Suppose we have a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). But wait, since plx is small (for stars in the sky), we might approximate this. Or maybe we can think about the differential.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the number of stars within a certain parallax shell. So, for a given parallax plx, the distance is d = 1/plx. So, if we consider a thin shell between d and d + dd, the volume of this shell is 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell volume is approximately 4πr² dr for thin shells.

Since the stars are uniformly
