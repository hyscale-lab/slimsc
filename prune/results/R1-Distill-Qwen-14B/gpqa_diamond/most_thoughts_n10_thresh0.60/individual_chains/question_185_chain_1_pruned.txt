Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H, which is given as ε times the dot product of the Pauli vector σ and a unit vector n. 

Wait, I remember that the Pauli spin matrices, σ, are a vector of three 2x2 matrices. So σ·n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Oh right, each σ component is a Pauli matrix.

The Hamiltonian is H = ε σ·n. Since σ·n is a 2x2 matrix, H is also a 2x2 matrix. To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the trace and determinant or maybe find the matrix representation and solve for the eigenvalues.

Wait, wait, another approach. The Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues... oh right, each Pauli matrix squared is the identity matrix. So σ·n is a matrix whose square is equal to (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Let me compute that.

Expanding that square: σ·n squared equals n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + (n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_x σ_y σ_x + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z + n_z n_x σ_z σ_x + n_z n_y σ_z σ_y). 

But wait, I remember that σ_i squared is I (identity matrix) for each i, so each σ_i^2 = I. So the terms n_x^2, n_y^2, n_z^2 each multiply I. Also, the cross terms involve products of Pauli matrices. I recall that σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k when i≠j, but that's for the antisymmetric case. Alternatively, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, the square (σ·n)^2 can be expressed in terms of the identity matrix. Let me think. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So when I square σ·n, I get (σ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z
