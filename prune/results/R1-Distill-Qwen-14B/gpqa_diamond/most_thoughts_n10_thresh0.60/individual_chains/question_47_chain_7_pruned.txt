Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound given its IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's see what I can figure out.

The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20 -11 +1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond (1), and an amide or ester group (maybe another double bond or ring? Wait, no. An amide group has a carbonyl, so that's a double bond. So 3 (benzene) + 1 (amide carbonyl) + 1 (another double bond?) Maybe that's possible, but wait, maybe it's a benzene ring and two carbonyls, but that would give more degrees.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring (3), two double bonds (like two amide or ester groups?), but let me think again. Alternatively, a benzene ring plus a ketone or ester group and another double bond or ring. I'll come back to that.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are broad and strong, so likely N-H stretches. But wait, amide groups or amines? Amide N-H is usually around 3300-3500, and amines are similar, but if they're broad, maybe it's an amide. Alternatively, maybe an amide is present.

The IR also has a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for esters or amides. Esters have around 1730-1750, while amides are
