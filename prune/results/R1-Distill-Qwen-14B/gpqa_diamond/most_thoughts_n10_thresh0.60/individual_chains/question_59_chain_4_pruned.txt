Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution. Let me read the question again. It says: Determine the pH of the solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A through D.

Hmm. I remember that pH is about the concentration of H+ ions in a solution. But wait, when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I need to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions, see which one is in excess, and then calculate the pH based on that.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? But wait, it's a solution, so the moles would be volume multiplied by concentration. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. So moles of CH3COOH would be 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol.

Next, HCl. That's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The volume is 400 mL, 0.4 L. Concentration is 0.2 M. So moles of HCl would be 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 mol. Since HCl gives one H+ per molecule, that's 0.08 mol H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives two OH- ions. The volume is 300 mL, 0.3 L. Concentration is 0.3 M. So moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react. The H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base to form water. So I should calculate which is in excess: H
