Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me break that down.

First, I need to figure out the substituents on the benzene ring. The numbering might be a bit tricky. Let's see: the 2 position has a tert-butyl group, the 1 has ethoxy, and the 3 has nitro. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). 

So the substituents are in the order: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Wait, that would make them all adjacent to each other, right? So the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions. That's a meta arrangement for some groups but maybe ortho for others?

When adding substituents to benzene, each new group is added in a way that it's directed by the existing substituents. So the order in which the groups are added probably matters a lot.

Let me think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy (-OCH2CH3): This is an activating group, ortho/para-directing.
2. tert-Butyl: This is a bulky substituent. I think it's a deactivating group because it's an alkyl group. Wait, alkyl groups are actually activating (since they're electron-donating via inductive effect). So they are activating, but because of their size, they direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, but due to steric hindrance, the para position is more favored.
3. Nitro group (-NO2): That's a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

The target molecule has three substituents, so their order of addition will determine their positions. Let me consider the possible steps.

Let me outline the possible steps. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to find which sequence leads to the correct structure.

The target is
