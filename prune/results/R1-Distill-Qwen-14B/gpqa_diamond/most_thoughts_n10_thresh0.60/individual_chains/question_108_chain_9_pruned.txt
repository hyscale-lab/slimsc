Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me read through it again. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism has to do with magnetic fields affecting atomic structure, maybe through the Zeeman effect or something like that.

The setup says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, and it's a small value of m (the orbital magnetic quantum number). Oh wait, and B is 1 Tesla. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (H) due to this magnetic field with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series, maybe corresponding to the H-alpha line.

So, I think the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two states in the hydrogen atom. Let's see, the formula for the energy levels of hydrogen is E_n = - (13.6 eV) / n². The transition wavelength λ corresponds to a photon energy. I can compute ΔE using the photon energy equation: ΔE = hc / λ.

Wait, let me write down the numbers. The wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. The speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s, and Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So, ΔE should be hc divided by λ.

Calculating that: h is 6.626e-34 J·s, c is 3e8 m/s, λ is 486.1e-9 m. So ΔE ≈ (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9). Let me compute that step by step.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = approx 4.088e-18 J. Wait, but that's in joules. Let me convert that to electron volts because the paramagnetic term is usually discussed in eV.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 25.5 eV. Wait, that seems high. Wait, because the Balmer series transition, which is from n=2 to n=1, but wait no, wait the Balmer series is n=2 to n=1? No, wait. Wait no, the Balmer series is transitions ending at n=2. Oh wait, the Balmer alpha
