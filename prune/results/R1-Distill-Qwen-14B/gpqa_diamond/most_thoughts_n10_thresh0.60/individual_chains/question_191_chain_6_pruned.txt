Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what's going on.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So it's a cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (like a CH2OH), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like an isopropenyl group, right? So that's CH2-C(CH2- something? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 1 and 2? Wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me get this right. Prop-1-en-2-yl would be: the main chain is three carbons, with the double bond starting at C1, so it's CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is prop-1-en-
