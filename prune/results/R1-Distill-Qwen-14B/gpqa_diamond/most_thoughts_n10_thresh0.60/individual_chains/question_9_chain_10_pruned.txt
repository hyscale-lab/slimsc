Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, and I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The options are A, B, C, D, each a different compound.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. I recall that symmetry elements in molecules include things like axes and planes. C3h, I think, is a type of symmetry that includes a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So any molecule with C3h symmetry should have a threefold rotation (meaning you can rotate it 120 degrees and it looks the same) and also a horizontal mirror plane that reflects the molecule onto itself.

Now, let's go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I'm not too familiar with that structure, but triisopropyl borate typically has a boron atom connected to three isopropyl groups. The structure is something like (i-Pr)3BO. Isopropyl groups have a certain symmetry, but the molecule as a whole, I'm not sure. Wait, triisopropyl borate is actually a trigonal planar molecule because the three isopropyl groups are arranged symmetrically around boron. So each isopropyl is like a substituent attached to a central point, making the molecule symmetric. But does it have C3h symmetry?

Wait, C3h requires a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane. If the molecule is trigonal planar, maybe it has a threefold axis perpendicular to the plane. So if I imagine looking down the B atom, the three isopropyl groups are arranged 120 degrees apart. That would imply a threefold rotation axis (C3) perpendicular to the plane. But for C3h, there also needs to be a horizontal mirror plane. Would that be present?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry in the middle. But if the mirror plane is horizontal, that would mean it's parallel to the plane of the molecule. For a planar molecule, the mirror plane would pass through the central atom. But in the case of triisop
