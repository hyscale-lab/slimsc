Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it step by step. The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. 

The problem statement says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

The options are A to D, each giving two pH values. Let's break this down.

First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me compute that: 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001, divided by 0.04 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait a second. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. When you dilute it, the concentration decreases, which makes sense. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration. The NaOH is 0.1 M, and we're titrating until 25% and at equivalence.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. So, I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid initially.

Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

So, at equivalence, moles of NaOH added should be 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume is moles / concentration. So, volume NaOH = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question doesn't directly ask about the volume; it asks about the pH.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate (CH3COO^-). The solution will contain sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so the solution will be basic. 

So, the pH at equivalence will depend on the hydrolysis of acetate ions. The process is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Ka * Kb = Kw (1e-14 at 25°C). So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

But wait, let me compute that accurately. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is approximately (1 /1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is about 0.5405, so 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence is the moles divided by the total solution volume. The solution after equivalence has the initial volume plus the NaOH added. Wait, initial solution is 40 cm³. Adding some NaOH, but at equivalence, the volume is 40 + 10 =
