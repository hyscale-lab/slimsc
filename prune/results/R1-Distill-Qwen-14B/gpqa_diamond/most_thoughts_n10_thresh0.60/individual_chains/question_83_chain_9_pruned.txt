Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it.

So the problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I think I'll start by figuring out the initial concentration after dilution. Oh wait, when you mix equal volumes, you can just halve the concentration, right? So original volume is 20 cm³, then add another 20 cm³, making 40 cm³ total. So the initial concentration after dilution would be 0.05 M / 2 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that makes sense.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. So I'll need to find out how much NaOH is used at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, let's think about the equivalence point first because that's easier. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate. But wait, acetate is a weak base, so the solution will be basic. So the pH at equivalence will be higher than 7. But let's get into the details.

So, let me calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. The concentration is 0.025 M, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So for the equivalence point, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH since it's a 1:1 reaction.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001
