Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

First, let's read the question carefully. The compound was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The data from each technique is given, and I need to match it to one of the four possible chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR usually indicate O-H stretching. The very broad one at 3000 suggests maybe an alcohol (like an -OH group) or possibly a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a very broad peak, it might be an O-H from a carboxylic acid because those tend to be broader due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, it could be an alcohol, but alcohol O-H is usually a bit less broad. Hmm.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. What functional groups show up around those regions? The 1700 region is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 cm⁻¹ could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like in a benzene ring with substituents) or maybe an amide or another carbonyl group in a different environment. Wait, but 1700 is a strong peak—like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring's C=C stretching.

Next, the 1H NMR shows several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those on a double bond, like in a CH2=CH group. So the compound must have a double bond, perhaps as part of an alkene or an aromatic ring. Wait, but if it's an aromatic ring, the protons would typically be split into multiple peaks, but vinyl protons could be in an alkene. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an alkene.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I'm trying to remember what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments include those from common functional groups. For example, the tropylium ion (from benzene rings) is at m/z 91, so that's probably not it. Methanol is 32, but that's not 45. Wait, 45 could be from a fragment like (CH3)2CO+ (acetone is 58, so maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps it's the (CH2)2O group? Wait, maybe the ethylene group. Wait, another thought: the fragment at m/z 45 could be a form of the C3H7O+ ion? Or perhaps a ketene group? Alternatively, maybe a fragment with a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider the molecular formulas given and see which could produce a fragment at m/z 45. Let me list the options:

Option A) C6H12O2. Molecular weight would be (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16) = 72 +12 +32 = 116 g/mol.

Option B) C6H10O. Molecular weight: 72 +10 +16 = 98.

Option C) C6H10O2. 72 +10 +32 = 114.

Option D) C6H12O. 72 +12 +16 = 100.

The mass spectrum shows a peak at m/z 45, which is about half of 90, which is the molecular weight of something like C3H6O. Wait, but let's think about possible fragments. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe the ester group could break into an acylium ion. Alternatively, a common fragment is the loss of a methyl group (15 m/z), but that's not it.

Wait, another possibility: when a molecule has an ester group (R-O-CO-O-R'), the mass spectrum might show a fragment where the ester group breaks, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. If the molecule has a ketone group, maybe a cleavage occurs. Let's think about the molecular formulas.

Suppose the formula is C6H10O2 (Option C). That could be something like methyl propionate or another ester. Or maybe a cyclic ester. Alternatively, for a molecule with both a carbonyl and an ester group.

Now, let's connect the NMR and IR data. The IR shows a broad peak around 3000, which suggests an O-H group. Let me think about possible structures. If the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, then the FTIR would have a very broad peak between 2500-3300, which fits. But then, another functional group's peak at 1700 could be a carbonyl from the acid. But wait, the question says two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch (broad) and a strong C=O around 1700. Then the 1650 might be an aromatic ring, but if there's an acid, maybe the molecule isn't aromatic. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or another functional group.

Wait, but if the compound has both a carboxylic acid group and an ester, that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone and a carboxylic acid. But let's think about the molecular formulas.

Option C is C6H10O2. That would have degrees of unsaturation: for C6H10O2, the formula is CnHmOp. The degree of unsaturation formula is (2n +2 -m -p)/2. So n=6, m=10, p=2.

So (2*6 +2 -10 -2)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2=1 degree. That would mean either one ring or one double bond or a combination. Wait, no, 1 degree would mean either one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc. Wait, no:

Wait, let me recalculate. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X (halogens) and N (nitrogen) are zero, so (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2 degrees. So two degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two rings, or two double bonds, etc.

Now, if the compound has a carbonyl group (which is a double bond), and maybe an aromatic ring (another double bond), but wait, benzene is three degrees of unsaturation. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, a ring plus a double bond.

But let's think about the NMR data. There are vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond (maybe an alkene). So that accounts for one degree. If the molecular formula has two degrees, the other could be a carbonyl group.

Let me think about possible structures. For example, a cyclic ester (lactone) would have an ester group and a ring. Or maybe a substituted cyclohexene with a carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a delta-lactone. For example, a five-membered ring with an ester linkage. That would have both an ester group (carbonyl) and a ring (another degree).

Alternatively, the compound could be an aromatic ester, but that might complicate things.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about possible ions that have a mass of 45. 45 is 45 g/mol. What could that be?

Possible fragments:

- C3H7O+ : 3*12 +7*1 +16= 36+7+16=59. No, that's 59.

Wait, another approach. 45 is 45, which is equal to 3*(12) + (3*1) + (16*0) = 45? No, wait, 3 carbons: 3*12=36, plus 3 hydrogens is 3, plus no oxygens—39. Not 45. Alternatively, if oxygen is present: 3 carbons and something else.

Wait, 45 g/mol: let's think about possible functional groups. For example, the tropylium ion is C7H7+ at m/z 91. Not helpful.

Wait, another thought: the fragment at 45 could be a CH2CH2O+ group? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe a ketene fragment? Or perhaps an aldehyde group breaking off.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, methyl group is 15, so that's not it.

Wait, what about a CH2CH2O group? That would be 48 (12*2 + 2 +16). No, that's 48, not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. The molecular weight of acetone is 58. But if it's a fragment, maybe a part of it. Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about possible molecular formulas and their possible fragments.

Let's take each option and see what fragment could lead to m/z 45.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molar mass is 116. Possible fragments: Maybe losing a large group and leaving a smaller one. Alternatively, think about the ester group. An ester could break into the acyl group and the alcohol part. For example, the ester R-O-CO-R' could cleave between the O and CO, leading to R-O+ and R'-CO+. But I'm not sure about the exact masses here.

Option B: C6H10O. Molar mass 98. Possible fragments could be lower, but 45 is possible.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molar mass 114. Maybe a fragment that's C3H6O2? No, that's 3*12 +6 +32= 36+6+32=74. Hmm, not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from an ester. For example, an ester group O-CO-O. If the ester breaks, perhaps the fragment could be the acyl group as an ion. For example, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then the fragment could be R-O-CO+ with mass depending on R.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketone group. Let's think: if the compound is something like an acetate ester. For example, methyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH3. The molecular formula is C4H8O2. Not matching any options here. So maybe a different structure.

Alternatively, considering the IR data: broad O-H (maybe a carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the structure would have -COOH. That would give a broad O-H peak in IR, and a strong C=O around 1700. Then, the 1650 peak could be from another group, perhaps an aromatic ring or another carbonyl. But if the compound is an aromatic acid, like benzoic acid, but the molecular formula is C6H12O2. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. So that's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a diacid? Like oxalic acid, but that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, something else.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is an ester and an alcohol. Or perhaps a hemiacetal.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. Let's think: a five-membered ring lactone would have the ester group within the ring. For example, gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2, which doesn't match our options.

Wait, but our options have six carbons. So maybe a six-membered ring with an ester group. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a β-propiolactone derivative—no, that's too small.

Wait, perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, but then the IR would show a strong peak for the aromatic ring. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 cm⁻¹ is an aromatic ring. So, benzene ring with substituents.

But let's think again about the functional groups. The FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. One is likely a carbonyl. The other... perhaps an aromatic ring or another carbonyl in conjugation.

Wait, if the compound has two carbonyl groups, the IR would show two strong peaks. So, for option C, C6H10O2, which has a degree of unsaturation of 2, that could mean two double bonds or rings. So maybe two carbonyl groups. For example, a cyclic anhydride. That would have two carbonyl groups. The IR would show two peaks around 1700 and maybe a bit lower if conjugated.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about the structure. Alternatively, maybe the compound is a diester or something with two ester groups. But that might not fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens. So the compound must have a double bond. So, perhaps a conjugated system with double bonds, like in an ester with an adjacent double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a substituted acyclic ester with a double bond. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But I'm not sure.

Now, going back to the mass spectrum. The fragment at m/z 45. Let me think of a possible fragment with that mass. Maybe a methyl group (15) plus something else. Alternatively, maybe a CH2O group. Wait, CH2O has a mass of 30 (12+2+16), so that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a group like CH2CH2O, which would be 48, but that's not 45.

Wait, maybe it's a propyl group attached to an oxygen. Propyl is C3H7, which is 51. Then, 51 plus something else, but that doesn't add up to 45.

Another approach: The molecular formula of the fragment is C3H7O. Let's calculate that: 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. Total 36+7+16=59. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe it's an ion with a formula like C3H3O. 3*12=36, 3=3, 16=16. 36+3+16=55. No. Or C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45. Oh wait, that's 24 +5 is 29, plus 16 is 45. Yes! So C2H5O would have a molecular weight of 45.

So the fragment is C2H5O+. That would mean a -O-C2H5 group or something similar. So the molecule might have an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3). Because when the molecule breaks, the ethoxy group could form a fragment with the O, giving m/z 45.

Wait, but OCH2CH3 would be C2H5O, which is 2*(12) +5*(1) +16 =24+5+16=45. Yes, that's exactly it. So the mass fragment at m/z45 is likely the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) as a fragment.

Which options have an ethoxy group? Well, the presence of an ethoxy group would suggest an ester or an ether. Looking at the molecular formulas, which ones can have an ethoxy group?

Let's see: an ethoxy group is C2H5O. So the main molecule would have that as part of its structure. Let's see each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. If part of it is OCH2CH3 (ethoxy), that would contribute 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and one oxygen. The remaining would be C4H7O. Hmm, possible.

But wait, the way molecular formulas work, the entire formula should add up. Let's take Option C: C6H10O2. If the fragment is OCH2CH3 (which is C2H5O), then the main molecule would have (6-2)=4 C, (10-5)=5 H, and (2-1)=1 O. Wait, but OCH2CH3 is part of the molecule, which contributes 2 C, 5 H, and 1 O. So the remaining would be C4H5O. But the total O in the molecule is 2. So maybe the other O is in a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but for the mass fragment, it's when the molecule breaks, forming OCH2CH3+ (m/z45). So the original molecule must have an ethoxy group.

Looking back, which options include an ethoxy group. Let's think: if the molecule is an ester, it would have the structure R-O-CO-R'. If R' is CH3, then the ester would be R-O-CO-CH3. Alternatively, if R is ethyl, then R' would be something else.

Wait, let me think about the options. Let's take option C: C6H10O2.

If the structure is an ester, say ethyl something. So the ester would be O-CO-O. So, the formula would be (R-O-CO-R') where R is ethyl (C2H5) and R' is another group. Let's see.

If R is ethyl (C2H5) and R' is a propyl group, but wait, the overall formula would be C2H5-O-CO-R'. Let's see, R' would have to be C3H5O (since the total is C6H10O2; subtracting the ethyl (C2H5) and the ester group (O and CO), we'd have R' as C3H5O. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, a lactone with an ethoxy group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid. For example, ethyl propionate is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula for that would be C4H8O2. But that doesn't match any of the given options. So perhaps the molecule is a larger ester.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is something like methyl acrylate, but that's C4H6O2, which again doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate. But that's C8H8O2, which is not one of the options.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the overall data again.

IR: Broad peak at 3000 (O-H), 1700 (C=O), and 1650 (possibly another C=O or aromatic ring).

NMR: Vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond.

Mass: Fragment at 45 (OCH2CH3).

So, the molecule likely has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) and a carbonyl group. So, perhaps it's an ester with an ethoxy group and a double bond.

Looking at the options:

Option C is C6H10O2. Let's see: If the formula is C6H10O2, and we have an ethoxy group (C2H5O), then the remaining would be C4H5O. Hmm, which would need to have a carbonyl group and a double bond.

Wait, C4H5O could be a structure like CH2CH2COOH, but that's not fitting. Alternatively, a ketone or aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps the remaining part is a propenoate or similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is an ethyl acrylate. Acrylic acid is CH2=CHCOOH. The ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula for that would be C5H8O2. But our options have six carbons, so perhaps it's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is ethyl something with a double bond. For example, ethyl 3-pentenoate would be CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. The formula would be C7H10O2. That's more than six carbons.

Hmm. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternative approach: Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2*6 + 2 -12 -2)/2 = (14-14)/2=0. So all single bonds, no rings. But this can't be right because we have a double bond (from vinyl H) and a carbonyl. So DoU should be 3 (one ring and two double bonds, or three double bonds).

Wait, wait, the formula for DoU is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Without X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

So for option A: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation. That can be one ring or one double bond. But we have a vinyl group (double bond) and a carbonyl (another double bond). So that would need two degrees. So option A can't be right.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Possible: two double bonds, or a ring and a double bond.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(14-10)/2=2. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(14-12)/2=1. So one degree. Can't account for two double bonds (from IR and NMR).

So options B and C have two degrees, which could fit.

Now, the IR data: two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and something else.

If it's two carbonyl groups, then the DoU would account for two (each C=O is a double bond). But that would require four degrees of unsaturation (each C=O is a double bond). Wait, no, each C=O is one degree.

Wait, each double bond or ring contributes one DoU. So two C=O groups would contribute two DoU. Which would fit options B and C, which have two DoU.

So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups. But wait, that would require the molecule to have two of them, like an anhydride or a diketone.

But looking back, the IR peaks are at 1700 and 1650, which are both in the carbonyl region. So maybe two carbonyls.

But wait, the options C and B have two DoU. So for C, the two DoU could be two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, one carbonyl and an aromatic ring. But an aromatic ring contributes three DoU (three double bonds in benzene). So that would make it four DoU in total, which the options don't have.

So perhaps two carbonyl groups. So the compound would have two C=O groups.

So let's think about the possible structures. For example, a cyclic anhydride or a compound with two ester groups.

But let's connect this with the mass spec. The fragment at 45 is OCH2CH3, so the ethoxy group.

So the molecule must have an ethoxy group. So it's likely an ester.

Wait, but if it's an ester, it would have one carbonyl group. So how do we get two carbonyl peaks in IR? Unless it's something else.

Wait, alternative idea: The two carbonyl peaks could be from an ester and a ketone, or an ester and an aromatic ring (but that's unlikely because aromatic rings don't show as strong peaks in that region). Alternatively, maybe an ester and a conjugated carbonyl.

Alternatively, maybe one is an ester (around 1700) and another is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which would have a carbonyl peak at a lower wavenumber, like 1650.

Ah, that makes sense. So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, it would have a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl. The conjugation would lower the C=O stretching frequency, so the peak would be at around 1650 instead of 1700. So the 1700 peak would be from another carbonyl group, perhaps another ester or a ketone.

Wait, but if the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, then the IR would show the C=O at around 1650 (lower than usual due to conjugation), and another carbonyl elsewhere, but that doesn't fit the data because the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. Alternatively, perhaps one is an ester (1700) and the other is an aromatic ring (1650). But that would require three DoU, which the options don't have.

Wait, another thought: the 1650 peak could be an aromatic ring. But that would require three DoU, which isn't possible here. So perhaps the 1650 is another carbonyl, but in a different environment.

Alternatively, the 1650 could be from an amide, but that's probably not the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try to summarize:

- O-H (broad at 3000): likely a carboxylic acid or an alcohol or ester's O-H.

Wait, but esters don't have O-H groups. Wait, no, the O-H in the IR is broad, which suggests it's a hydroxyl group. Esters don't have free -OH groups. So if the IR shows a broad peak, it's likely a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, wait, in an ester, the O is connected to an R group, so no free -OH. So the broad peak suggests a hydroxyl group like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have -COOH. So the IR would have a very broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, which matches the 3000 peak. Then, the 1700 peak would be the C=O of the acid. The 1650 peak could be from another carbonyl group, but that seems unlikely because a carboxylic acid would have only one C=O.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol with another carbonyl group. For example, a ketone and an alcohol. But the IR would then show the broad O-H (alcohol) and a C=O (ketone) at around 1700.

So in that case, the IR data would fit a compound with an alcohol group and a ketone. The NMR would have vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond. The mass spec would have a fragment at 45, which could be from an ethoxy group.

Wait, but if it's an alcohol and a ketone, how would that fit the molecular formulas?

For example, a cyclic ketone with an alcohol group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, it's a secondary alcohol with a ketone group.

But let's think about the molecular formula. Let's take option C: C6H10O2.

If it's a diol, but that would have two O-H groups. But the IR shows a broad peak, which could be from a single -OH group, so maybe a hemiacetal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a β-keto acid, which has both a ketone and a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), but that would have the formula C4H6O3. Not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted ester with an alcohol group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a fragment at m/z 45 suggests an ethoxy group. So the compound likely has an ethoxy group. So it's either an ester (RCOOR') where R' is ethyl, or an ether (R-O-R') where one R is ethyl.

If it's an ester, then the molecule would have a carbonyl group, which matches the IR data. If it's an ether, there would be no carbonyl, which doesn't fit the IR data (since the IR shows a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹, indicating a carbonyl group).

So it must be an ester. So the structure is RCOOR', where R' is ethyl.

Thus, the formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. Let's calculate the formula:

R is (C6H10O2 - C2H5O2) ?

Wait, no. The molecular formula is RCOOCH2CH3, so R would be (C6H10O2) - (C2H5O2) ) ? Wait, no. Let's calculate:

The ester is RCOOCH2CH3. The formula is (R)COO(C2H5). The overall formula would be C(n+2) H(2m+5) O2. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, let's take the molecular formula of the ester. Let's say R is C4H7O. Then, RCOOCH2CH3 would be C5H10O2. But the options have C6H10O2. So maybe R is C3H5O. Then, RCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, a lactone. For example, a six-membered ring lactone would have the formula C6H10O2. That matches option C.

A six-membered ring lactone would have the structure where the ester is part of a ring. So, it would have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester linkage. So the IR would show a strong peak at around 1700 for the C=O.

The NMR would show protons adjacent to the carbonyl group. If the ring has a double bond, the vinyl protons would appear as a peak in the NMR, which aligns with the data.

In the mass spectrum, the fragment at m/z 45 would correspond to the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) if the lactone ring breaks in a certain way. Hmm, but a lactone doesn't have an ethoxy group. Wait, unless the lactone is a gamma-lactone or delta-lactone.

Wait, in a gamma-lactone (five-membered ring), the ester is between the carbonyl oxygen and an oxygen two carbons away. So, the structure would be something like:

O
||
O-C-O
      |
      CH2CH2CH2

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the gamma-lactone would have four members in the ring, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let's think about the mass spectrum. If the fragment is OCH2CH3 (45), perhaps the molecule has an ethyl group connected to an oxygen, as in an ester.

So, the compound is an ester with an ethoxy group. So, the formula would be RCOOCH2CH3. Let's calculate the formula:

RCOOCH2CH3 = RCOOEt. The formula of RCOOEt is (R)COO(C2H5). So, R would be (C6H10O2) minus (C3H5O2), which would leave R as C3H5O. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is ethyl propionate, which is CH3CH2COOCH2CH3. The formula is C5H10O2. But our options have C6H10O2, so that's one carbon too short.

Hmm. This is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to re-examine the options.

Option C is C6H10O2. The possible structures include esters, anhydrides, amides, ketones, etc.

Given the IR data, the presence of a carbonyl and a possible ethoxy group, and a vinyl group, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's check the formula:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3 is C5H8O2. But our options are C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is ethyl 4-pentenoate: CH2CH2CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: COO is two, ethyl is two, and the four carbons from the pentenoate. So that's 2+2+4=8. No, that's more than six.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is ethyl acrylate, which is C4H6O2. Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible structures for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structures include:

- An ester with a carbonyl and an ethoxy group, plus a double bond.

For example, ethyl 3-pentenoate would be CH2CHCH2COOCH2CH3. The formula is C7H10O2. No, that's seven carbons. So perhaps a six-membered ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a gamma-lactone with five members. The formula for gamma-butyrolactone is C4H6O2, which doesn't match.

Wait, another structure could be a substituted cyclopentene with an ester group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diester. But that would require more oxygen.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formula. The options are C6H10O2, C6H10O, etc.

If the compound has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), then the rest of the molecule would be C4H7O. Because the total is C6H10O2, subtracting the OCH2CH3 (C2H5O) gives C4H5O.

Wait, but C4H5O would have a formula of C4H5O. That's not a typical structure. Maybe it's a ketone, like (CH3)2CO (acetone, which is C3H6O), but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the remaining part is a propenoic acid: CH2=CHCOOH. That's C3H4O2. Adding the ethoxy group (C2H5O) would give C5H9O3, which doesn't match.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should think about the options again.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation 1. So one double bond or ring. But we have a vinyl group (double bond), and a carbonyl (another double bond). That requires two degrees, so option A can't be right.

Option B: C6H10O. Degrees of Unsaturation 2. Could have two double bonds or a ring and a double bond. But without oxygen beyond the ethoxy, perhaps, but the IR suggests a carbonyl group, which would require an oxygen, so maybe not.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of Unsaturation 2. Could have two double bonds or a ring and a double bond. Fits with a carbonyl and a vinyl group.

Option D: C6H12O. Degrees of Unsaturation 1. Can't fit the two double bonds needed.

So the only plausible options are B and C.

Wait, but option B is C6H10O, which has O but not enough for two functional groups (like O-H and C=O), but wait, the IR has two strong peaks. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. So, two carbonyl groups. But option B has only one O in the formula. So that's not possible. Because each carbonyl requires an O. So option B is C6H10O, which can only have one O-containing group, like a ketone or an alcohol. So the IR data, which shows two strong peaks in the carbonyl region, can't be explained by option B. So option B is out.

So, only option C or A. Wait, earlier I thought option A couldn't fit because it has only one degree of unsaturation, but let me recheck.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of Unsaturation 1. So one double bond or ring. But we have a vinyl group (double bond) and a carbonyl (another double bond), which would require two degrees. So option A can't have both, so it's not the right choice.

Therefore, the correct option must be C: C6H10O2.

So, putting it all together:

- IR: O-H (broad, carboxylic acid or alcohol), C=O at 1700 and 1650 (could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, where the conjugated C=O is at 1650 and another carbonyl at 1700).

- NMR: vinyl H, so a double bond.

- Mass: fragment at 45, likely OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group).

So the structure is likely an ester with an ethoxy group and a conjugated double bond, fitting C6H10O2.


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the given spectroscopic data and match it to one of the molecular formulas: **C₆H₁₂O₂**, **C₆H₁₀O**, **C₆H₁₀O₂**, or **C₆H₁₂O**.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **FTIR Data**:
   - A broad absorption peak at **3000 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.
   - Strong absorption peaks at **1700 cm⁻¹** and **1650 cm⁻¹** indicate the presence of carbonyl groups. The peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of a C=O stretch, while the peak at 1650 cm⁻¹ could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or a carbonyl in a different environment.

2. **¹H NMR Data**:
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens indicate the presence of a double bond (alkene or aromatic).

3. **Mass Spectrometry Data**:
   - A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of an ethoxy group (C₂H₅O), as this fragment matches the molecular weight of an ethoxy ion.

4. **Molecular Formula Analysis**:
   - **C₆H₁₂O₂**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This is insufficient to account for both the vinyl group (double bond) and the carbonyl group (another double bond), so this option is eliminated.
   - **C₆H₁₀O**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. However, this formula contains only one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the two carbonyl peaks observed in the IR spectrum. This option is also eliminated.
   - **C₆H₁₀O₂**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 2. This formula is consistent with the presence of two carbonyl groups (e.g., an ester and a conjugated carbonyl) and a vinyl group. Additionally, the ethoxy group (C₂H₅O) matches the fragment peak at m/z = 45.
   - **C₆H₁₂O**: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = 1. Similar to **C₆H₁₂O₂**, this formula cannot account for the two double bonds required by the IR and NMR data. This option is eliminated.

### Conclusion:
The spectroscopic data, including the IR peaks, NMR signals, and mass spectrometry fragment, are best explained by the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**. This formula accounts for the broad O-H peak, the two carbonyl groups, the vinyl hydrogens, and the ethoxy fragment in the mass spectrum.
