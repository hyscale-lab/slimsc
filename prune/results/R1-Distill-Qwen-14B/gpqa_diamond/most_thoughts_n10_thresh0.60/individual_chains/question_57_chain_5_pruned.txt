Alright, so I've got this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons, and I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

I remember that in scattering experiments, especially in nuclear physics, the scattering amplitude is described using partial waves and phase shifts. The general form of the scattering amplitude, I think, is given by a sum over all the angular momentum states. Oh right, the formula involves the Legendre polynomials and the phase shifts.

Wait, the question gives me the phase shifts for different l values. Let me see: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. And they say to ignore the rest, so I guess l=0 to 4 are the ones considered.

The scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is given by:
f(θ, φ) = ∑ [ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l / (k r) ] * P_l(cosθ) e^{i φ l} 

Wait, but the question is specifically asking for the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, when the scattering angle θ is 0 degrees, because that's along the incident direction. So θ = 0.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think. The incident beam direction is the initial direction of the particles, so the scattering angle is 180 degrees if it's backscattering. Oh no, wait, no, no. Wait, θ is the angle between the initial direction and the final direction. So along the beam direction, θ would be 0 degrees. Because that's when the scattered particle is moving in the same direction as the incident beam. Or wait, no, when they're opposite, that's 180. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, in scattering experiments, θ is the angle between the initial direction (incident beam) and the direction of the scattered particle. So when θ is 0, the particle is moving in the same direction. But that's probably not where the maximum happens. Anyway, the problem says along the incident beam direction, so I think I should evaluate the amplitude at θ=0.

Wait, but maybe the phase shifts and the amplitude depend on the angle. Hmm, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude
