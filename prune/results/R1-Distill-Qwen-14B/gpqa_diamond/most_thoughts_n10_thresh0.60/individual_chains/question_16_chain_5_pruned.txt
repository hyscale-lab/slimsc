Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? Which usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center or some kind of stereoisomerism that can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Let me go through each compound one by one to see which ones are chiral or have other forms of asymmetry.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Wait, the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, but the double bond is at position 1-ene, so it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the substituents would be Cl and CH2CH2? Hmm, not sure
