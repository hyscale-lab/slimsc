Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that scattering amplitude involves something called partial waves and phase shifts. Let me try to piece this together.

The question gives me several phase shifts: delta_o is 90 degrees, delta_1 is 67, delta_2 is 55, delta_3 is 30, and delta_4 is 13 degrees. The rest are ignored. Oh right, phase shifts are important in calculating the scattering amplitude. And the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? I think it's something like f(theta) = sum of these terms involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the general formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is f(l) = (1/(k i)) * sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l) ) * P_l(cos(theta)) ), where k is the wave number, and P_l are Legendre polynomials.

But wait, the problem says to calculate the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, that's when theta is zero. Because the incident direction is along theta=0. So we need f(0) for the incident beam direction.

Looking at the formula, when theta is 0, what's P_l(1)? Because cos(0) is 1. Oh yeah, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the sum simplifies a bit because each P_l is 1. So f(0) would be (1/(k i)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) exp(i delta_l) sin(delta_l) ) * 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The amplitude f is given by f(theta) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l+1) [sin(delta_l) / k ] ) * [ e^{2i delta_l} - 1 ] / (2i) ) * P_l(cos(theta)) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some steps. Another approach: The partial wave expansion of the scattering amplitude is f(theta) = sum_{l=0}^\infty ( (2l + 1)/(2i) ) ( e^{2i delta_l} - 1 ) P_l(cos theta) ) / k.

Alternatively, I think the formula is f
