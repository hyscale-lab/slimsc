Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that the Hamiltonian operator is H = ε σ · n, where n is a unit vector, ε is an energy constant, and σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. They're asking for the eigenvalues of H.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are used in the context of spin-½ particles. Each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 matrix, right? And when you take their dot product with a vector, you get another operator. The eigenvalues of such an operator must be related to the possible spin states.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The dot product σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

I'm trying to recall the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices themselves. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you have them multiplied by coefficients and summed, like in σ · n, the eigenvalues might change.

So the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix because it's made from Pauli matrices. To find the eigenvalues, I can think about the general form of such matrices. Alternatively, maybe I can find the trace and determinant and use them to find eigenvalues.

The trace of H would be the sum of the diagonal elements. Let's see, the trace of σ · n would be Tr(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). But wait, each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero. So Tr(σ_x) = 0, same for σ_y and σ_z. So the trace of H is zero.

The determinant of H is a bit trickier. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix A = [[a, b], [c, d]] is ad - bc. For Pauli matrices, each has a determinant of -1. But when you have a sum, like a linear combination, the determinant isn't straightforward. Or maybe I should think about the properties of σ · n.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator like H (since it's an observable) are real. H is Hermitian because σ · n is, since each Pauli matrix is Hermitian and n is a real vector.

The
