Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the Bubble Chamber at CERN. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what do I know about this? Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So I think I need to calculate the Lorentz gamma factor here.

The formula for gamma is gamma = E / m, but wait, E here is the total energy, which is the relativistic energy. But wait, does that hold? Because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so E = gamma m c². So gamma would be E/(m c²). But since the units are in GeV, maybe I can ignore the c² and just do E/m? Because the c² would cancel out when I take E/(m c²) since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c². Wait, maybe I should think about units.

Wait, the energy E is given as 27 GeV. The mass m is 3.41 GeV, but I guess that's GeV/c². So the energy E is probably the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic.

So gamma = E / (m c²). Hmm, but in natural units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma = E / m. So in this case, gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = approximately 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, so 27 is 3.41 * 7.92, approximately, so gamma is about 7.92.

Wait, let me do it more accurately: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 - 23.87
