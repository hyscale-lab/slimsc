Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about enamine reactions, which I remember are a type of reaction involving amines and carbonyl compounds. Enamines are usually formed by condensing secondary amines with carbonyls. They're useful because they can undergo various reactions that are otherwise difficult with regular ketones or aldehydes.

The question is about a reaction starting with (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. I need to figure out what product B is and the correct sequence of reagents A. The question gives four options, A to D, each with different reagents and products.

Let me break down what I know about enamine reactions. Enamines are typically formed in two steps. First, an aldehyde or ketone reacts with a secondary amine to form a Schiff base, which is then usually dehydrated to form the enamine. The general structure of an enamine is R2N-CR2, where the double bond is between the N and the adjacent carbon.

But wait, the starting material here is an enaminium salt. I think enaminium refers to an enamine that's protonated, which makes it more electrophilic. So maybe this is a case where the enamine is going to undergo some kind of reaction, like a Michael addition or some type of alkylation.

Looking at the starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me draw that structure. So, the ethanaminium part is CH2NH3+ something. Then, the N is attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group. Pentan-2-ylidene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 but wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond? Wait, no, the ylidene group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond starting at position 2. So perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2- but wait, the substituent is pentan-2-ylidene, so the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, maybe better to
