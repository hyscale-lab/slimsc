Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity... right, that's when you look for Doppler shifts in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble.

So, the problem says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The data given is about the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. For Planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms (I think that's 5e-3 angstroms), and for Planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but wait, the question is about the orbital periods. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1.

I remember that the radial velocity method depends on the mass of the planet and its distance from the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3), but wait that's getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of the relation between K, the orbital period, and the mass.

Alternatively, I recall that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star. Oh, and since both stars have the same mass, and the planets are similar to Neptune, their masses are the same too. So M_p1 = M_p2.

Wait, but in the RV method, the formula for K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) * (P/(2π))^(−1/3). But since M_p is much less than M_star, the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximately 1. So K is approximately proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (P^(-1/3)).

So
