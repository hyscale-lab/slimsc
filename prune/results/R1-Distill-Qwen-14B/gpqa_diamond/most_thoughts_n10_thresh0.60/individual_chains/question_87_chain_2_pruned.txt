Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR question. Let me read it again. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. So, wait, a benzene ring has 6 carbons, right? So the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8. So each substituent probably has one carbon each, making it a 1,2-disubstituted benzene? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? Wait, no, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

The IR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, one substituent is a carbonyl, and another is a halogen. Wait, but wait, halogens are usually X (like Cl, Br) attached to the ring. But wait, the carbonyl could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. So the substituents are a halogen and a carbonyl group.

Wait, but the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add two carbons. So each substituent is a group with one carbon. Hmm, or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group with two carbons, but that might complicate things. Wait, let's think: for example, if one substituent is a -OCH3 (methoxy), that's another carbon, but that's not a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl, like a ketone (e.g., -CO-R), but that could add more carbons.

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. Benzene (6) plus substituents (2), so the substituents together are two carbons. So each substituent is one carbon. So, for example, one substituent is a carbonyl group attached as a ketone, like a carbonyl group (e.g., -CO-) but wait, that would require more carbons. Hmm, perhaps each substituent is a halogen and a carbonyl group with one carbon each. Wait, but carbonyl groups like -COH might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a halogen and a -CHO group. Because -CHO is an aldehyde, which has a carbonyl (
