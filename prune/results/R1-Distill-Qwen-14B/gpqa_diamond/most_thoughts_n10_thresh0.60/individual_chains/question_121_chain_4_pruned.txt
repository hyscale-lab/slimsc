Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because epoxide reactions with organocuprates aren't something I'm super confident about. But let's try to think it through.

The question is about reacting a specific epoxide with Me2CuLi. The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to figure out what product forms and choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I remember that organocuprates, like Me2CuLi, are strong nucleophiles and they typically open epoxide rings. Epoxides are strained three-membered rings, so they tend to react easily under nucleophilic attack. The key here is understanding where the nucleophile (the methyl group from the cuprate) will attack and how the stereochemistry will change.

The question states that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. Also, in disubstituted epoxides, there's an inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile adds. Wait, wait, I should clarify: the inversion is at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. So, if the epoxide has two substituents (disubstituted), the attacking carbon will have inversion. 

Looking at the starting structure: (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. The bicyclo notation can be tricky. Bicyclo[m.n.p] refers to the number of carbons in each bridge. [4.1.0] means two bridges, one with 4 carbons, another with 1, and the third with 0. Wait, no, the bicyclo notation is bicyclo[x.y.z], where x is the number of carbons between the two bridgeheads, y the next, etc. So for [4.1.0], the bridgehead is at positions 1 and 6, perhaps. Hmm, maybe I should draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the structure. The compound is a bicyclo structure with an epoxide oxygen at position 7. So, the 7-oxabicyclo suggests
