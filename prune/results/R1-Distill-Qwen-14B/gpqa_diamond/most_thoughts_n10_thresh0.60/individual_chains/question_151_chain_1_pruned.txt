Okay, so I need to calculate the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Wait, the system's state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is usually a unit vector, right? So the first thing I should check is whether this state is normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of its components.

So the state vector is (-1, 2, 1) as a column. The sum would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2. That's 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, wait, that's 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So to make it a unit vector, each component should be divided by sqrt(6). But since the observable's expectation is based on the inner product, maybe I don't need to normalize it first. Wait, because when you calculate probabilities, you take the inner product, which includes the norms of the state and the eigenvectors. Hmm, maybe I should proceed without worrying about that.

The observable P is given as a matrix. Let me write it down. First row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So it's a 3x3 matrix.

To find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, the probability is the square of the amplitude of the state vector in that eigenvector's direction.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of an observable are its eigenvalues. So first, I should find the eigenvalues of matrix P. Because the question is about the probability of getting 0, I need to check if 0 is an eigenvalue. So let's find the eigenvalues.

The matrix P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Row 2: [1/√2, 0, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, 0]

Hmm, I can try to find the determinant of (P - λ I), where I is the identity matrix, and set it to zero for
