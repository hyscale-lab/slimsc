Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a certain potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are all expressions involving some combination of quantum numbers and some terms with ℏ, sqrt(k/m), etc.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, we often look for separable solutions, like in the hydrogen atom or the harmonic oscillator. The potential here seems to depend on both r and θ, so maybe it's useful to switch to polar coordinates because the particle is moving in two dimensions.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor that a bit. So, V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, so that's a function of r and θ. Now, I wonder if this can be written in terms of some angular part and a radial part.

Wait, another approach: Could this potential be separable into radial and angular parts? Because that would allow us to solve the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates, which should help in finding the energy levels.

Let me think: For a central potential, the solution often separates into radial and angular parts because the Hamiltonian is separable. But wait, this potential isn't purely radial because of the cos²θ
