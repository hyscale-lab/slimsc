Alright, let's tackle this physics problem. So, the question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay has something to do with their lifetimes or lifespans. I think the mean decay distance is related to how far they travel before decaying, which depends on their lifetime and their velocity.

The given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Oh wait, I should make sure all the units are consistent. So, 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. Right, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV.

I remember that the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here, right? The natural linewidth is given by Γ ≈ ħ/τ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So, τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, I should double-check the exact formula. I think the formula is τ = ħ/(Γ), yes.

Once I have the lifetime τ, the next step is to find out how far the meson travels before decaying. That distance would be the velocity multiplied by the lifetime, L = v * τ. But wait, what's the velocity? Since the meson is moving at relativistic speeds, I can't just use v = c (speed of light) directly. Oh no, wait, because the meson's speed would be a significant fraction of the speed of light, but maybe I can approximate it as c for this calculation. Hmm, but I might need to calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first find the meson's energy and then calculate its velocity using relativistic mechanics. Let's think about that. The meson has energy E_X = 8 GeV, and its rest mass m_X = 1.2 GeV. So, the relativistic energy is E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So, γ = E/(m c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2. Let me calculate that: 8 divided by 1.2 is approximately 6.666... So γ is about 6.6667.

Now, the velocity v can be found using the relation for relativistic velocities. I remember that γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So, solving for v, we have v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)). Let me compute that.

First, compute 1/γ². γ is 6.6667, so γ squared is (6.6667)^2 = about 44.444. So 1/γ² is 1/44.444, which is approximately 0.0225. Then 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887, which is about 0.9887c. That's pretty close to the speed of light. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe I can approximate v as c? Wait, but using v ≈ c would introduce some error. Maybe it's better to use the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to approximate it as c. Hmm.

Wait, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. So I need to compute both v and τ.

Let me first compute τ. The width Γ is given as 0.32 GeV. So, using τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure the units are correct.

ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, is that right? Let me think. Planck constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. Since 1 GeV is 1.602 × 10^-10 J, so ħ in GeV·s is h/(2π) converted into GeV·s. Let me calculate that.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s. 1 GeV = 1.602e-10 J. So h in GeV·s is h (J·s) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = (6.626e-34)/(1.602e-10) ) GeV·s. Let's compute that:

6.626e-34 / 1.602e-10 = approx 4.137e-24 GeV·s.

Then ħ is h/(2π), so divide this by 2π (~6.283). So 4.137e-24 / 6.283 ≈ 6.58e-25 GeV·s. So, yes, ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s.

Calculating that: 6.582 / 0.32 ≈ 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, no, wait. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So τ is roughly 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Next, find v. Earlier, I found that v ≈ 0.9887c, which is roughly 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s. Let me compute that: 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Alternatively, using v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/γ²). Wait, let me compute it accurately.

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So γ squared is (6.6666667)^2 = 44.444444.

So 1/γ² is 1/44.444444 ≈ 0.0225.

1 - 1/γ² = 0.9775.

The square root of 0.9775 is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887.

So v = c * 0.9887 ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.9661e8 m/s.

So, now the mean decay distance L = v * τ.

v is approximately 2.9661e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiplying them together gives L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Calculating that: 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let me compute that:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375.

0.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ approximately 2.003.

So total is approximately 4.11375 + 2.003 = 6.11675. So, 6.11675e-16 meters.

Wait, wait. Because 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (2.9661 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (about 6.11) * 1e-16 m.

So, L ≈ 6.11e-16 meters?

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in the 1e-15 to 1e-16 m range. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the velocity as exactly c? Let's try that. If I approximate v as c = 3e8 m/s.

Then L = c * τ = 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 6.170625e-16 m.

Hmm, that's about 6.17e-16 m. But none of the options match that. The options are around 4e-15, 5e-15, 4e-16, etc.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of tau. Let me recheck.

Tau is ħ / Γ. So ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / (0.32) seconds.

6.582e-25 divided by 0.32: 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the velocity more accurately. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

Gamma = E/(m c^2) → but since E and m are given in GeV and GeV/c², perhaps the c² cancels out. So gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6666667.

So beta is v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So beta squared = 1 - 1/(gamma^2) = 1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) = 1 - ( (1.2/8)^2 ) = 1 - (0.15)^2 = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that more accurately.

What's the square root of 0.9775?

Let me compute it:

0.9887^2 = let's see:

0.9887 * 0.9887: 0.98^2 is 0.9604. 0.98*0.0087 = 0.008526. So 0.98*0.9887 ≈ 0.9697. Wait, perhaps a better way.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Let me check 0.9887^2:

0.9887 * 0.9887: 

= (0.98 + 0.0087)^2

= 0.98^2 + 2*(0.98)(0.0087) + (0.0087)^2

= 0.9604 + 2*(0.008526) + 0.00007569

= 0.9604 + 0.017052 + 0.00007569 ≈ 0.97752769.

Which is very close to 0.9775, so beta is approximately 0.9887. So v = 0.9887c.

So, v is about 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

So, L = v * tau = 2.9661e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply 2.9661e8 * 2.056875e-24:

The exponents: 1e8 * 1e-24 = 1e-16.

Now the coefficients: 2.9661 * 2.056875 ≈ let's compute precisely.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322.

2.9661 * 0.056875 = ?

0.05 * 2.9661 = 0.148305.

0.006875 * 2.9661 = approx 0.02038.

Adding those: 0.148305 + 0.02038 = 0.168685.

So total is 5.9322 + 0.168685 = 6.100885.

So L ≈ 6.100885e-16 m.

Hmm, but none of the options are close to 6e-16 m. The options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B) 4.0655e-15 m

C) 5.0223e-15 m

D) 4.0655e-16 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should have used a different approach. Oh! Wait a second. I think I might have confused the formula for the mean decay length. Let me think. The mean decay length is given by L = c * tau * beta * gamma. Hmm, no, wait. Because the lifetime is in the particle's rest frame, and when you boost to the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So the lifetime in the lab frame is tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest.

Wait, no. In the rest frame, the lifetime is tau. From the lab frame (where the particle is moving), the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime observed in the lab is gamma * tau.

So the decay length is L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, that changes things. So earlier, I used v * tau, but that's not considering the time dilation. So to correct that, L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, let me rederive this.

In the rest frame of the meson, the lifetime is tau. So the distance it travels in its own frame is zero because it's not moving. But in the lab frame, which sees the meson moving at velocity v, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation: tau_lab = gamma * tau.

So the decay length is L = v * tau_lab = v * gamma * tau.

So, in that case, I should have multiplied by gamma as well.

Hmm, that's a crucial point I might have missed earlier. So earlier, I had v and tau, but I forgot to multiply by gamma. So let me recompute using this correction.

So, tau is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

v is 0.9887c.

gamma is 6.6666667.

So, L = v * gamma * tau.

So v is 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

gamma is 6.6666667.

So, L = 2.9661e8 m/s * 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 2.9661e8 * 6.6666667.

2.9661e8 * 6.6666667 ≈ 2.9661e8 * (20/3) ≈ 2.9661e8 * 6.6666667.

Let me compute 2.9661 * 6.6666667:

2.9661 * 6 = 17.7966.

2.9661 * 0.6666667 ≈ approx 1.9774.

Total is approximately 19.774.

So 19.774e8 = 1.9774e9 m/s.

Now, multiply this by tau, which is 2.056875e-24 s.

So 1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

The exponents: 1e9 * 1e-24 = 1e-15.

Coefficient: 1.9774 * 2.056875 ≈ let's calculate it.

1.9774 * 2 = 3.9548.

1.9774 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.1123.

Adding them gives 3.9548 + 0.1123 = 4.0671.

So L ≈ 4.0671e-15 meters.

Wait, that's approximately 4.067e-15 m. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. Option D is 4.0655e-16 m, which is an order of magnitude smaller.

So the correct answer would be option B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations for any errors.

Wait, let me redo the gamma multiplication step.

L = v * gamma * tau.

v = 0.9887c = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = 2.9661e8 m/s.

Gamma is 6.6666667.

So v * gamma = 2.9661e8 * 6.6666667.

Calculate 2.9661 * 6.6666667:

Let me compute 2.9661 * 6 = 17.7966.

2.9661 * 0.6666667: 0.6666667 is 2/3.

2.9661 * 2 = 5.9322; divided by 3 is approx 1.9774.

So total is 17.7966 + 1.9774 = 19.774.

So 19.774e8 m/s.

Wait, no: 2.9661e8 m/s multiplied by 6.6666667 is 2.9661e8 * 6.6666667 = (2.9661 * 6.6666667) * 1e8.

Which is 19.774 * 1e8 = 1.9774e9 m/s.

Then multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

1.9774e9 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = (1.9774 * 2.056875) * 1e9 * 1e-24 = (4.067) * 1e-15 m.

So L ≈ 4.067e-15 m.

Which matches option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. That's very close.

So the correct answer must be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance \( L \) of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

where \( \tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau \) is the lifetime in the lab frame, \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \) is the lifetime in the rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the meson. The given parameters are:

- \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is related to \( \gamma \) by:

\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):

\[
v = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = c \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{44.4444}} = c \cdot \sqrt{0.9775} \approx c \cdot 0.9887
\]

Thus:

\[
v \approx 0.9887 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the rest-frame lifetime \( \tau \)
The rest-frame lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the width \( \Gamma \) by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the lab-frame lifetime \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \)
The lab-frame lifetime is:

\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:

\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.9661 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 2.9661 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{m} \approx 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
The mean decay distance is approximately \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \), which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
