Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out which planet has a higher chance of transiting, so the researchers should pick that one to observe.

Let me start by recalling what I know about transits. A transit happens when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

Wait, right, the probability of transit is given by (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by some other factors? Or maybe it's more about the geometry. Oh, right! The probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the size of the star's orbit. But wait, no, perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula is something like (R_*/a) * (something else), but I'm a bit fuzzy. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the area that the planet covers relative to the star's disk. But more accurately, the probability depends on the impact parameter. Alternatively, the geometric probability is given by (R_* / a) * (1 + (R_p / R_*)), but since R_p is much smaller, it's approximately (R_* / a).

Wait, no, the geometric probability is actually (R_*
