Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question has two parts, two reactions. I need to figure out which reagents (A and B) are suitable for each step. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations.

First reaction: Butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's acetone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that in the presence of a ketone and a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition reaction. Oh right, the cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile. But wait, ketones generally undergo nucleophilic addition, but the conditions matter. Like, sometimes you need an acid catalyst.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So NaCN is providing the cyanide nucleophile. So the reaction is adding the cyanide to the carbonyl group. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, giving (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, no. Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohy
