Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, the Sun's core processes... I remember that the proton-proton chain has a couple of branches. The main pp-I branch produces deuterium, then goes on to helium. There's also the pp-II branch which I think involves higher energy levels of boron or something. And the pp-III branchâ€”oh right, it's a specific part that emits a neutrino. Oh yeah, the pp-III branch is the one that produces a positron and a neutrino when a boron-8 nucleus captures a proton.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that means no more neutrinos from that process. But wait, the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how much of the neutrino flux comes from each band when pp-III stops.

Let me recall the solar neutrino production. The main contributors are the pp-III branch, the CNO cycle, and the boron burning (like in the case of the pep branch, but that's part of pp-I, I think). Wait, the pep branch produces lower energy neutrinos around
