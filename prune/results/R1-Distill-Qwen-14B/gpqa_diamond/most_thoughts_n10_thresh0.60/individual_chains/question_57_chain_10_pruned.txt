Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles like electrons scatter off a target, the scattering can be described using something called phase shifts. The question gives me some phase shifts, and I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Let me try to break this down. The phase shifts are given as δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And I'm supposed to ignore the rest beyond δ₄. So, I guess that means we only consider these five phase shifts.

Wait, the scattering amplitude... I think for partial waves, each phase shift δ_l corresponds to a specific angular momentum l. So δ₀ would be for l=0, which is the s-wave, δ₁ is l=1, p-wave, and so on. Each of these contributes to the total scattering amplitude.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a formula that sums over all the partial waves. The general form is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (a_l + b_l) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ), but wait, no, more accurately, it's a sum over l of [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (something) ].

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude in terms of phase shifts is given by f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} [ (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * (2l + 1) * (sin(lθ + δ_l)) ) ].

But wait, another thought: the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0. Because the question mentions the incident beam direction, which would be θ=0, right? Because the incident direction is along the beam, so the scattered angle is zero. 

Wait, but θ=0 might cause some terms to be zero. Because sin(l*0 + δ_l) is sin(δ_l), which is just sin(δ_l), but for the imaginary part, perhaps we can compute it.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is often written as f
