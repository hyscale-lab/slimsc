Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But I think they have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. From the question, ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait a second. The question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So if a star is brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the apparent V magnitude of the star needs to be brighter than 16 for HIRES, and brighter than 17 for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, wait. No, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," which I think means that if the apparent V is less than 17, it's brighter. Because lower magnitude values are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V is 17 or fainter, then ESPRESSO can't see it. Because the question says "brighter than 17" can be observed. So the limit is apparent V <17 for ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V <16.

So a star must have apparent V magnitude less than 17 (brighter than 17) to be seen by ESPRESSO, and less than 16 (brighter than 16) for HIRES. But wait, the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent V must be brighter than (i.e., less than in value) 17 for ESPRESSO and less than 16 for HIRES. So the star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16. Because that way it's brighter than 16, so HIRES can see it, and since it's also brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. So any star with apparent V magnitude less than 16 can be detected by both.

But wait, looking at the stars,
