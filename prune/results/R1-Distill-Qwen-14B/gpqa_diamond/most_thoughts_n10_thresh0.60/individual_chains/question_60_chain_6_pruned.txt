Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super-fast spacecraft that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. They're sending an astronaut who's 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes for the astronaut to reach Earth from their own perspective. The options are whether the astronaut dies before reaching, or whether they live about 72, 81, or 77 years.

Wait, wait, the question specifies that it's from the astronaut's point of view. So this is a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. Oh right, because when you're moving at such a high speed, time dilation occurs, and the distance might appear shorter from the astronaut's perspective.

But wait, the problem is about the time experienced by the astronaut. So I need to calculate the proper time, which is the time measured in the moving frame (the spaceship's frame of reference) relative to the Earth's frame.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, the problem doesn't give me that distance. Oh, I think I need to calculate it using the given speed and figure out the time from Earth's frame, then see how it's perceived from the spaceship.

Wait, but no, the problem says "from the point of view of the astronaut." So perhaps I should consider the Earth's frame and the spaceship's frame.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Oh, right, so the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years. But wait, I'm not sure if the exact figure is needed here, or if it's given in the problem. Hmm, the question says "engineered an extraordinary spacecraft..." but it doesn't give the distance. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to assume the distance is about the distance to the LMC, which is around that.

Wait, the problem says the average lifetime is 150 solar years, but the astronaut is 22. So without any time dilation, the astronaut would live another 1
