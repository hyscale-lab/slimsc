Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are found using the formula ⟨ψ|Ô|ψ⟩, where Ô is the operator in question. 

The spin state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation is for a two-component spinor. So the state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. Right, because electrons have spin-1/2, so their spin states are two-dimensional.

The operator for S_y is given as σ_y, which is the Pauli matrix. The matrix for σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, and I remember that S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. Because the spin operators are (σ · n) * ħ/2, where n is the direction. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y in this state. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write out the components. The state ψ is [3i, 4]^T. The conjugate transpose (bra) ⟨ψ| would be [ -3, 4i ] because I take the complex conjugate of each component. 

Wait, wait. Wait a second, the original state is (3i,4), so the components are 3i and 4. So the bra is [ (3i)*, (4)* ] which is [ -3, 4 ], but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? No, wait. 3i is a purely imaginary number, so its conjugate is -3i. Oh wait, no, wait. Oh no, wait: 3i is 3 multiplied by i. The complex conjugate of i is -i, so (3i)* is 3*(-i) = -3i. So the bra vector is [-3i, 4], because the original ket is [3i,4], so the bra is [ (3i)*, (4)* ] which is [ -3i, 4 ]. Wait, no, wait. No, that's not right. Because in a ket vector, each component is a complex number, and the bra is the conjugate transpose. So the first component of the ket is 3i, so the first component of the bra is the conjugate, which is -3i. The second component is 4, which is real, so its conjugate is 4. So the bra is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value ⟨σ_y⟩ is ψ† σ_y ψ. Let me compute this matrix product.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let's compute ψ† σ_y ψ.

First, ψ is a column vector [3i; 4], ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So, ψ† σ_y
