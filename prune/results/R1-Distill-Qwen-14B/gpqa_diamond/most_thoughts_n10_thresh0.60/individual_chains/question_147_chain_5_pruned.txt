Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The process given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of charge + and two of charge -. Wait, but I think that's probably a typo, because A⁺ and A⁻ might be different particles. But maybe it's just two of each, making sure the charges balance. Let me not get stuck on that.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So, its speed is low compared to the speed of light, maybe non-relativistic? Or does that mean that the kinetic energy isn't too high? Hmm. But wait, the question is about the velocity of particle A, so I probably need to figure out their speed.

The given mass-energy of A is mA c² = 300 MeV. So, each A has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV. I think I'll need to use conservation laws here, maybe energy and momentum. Since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, let's note their masses and charges.

Wait, the proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton has the same mass. So, the initial system's rest mass would be 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving
