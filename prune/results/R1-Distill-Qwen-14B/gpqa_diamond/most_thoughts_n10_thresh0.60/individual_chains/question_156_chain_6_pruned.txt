Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still a bit new to this.

The question is about two reactions involving different ene structures and the products formed when they're treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are analyzed using HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. The options are about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Hmm. So first, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product.

Wait, but wait. The starting alkenes here are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are reacting with mCPBA, and then treated with aqueous acid. Oh right, after epoxidation, sometimes the epoxide can undergo ring-opening under acidic conditions. But wait, the problem says both reactions go to 100% completion. Hmm, so what's happening here.

Wait, no. Wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But then, when aqueous acid is added, what happens? Epoxides can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Oh right, the ring opening of epoxides under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of diols, specifically trans-dihydroxyl groups because the ring opens with nucleophilic attack.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The epoxide is a three-membered ring with two oxygen atoms. In acid, the ring opens. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the more substituted carbon (since it's more stabilized), leading to ring opening. The attack occurs from the opposite side, leading to trans addition.

Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, the product would be the same regardless of the attack direction. But let's get back to the structure of the starting alkenes.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. Its structure is CH2CH2 on either end of the double bond. Since the
