Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has a period of, say, P, Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 has 2.5P, Planet_4 has 3.5P, and Planet_5 has 5P.

They're asking about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. And all planets have the same albedo. Oh, right, albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same for all, it cancels out in the ratio.

Equilibrium temperature is calculated using the formula: T = T0 * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T0 is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, wait—another formula I remember is T = T_earth * (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). No, maybe more accurately, the equilibrium temperature (assuming no greenhouse effect and perfect blackbody) is given by T = T_star * ( (R_star) / (2 a) )^(1/2). Because the star's flux at distance a is L/(4πa²), and the planet absorbs that over a disk area (so πR²), and emits from a surface area (4π R_p², but if R_p is much smaller than R_star, it's approximated as R_star in the formula? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of inverse square law.

Wait, the formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)). Since the star's temperature is T_star, and the planet's distance is a. Because the flux from the star is F = L/(4πa²) = (σ T_star^4) * (4π R_star²)/(4π a²) ) → F = σ T_star^4 (R_star²/a²). Then, the planet's equilibrium temperature is where the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy. The planet has a cross-section area of π R_p², so the absorbed power is F * π R_p². The emitted power is 4π R_p² σ T^4. Setting them equal: F = 4 σ T^4. So, F = σ T^4 *4. Substituting F: σ T_star^4 (R_star²/a²) = 4 σ T^4. Cancel σ, rearrange: T^4 = (T_star^4 R_star²) / (4 a²). Take the fourth root: T = T_star * (R_star) / (2 a) )^(1/2 ). So yes, T ∝ sqrt(R/(2a)), assuming R_star is the star's radius.

But wait, in this problem, we are comparing the temperatures of different planets around the same star. So T_star and R_star would be the same for all. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Because the formula is T ∝ sqrt(R/(2a)) → but R is the same for all, so T ∝ 1/sqrt(a).

So, the ratio of temperatures T4 / T2 would be (a2 / a4)^(1/2) → because T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Wait, no: T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So if a4 is larger than a2, then T4 is smaller than T2. So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2).

But wait, wait. Let me correct that. T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So, T4 = K * (1/sqrt(a4)), T2 = K*(1/sqrt(a2)). So T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4).

So the ratio is sqrt( a2 / a4 ). But how do I find a2 and a4?

I know that the orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 :5.

But Kepler's third law says that (a^3)/(P^2) = (G M_star)/(4 π²), so a^3 ∝ P^2. Therefore, a = k * P^(2/3), where k is a constant for the system.

So, the ratio a4 / a2 is (P4/P2)^(2/3). Because a ∝ P^(2/3), so a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Let me compute P4 and P2. P2 is 2 * P1, P4 is 3.5 * P1.

So, P4 / P2 = 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

So, a4 / a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

Wait, let me compute that. 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let's compute this.

Wait, alternatively, let's compute (3.5/2) = 1.75. Then, 1.75^(2/3).

Hmm, 1.75 = 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3) = ( (7/4)^(1/3) )^2. Let me approximate (7/4)^(1/3).

7/4 is 1.75. The cube root of 1.75 is approximately 1.2, since 1.2^3=1.728, which is close to 1.75. So cube root is about 1.205. Then, squared is about 1.452. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.452.

Wait, but wait: We need a2 / a4, because in the temperature ratio it's a2/a4 under the square root. So a2/a4 = 1/(a4/a2) = 1/1.452 ≈ 0.689.

So, the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) = sqrt(0.689) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, sqrt(0.689) is about 0.83. Because 0.83^2 is about 0.6889.

So, the ratio is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Another approach: compute a2 and a4 in terms of a1.

a ∝ P^(2/3). So a1 = k * P1^(2/3).

a2 = k * (2 P1)^(2/3) = k * 2^(2/3) * P1^(2/3).

a4 = k * (3.5 P1)^(2/3) = k * (3.5)^(2/3) * P1^(2/3).

So a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3) ≈ (1.75)^(0.6667).

Calculating 1.75^0.6667: let's compute it.

We can take natural logs. ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: 0.5596 * 0.6667 ≈ 0.373. Then exponentiate: e^0.373 ≈ 1.452. So a4/a2 ≈1.452.

So a2/a4 ≈ 1/1.452 ≈ 0.689.

Then, sqrt(0.689) ≈ 0.83.

Yes, so the temperature ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(a\) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since all planets orbit the same star, the proportionality constant is the same for all planets. Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}}
\]

From Kepler's third law, \(a^3 \propto P^2\), so \(a \propto P^{2/3}\). Using the orbital period ratios provided (\(P_4/P_2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75\)), we calculate:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = (1.75)^{2/3}
\]

Approximating \((1.75)^{2/3}\), we find:

\[
(1.75)^{1/3} \approx 1.205 \quad \text{and} \quad (1.75)^{2/3} \approx 1.452
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_4} = \frac{1}{1.452} \approx 0.689
\]

Substituting into the temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{0.689} \approx 0.83
\]

Therefore, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.
