Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding an eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem says we're dealing with a quantum mechanical operator P, which is a vector operator. The components are P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. We need to find the eigenvector of P in the direction of an arbitrary unit vector n lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, I think the operator in an arbitrary direction n would be the vector operator dotted with the unit vector. So the operator we're interested in is P·n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, its y-component must be zero. So n_y = 0, and n is (n_x, 0, n_z). But since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Wait, no, in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n has components (n_x, 0, n_z), right. So P·n would be P_x n_x + 0 * P_y + P_z n_z. So the operator is P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So we're looking for a normalized eigenvector |v> such that (P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

But wait, each component P_x, P_y, P_z is already multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write out the matrices.

Given:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by a Pauli matrix. So P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is
