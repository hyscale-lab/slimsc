Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to calculate the eigenvector of a certain operator for a muon along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem gives me the components of the operator P along the x, y, and z axes. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The operator in question is probably the spin operator, since we're dealing with a muon (which has spin-1/2) and the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So I'm guessing the operator is the spin angular momentum operator S, but the question refers to it as P, so maybe it's another operator with similar properties.

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means it's in the XZ-plane, so its direction can be described by an angle θ from the x-axis, but since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0, or perhaps the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) if we're using spherical coordinates. Wait, no, in spherical coordinates, it's usually (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). Since φ is zero here because it's in the x-z plane, the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, in the x-z plane, maybe θ is measured from the z-axis. Hmm, no, sometimes θ is polar angle from the z-axis, so in x-z plane, φ=0 or π. Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe that's a detail for later.

The problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n when the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x X + P_y Y + P_z Z, where X, Y, Z are the direction components. So the operator along direction n is P_n = n · P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let me note that n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =
