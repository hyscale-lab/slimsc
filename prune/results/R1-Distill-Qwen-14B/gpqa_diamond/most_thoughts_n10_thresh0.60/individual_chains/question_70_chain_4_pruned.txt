Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and we need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember these are related to molecular shapes and their symmetry elements. So the first step is to figure out what E is made of.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, solid A plus gas B (8 moles) gives C. Bright red makes me think of something like a transition metal compound. Maybe a sulfide or oxide? Wait, 8 equivalents—could that ratio be significant? Like, maybe B is a diatomic gas, so 8 could relate to the valency. For example, if B is O2, 8 equivalents would mean O8? That's not right. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal. Let me think of metals that form bright red compounds. Copper comes to mind. For example, copper(II) oxide is black, but copper sulfide is black too. Oh wait, maybe it's a different type of compound. What about lead? Lead(II,IV) oxide is dark brown, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. When a solid reacts with a diatomic gas in a high ratio, maybe it's something like sulfur reacting with oxygen. But sulfur is a solid, right? Or perhaps it's a metal reacting with a halogen. Wait, maybe solid A is iron, and B is Cl2? But iron(III) chloride isn't red. Alternatively, maybe A is aluminum and B is fluorine? That would make AlF3, but I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, maybe it's something else. Let's think about the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So what would produce a dangerous substance when reacting with another gas? Maybe E is a highly toxic gas or a dangerous compound.

Looking at the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C
