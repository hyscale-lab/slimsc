Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with a sigma bond. They are pericyclic reactions, which usually involve concerted movements of electrons. The most common ones I know are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, but there are others too, like the Nazarov cyclization or the electrocyclic reactions.

The problem has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A. Wait, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a molecule where the amine is attached to two methoxy groups. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or maybe it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, so with two methoxy groups on the first carbon. So it's (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or maybe the amine is on the same carbon as the two methoxys. Oh, right, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? Wait, no: ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups attached to the first carbon, which is the same as the amine. So the structure is OCH3-O-C-NH2? No, perhaps it's CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it mentally. The first carbon (attached to NH2) has two OCH3 groups. So the molecule is (OCH3)2CHNH2? Alternatively, maybe it's OCH2-NH2? No, wait 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine. So it's (CH3O)2CHNH2? Or perhaps (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? No, because ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2, so the first carbon is CH2
