Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment μ, which is given as γ times S_z. Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment once the fields change.

Hmm, I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin of a particle aligns with the field due to the Zeeman effect. But here, the field changes direction, which probably affects the spin state.

So first, the initial state. Since the field is along +Z, the particle's spin will be in the eigenstate of S_z. Since it's spin 1/2, the possible states are up or down along Z. The magnetic moment μ is proportional to S_z, so the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. 

Then, the field is switched off and turned on along Y. Wait, the sequence is: first B is along Z, then B is along Y. So the Hamiltonian must change from H1 = -γ B S_z (since μ = γ S_z and the energy is -μ·B) to H2 = -γ B S_y.

Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic moment is μ = γ S, so the energy is U = -μ·B. So for the initial state, H1 is proportional to S_z. After the change, H2 is proportional to S_y. So the Hamiltonian changes from H1 to H2, which changes the dynamics of the system.

But wait, the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment after the field changes. So after the field switches, how does the spin state evolve, and what happens to <S_z>?

I think we can model this using time evolution under the new Hamiltonian H2. Since the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, when the field switches to Y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, which is proportional to S_y.

In quantum mechanics, when a system is in a state that's not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

So the initial state is |ψ(0)>, which is either |↑_z> or |↓_z>. Let's say it's |↑_z>, the eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2. But wait, S_z has eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for spin 1/2 particles.

Wait, the exact form might matter. Let me think: The spin states can be represented in the eigenbasis of S_z as |↑> = (1,0) and |↓> = (0,1) in a two-component vector notation.

The initial state is |↑> because the magnetic field is along +Z, so the spin aligns to minimize energy.

Now, when the magnetic field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -γ B S_y. So S_y is the spin component in the y-direction. The matrix representation of S_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So H = -γ B (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me factor out the constants: H = ( - γ B ħ / (2i) ) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Wait, maybe I should compute it correctly.

Wait, S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H = -γ B * (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So H can be written as ( - γ B ħ / 2 ) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write H in terms of angular frequency. The energy levels split by the magnetic field. The energy is proportional to the spin component along the field direction
