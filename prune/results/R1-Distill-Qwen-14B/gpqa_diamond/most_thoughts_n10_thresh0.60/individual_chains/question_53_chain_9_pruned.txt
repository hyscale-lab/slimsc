Okay, I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem. So let's try to break it down. The question is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectral data. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let's go through the information given.

The compound has a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have specific absorption peaks, usually a strong one around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound must have an ester functional group somewhere.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me list them out as per the question. Two signals are for aromatic-H. So, the substitution on the benzene ring must create two different sets of aromatic protons. That suggests that the substituents are in positions that cause the ring's protons to split into two distinct groups. For example, para substitution would lead to two sets of aromatic protons if the substituents are identical but in para positions. Wait, no, actually, if it's di-substituted, and the substituents are the same, like two ester groups in para positions, then the ring would have equivalent protons, giving a singlet maybe. Hmm, but here it's two signals, so perhaps the substituents are different.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. If the substituents are in positions that make the ring have two non-equivalent sets of protons. For example, if the substituents are in the ortho and para positions, but that's not possible since it's di-substituted. Oh wait, di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. So if the two substituents are meta, that would create two sets of equivalent protons. Or if the substituents are ortho, creating a 1,2-disubstitution. Let's not get stuck here yet.

Moving on, the NMR has two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or more complex splitting if near other substituents. So this suggests we have some vinyl groups, like in an ester group. Wait, in an est
