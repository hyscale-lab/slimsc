Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

So, the problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because of these spots, when the star rotates, its brightness changes, and this looks like the light curve variations caused by an exoplanet. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation as these spots?

Hmm. Right, I remember that the brightness variation (the change in flux) depends on the area of the star blocked by a planet or, in this case, the spots. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they come into view, the star's total brightness decreases. Similarly, a planet transiting in front of the star blocks some of the light, causing a dip in brightness.

The problem is asking about what the planet's radius (relative to the star) would need to be to produce the same dip in brightness as the spots do when the star rotates. So we're comparing two scenarios: one where the star has spots causing brightness variation, and the other where a planet transiting the star causes a similar dip.

First, let's think about the star's spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Since it's a hemisphere, I guess the entire area of the hemisphere is considered. Wait, no. Wait, the star's surface area for a sphere is 4πR², but since it's a hemisphere, it's 2πR². But when talking about the filling factor, it's the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that's covered by spots. So 20% of the hemisphere's area is spots.

The temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K. The flux from each spot is lower than the surrounding area, so when the spots rotate into view, the total flux decreases, which is what causes the periodic variation.

Wait, but the key is to find the amplitude of this variation and compare it to the variation caused by a planet. So the idea is to compute how much the spots' presence reduces the star's brightness and set that equal to the reduction caused by the planet.

I think I need to compute the fractional change in flux for both cases and set them equal.

The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area and the temperature to the fourth power. So the total flux without spots would be L = 4πR² * σ T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But with spots, part of the surface is emitting less. So the total flux when the spots are visible would be L' = L * (1 - f) + L_spot, where f is the filling factor, and L_spot is the flux from the spotted area.

Wait, let me think. The filling factor f is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So L' = (1 - f) * L_hemisphere + f * L_hemisphere_spot.

Wait, the hemisphere's flux is (1/2) * L, since the star emits over 4π, and a hemisphere is 2π steradians. So the hemisphere's flux is (1/2) L = 2 π R² σ T^4.

Then, the spots cover f fraction of that hemisphere. So the flux from the spots would be f * (2 π R²) * σ (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are on the hemisphere is:
L' = (1 - f) * (2 π R² σ T^4) + f * (2 π R² σ (T_spot)^4 )

We can factor out 2 π R² σ:
L' = 2 π R² σ [ (1 - f) T^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ]

The flux without any spots (if the spots weren't there) would be L = 4 π R² σ T^4. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: the total flux when the star is viewed from the side where the hemisphere is unspotted would be L = 4 π R² σ T^4, because the entire star is emitting at T. But in the scenario where spots are present on a hemisphere, when the star rotates such that the hemisphere is facing us, the flux is L' as above.

Wait, perhaps I should model the change in brightness as the star rotates. The star has one hemisphere with spots, so when the spots are on the side facing us, the flux will be lower. The variation in brightness would be the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go out of view. The maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible. So the brightness change ΔF is F_unspotted - F_spotted.

Wait no, actually, when the spots are on the side facing us, the flux is lower than when they're on the far side. So the dip is F_unspotted - F_spotted, and the relative change is (F_unspotted - F_spotted) / F_unspotted.

Wait, but the problem says that the star's brightness variation is similar to an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the variation (the depth of the dip) should be the same for both cases.

So let's compute the fractional change in flux due to the spots.

The flux when the spots are fully visible is L' = (F_unspotted) * ( (1 - f) * (T^4) + f * (T_spot^4) ) / (T^4) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the fractional change.

The flux from the unspotted area is (1 - f) times the area of the hemisphere times T^4. The flux from the spotted area is f times the area times (T_spot)^4.

But the total flux without any spots (if the entire star is at T) would be 4 π R² σ T^4.

Wait, no. When the spots are on the far side, the flux is the full star's emission. When the star rotates so the hemisphere with spots is facing us, the flux is L' as computed earlier.

So when the spots are visible, the flux is lower. The dip is (L - L') / L.

So the fractional change is (L - L') / L = 1 - (L' / L).

Compute L' / L:

L' = 2 π R² σ [ (1 - f) T^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ]

L = 4 π R² σ T^4.

So L' / L = [2 π R² σ ( (1-f) T^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 π R² σ T^4 ]

The R² and σ terms cancel out, and so do the π terms.

So L' / L = ( (1-f) T^4 + f T_spot^4 ) * 2 / (4 T^4 )

Simplify denominator: 4 is 2*2. So 2/(4) is 1/2.

So L' / L = [ (1 - f) T^4 + f T_spot^4 ] / (2 T^4 )

Which simplifies to:

[ (1 - f) T^4 ] / (2 T^4 ) + [ f T_spot^4 ]/(2 T^4 )

= (1 - f)/(2) + f (T_spot / T )^4 / 2

So the fractional change is 1 - L' / L = 1 - [ (1 - f)/2 + f (T_spot^4)/(2 T^4) ]

Wait, let's compute that:

delta_F = 1 - [ (1-f)/2 + (f T_spot^4 )/(2 T^4) ]

Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

f = 20% = 0.2

T = 6000 K

T_spot = 5000 K.

So T_spot / T = 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(T_spot / T)^4 = (5/6)^4. Let me compute that:

5^4 = 625, 6^4=1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So (T_spot / T)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

Now, putting into delta_F:

delta_F = 1 - [ (1 - 0.2)/2 + 0.2 * 0.48225 / 2 ]

Compute each part:

(1 - 0.2) = 0.8 → 0.8 / 2 = 0.4.

0.2 * 0.48225 = 0.09645 → divided by 2 → 0.048225.

Adding these two: 0.4 + 0.048225 = 0.448225.

So delta_F = 1 - 0.448225 = 0.551775.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would mean the flux drops by about 55%, which is a huge dip. But 20% of the hemisphere is spots at 5000K. The unspotted part is at 6000K. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: The star's brightness when the spots are visible is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

Wait, the star's total flux when spots are in view is:

Flux_total = (Area_unspotted * T_unspotted^4) + (Area_spotted * T_spotted^4)

But the Area_unspotted is (1 - f) of the hemisphere. The Area_spotted is f of the hemisphere.

Wait, but the hemisphere's area is 2πR², so the unspotted area is (1-f)*2πR², and the spotted area is f *2πR².

So the flux when spots are visible is:

Flux = (1-f)*2πR² * σ T^4 + f * 2π R² * σ (T_spot)^4

= 2π R² σ [ (1-f) T^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ]

The total flux without any spots would be 4 π R² σ T^4.

So the ratio is Flux / Flux_total_unspotted = [2 π ... ] / [4 π ... ] = [2 π R² σ ( ... ) ] / [4 π R² σ T^4 ]

Which simplifies to (2π cancels with 4π to 1/2, R² and σ cancel).

So the ratio is [ (1-f) T^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ] / (2 T^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So delta_F = 1 - [ (1-f)/2 + (f (T_spot^4))/ (2 T^4) ]

Plugging in the numbers again:

f=0.2, T=6000, T_spot=5000.

(1-f) is 0.8. So 0.8/2 = 0.4.

f*(T_spot^4)/(2 T^4) → 0.2 * (5000^4)/(6000^4) / 2.

Compute (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 = 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 0.2 * 0.48225 = 0.09645.

Divide by 2: 0.048225.

So the ratio is 0.4 + 0.048225 = 0.448225.

So delta_F = 1 - 0.448225 = 0.551775 → approximately 55% dip in flux.

Wait, that's a big dip. But the problem states that the star's brightness variation is similar to that of an exoplanet. So the exoplanet's transit would cause the same dip.

Wait, but when a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light. The dip in flux is (Area_planet / Area_star) * (T_planet^4 / T^4) ? No, wait, no: because the planet doesn't emit, it just blocks the star's light.

Wait no, when the planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's surface. So the flux decrease is (Area_blocked / Area_star) * (Flux per unit area of the star that's blocked).

Wait, the star emits uniformly at T, so the flux per unit area is sigma T^4. So the dip is (R_planet^2 / R_star^2) * (sigma T^4 / (sigma T^4)) ) → (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, because when the planet blocks R_p^2 area, the flux loss is (R_p^2 / R_s^2 ) * (sigma T^4 ) over the entire star's emission.

Wait, no. The entire star's emission is 4 pi R_s^2 sigma T^4. If the planet blocks an area pi R_p^2 (a circle), assuming it's a disk, then the blocked flux is pi R_p^2 sigma T^4.

Wait, but the star's total flux is 4 pi R_s^2 sigma T^4. So the fractional change is (pi R_p^2 sigma T^4 ) / (4 pi R_s^2 sigma T^4 ) = (R_p^2 ) / (4 R_s^2 )

So the dip is (R_p / (2 R_s ))^2.

Wait, so the fractional change when the planet transits is (R_p / (2 R_s ))^2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

When a planet transits, it blocks a part of the star's surface. The star's surface is at T, so each unit area emits sigma T^4. The area blocked is pi R_p^2 (diameter 2 R_p, so radius R_p; area is pi R_p^2). So the blocked flux is pi R_p^2 sigma T^4.

The total flux is 4 pi R_s^2 sigma T^4.

So the dip is (pi R_p^2) / (4 pi R_s^2 ) ) = (R_p^2) / (4 R_s^2 ) ) → (R_p/(2 R_s ))^2.

Wait, no, because pi cancels out:

(pi R_p^2) / (4 pi R_s^2 ) ) → (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2) → (R_p/(2 R_s ))^2.

Wait, but when the planet transits, the dip is (R_p / R_s )^2. No, wait, because the ratio is (blocked area) / (total area). The blocked area is pi R_p^2. The star's area is 4 pi R_s^2. So the dip is (pi R_p^2 ) / (4 pi R_s^2 ) ) = (R_p^2)/(4 R_s^2 ) → which is (R_p/(2 R_s))^2.

Hmm, but I've seen it calculated as (R_p / R_s )^2 before. Wait, perhaps because sometimes the star is approximated as a circular disk, and the area is pi R_s^2, but actually it's a sphere, so the area is 4 pi R_s^2. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing between apparent area and the surface area.

Wait, perhaps for the purposes of transit depth, the area is the projected area of the star, which is pi R_s^2 (the disk). So when the planet is in front, the area blocked is the area of the planet as seen from Earth, which is the same as the disk area: pi R_p^2. So the dip is (pi R_p^2 ) / (pi R_s^2 ) ) = (R_p/R_s )^2.

Ah, that makes more sense. Because the transit depth is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the star's disk. So the transit depth is (R_p/R_s )^2.

So now, the problem states that the spot-induced brightness variation is the same as the planet transit. So the dip caused by the spots (delta_F_spot) equals the dip caused by the planet (delta_F_planet).

Wait, but wait: the delta_F_spot is the fractional change in flux when the spots are visible. So for the star with spots, the dip is delta_F_spot = 0.551775, approximately 55%.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if 20% of the hemisphere is cooler, but the rest is at the same temperature, that dip can't be 55% of the total flux. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me compute delta_F_spot correctly.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots is 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

When the spots are on the hemisphere visible to us, the flux is the sum of the unspotted and spotted parts.

The unspotted part is (1-f) * 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

The spotted part is f * 2 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux is:

Flux = (1-f)*2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 + f * 2 pi R^2 sigma T_spot^4.

Factor out 2 pi R^2 sigma:

Flux = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ (1-f) T^4 + f T_spot^4 ]

Then, the dip is (Flux_unspotted - Flux) / Flux_unspotted.

Flux_unspotted is the star's flux without any spots, which is 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So:

dip = (4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 - 2 pi R^2 sigma [ (1-f) T^4 + f T_spot^4 ]) ) / (4 pi R^2 sigma T^4 )

Simplify numerator:

4 pi R² sigma T^4 - 2 pi R² sigma [ (1-f) T^4 + f T_spot^4 ]

= 2 pi R² sigma [2 T^4 - ( (1-f) T^4 + f T_spot^4 ) ]

So, dip = [2 pi R² sigma ( 2 T^4 - (1-f) T^4 - f T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² sigma T^4 ]

Cancel terms:

= [ 2 pi R² sigma ( (2 - (1-f)) T^4 - f T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² sigma T^4 ]

Wait, 2 T^4 - (1-f) T^4 - f T_spot^4 = [2 - (1-f)] T^4 - f T_spot^4.

Wait, 2 - (1-f) = 1 + f.

So numerator becomes (1 + f) T^4 - f T_spot^4.

So,

dip = [ 2 pi R² sigma ( (1+f) T^4 - f T_spot^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² sigma T^4 ]

Simplify:

= [ 2 ( (1 + f) T^4 - f T_spot^4 ) ) ] / (4 T^4 )

= [ ( (1 + f) T^4 - f T_spot^4 ) ) ] / ( 2 T^4 )

Factor T^4:

= [ (1 + f) - f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ) ] / 2

So,

dip = [ (1 + f) - f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ) ] / 2

Plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.2, T=6000, T_spot=5000.

(T_spot/T) = 5/6 → (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So,

(1 + f) = 1.2

f * (T_spot^4 / T^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.48225 ≈ 0.09645

So,

dip = [ 1.2 - 0.09645 ] / 2 = (1.103555) / 2 ≈ 0.5517775.

So dip ≈ 0.5518, or 55.18% dip in brightness.

Wait, that's a big dip. Now, when a planet transits, the dip is (R_p/R_s )^2, as I thought earlier. So to have the same dip, (R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.5518 → R_p = R_s * sqrt(0.5518).

Wait, but sqrt(0.5518) is about 0.7429, so R_p ≈ 0.743 R_s. But this would make the planet larger than the star, which is impossible because the star is larger than any planet around it.

Wait, that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the dip calculation. Let me think again about the scenario.

Wait, when the star is not spotty, the dip due to the planet would be (R_p/R_s )^2. But in the problem, the star is spotty, and the question is asking what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots.

Wait, no, the problem says: 'To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)'

Wait, if the star was not covered by spots, what would be the radius of the planet to give the same dip as the spots do.

Wait, the spots cause a dip of about 55%, which is a lot. But a planet would have to block a lot of the star's area to cause such a dip. But since planets can't be larger than the star, this suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Maybe I should compute the relative change in brightness due to the spots, not the absolute dip.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the star rotating and the spots being on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. The maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is visible. But perhaps I'm not considering the correct fraction of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps I should model the brightness variation as the star's surface being partially blocked by spots. The spots are on a hemisphere, but when the star rotates, only part of the spots are visible. Wait, no. The question states that one hemisphere is completely covered in spots, so when the star rotates so that the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the entire 20% of the hemisphere is blocking light. But if the star is rotating, perhaps the spots come into view over time, leading to a varying brightness, but the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back.

The problem says that the star's brightness variation due to spots is similar to a planet's transit. The question is, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spots.

So for the planet, dip = (R_p/R_s )^2.

For the spots, dip is about 0.5518 as I calculated earlier.

But that would require R_p ≈ 74% R_s, which is impossible because planets orbiting a star can't be larger than the star itself.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the dip calculation for the spots. Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: The star's spots lower its brightness when they're visible. The brightness variation is the difference between when the spots are visible and when they're not.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

When the spots are visible, the flux is F1 = (1 - f) * F_hemisphere_unspotted + f * F_hemisphere_spotted.

Wait, the hemisphere's area is 2 pi R^2, so F_hemisphere_unspotted = 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4.

So F1 = (1 - f) * 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 + f * 2 pi R^2 sigma (T_spot)^4.

So F1 = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ (1-f) T^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ]

The dip is F0 - F1.

Wait, no, F0 is when the entire star is at T. F1 is when a hemisphere is at T and the other at T_spot. But wait, no: the star's other hemisphere is not spotted, so when the star rotates, the unspotted hemisphere would be at T, and the spotted hemisphere is at lower T. But when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F1 = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ ... ] as before.

So the dip would be F0 (entire star at T) minus F1 (spotted hemisphere). But wait, F0 is the star's total flux without any spots, but when the star rotates, one hemisphere is spotted and the other is not. So when the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F1 = 2 pi R^2 sigma [ ... ].

Wait, but F0 is 4 pi R^2 sigma T^4. The flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is F1 = (2 pi R^2 sigma [ (1-f) T^4 + f (T_spot)^4 ]).

So the dip is F0 - F1.

Wait, but when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F1. So the dip is F0 - F1.

Wait, but F0 is when the entire star is at T, but when the spotted hemisphere is visible, only that hemisphere's flux is as calculated. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute F1 relative to F0.

Wait, perhaps I should model the flux when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, F1, and when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, F2.

Wait, no. The star's other hemisphere (unspotted) would also be at T, so when the star is viewed from the other side, the flux is F2 = 2 pi R² sigma T^4.

Wait, but this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach.

The total flux when the star is viewed with the spotted hemisphere is F1 = (1-f) * 2 pi R² sigma T^4 + f * 2 pi R² sigma (T_spot)^4.

The total flux when the star is viewed with the unspotted hemisphere is F2 = 2 pi R² sigma T^4.

The average flux when the star is viewed from either side (assuming rotation) would be (F1 + F2)/2.

Wait, but the problem states that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is similar to a planet. So perhaps the dip is the difference between the maximum flux (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible) and the minimum flux (when the spotted hemisphere is visible).

So the dip would be (F2 - F1) / F2.

Which is [ (2 pi R² sigma T^4) - ( (1-f) * 2 pi R² sigma T^4 + f * 2 pi R² sigma (T_spot)^4 ) ) ] / (2 pi R² sigma T^4 )

Simplify numerator:

= 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 [ 1 - (1-f) - f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 [ f - f (T_spot^4 / T^4) ]

= 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 f ( 1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4) )

So the dip (delta_F) is:

[ 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 f (1 - (T_spot^4/T^4)) ] / [ 2 pi R^2 sigma T^4 ]

= f (1 - (T_spot^4 / T^4)).

So delta_F = f (1 - (T_spot/T)^4 )

Hmm, that's a much simpler expression. So let me plug in the numbers.

f = 0.2, T=6000, T_spot=5000.

(T_spot/T) = 5/6 → (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

So delta_F = 0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355%.

That's more reasonable. So the dip caused by the spots is about 10.35% of the star's flux.

Now, the planet transit dip is (R_p/R_s )^2. To have the same dip, (R_p/R_s )^2 = 0.10355 → R_p = R_s * sqrt(0.10355).

Compute sqrt(0.10355). Let's see: 0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is very close to 0.10355.

So R_p/R_s ≈ 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32.

So the answer would be D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's dark spots, we compare the fractional change in flux for both scenarios.

### Step 1: Fractional Change in Flux Due to Spots
The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \). The spots are cooler, with a temperature \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \). The fractional change in flux (\( \Delta F_{\text{spot}} \)) when the spots are visible is given by:

\[
\Delta F_{\text{spot}} = f \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right)
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( f = 0.2 \),
- \( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} = \frac{5000}{6000} = \frac{5}{6} \),
- \( \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \),

\[
\Delta F_{\text{spot}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355
\]

Thus, the fractional change in flux due to the spots is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

### Step 2: Fractional Change in Flux Due to a Planet
When an exoplanet transits the star, it blocks a fraction of the star's light proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The fractional change in flux (\( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} \)) is given by:

\[
\Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
\]

To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, we set \( \Delta F_{\text{planet}} = \Delta F_{\text{spot}} \):

\[
\left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.32
\]
