Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. So the star moves toward and away from us, causing spectral lines to shift.

Wait, the question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. So both stars have same mass, M, and both planets have same mass, m. But the Doppler shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet 1 and 7 for planet 2.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. How much longer is planet 2's period compared to planet 1's?

Hmm, I need to find P2/P1. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude K is related to the Doppler shift. So the higher the K, the bigger the wobble, which probably relates to the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, the RV method formula: K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) ? Or wait, I think the formula for the semi-amplitude K is something like K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * c ) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p â‰ˆ M_star.

But wait, the problem states that both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. So M_star is same for both, and M_p is same for both. So K should be proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))).

Wait, but more accurately, the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) * c ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3)))

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2
