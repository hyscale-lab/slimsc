Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutations. Hmm, I need to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. So the gene structure is exons 1-5 with introns in between.

They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is ethyl methanesulfonate, a chemical mutagen that causes point mutations, usually leading to substitutions because it's an alkylating agent. These mutations are often missense or nonsense, or maybe silent if it's synonymous.

Looking at the sequences, the question shows the intact gene and four mutants. We need to find which mutation would eliminate the compound. That probably means the gene's function is disrupted, so the protein won't be made or will be non-functional.

The target is the first exon area. Exons are coding regions, so mutations here can affect the protein. Let me think about each mutant and the type of mutation they have.

The intact gene sequence is:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the mutants:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, the first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT... I think the change is in the third codon. Let me see. The first few codons:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ...
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCT... Hmm, wait, maybe looking at individual nucleotides.

Wait, maybe I should compare each position.

Let me line them up.

Intact: position 1-20 maybe?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to look for the changes in each mutant.

Looking at the first part:

Mutant 1 shows a change from CTC to CTA? Wait, maybe not. Let me think: the original is ...TTTCTCGCTGGTAC...

Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCT...

Wait, wait, perhaps the change is in the third codon. Let me break it down.

Original:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA… 

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CT A GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA… 

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of each position as bases.

Looking at the first part, the intact gene has ...TTTCTCGCTGGTAC... So the sequence is positions 4-8: TTT CTC GCT.

In Mutant 1, perhaps the sequence is ...TTCTACGCT..., so positions 4-8 changed from TTTCTC to TTCTAC
