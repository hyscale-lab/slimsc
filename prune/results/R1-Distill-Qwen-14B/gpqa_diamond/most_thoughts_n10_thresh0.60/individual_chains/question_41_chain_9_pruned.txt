Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says: A light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. The options are A to D, with some expressions involving n and v.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. The beam is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the observer is in the lab, watching the glass move towards them, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's movement.

I remember that when dealing with light in moving media, things get a bit tricky because of special relativity, but wait, the glass is a material medium, not something moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, no, wait. The problem states that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so perhaps we're using units where c=1, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed of light is 1/n, assuming c is 1. But that's in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass is moving with velocity v in the lab frame. So I think we need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab, considering the glass's motion.

But how do we combine the velocities here? Relativity comes into play when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, but here, the glass is moving at velocity v, which isn't specified to be relativistic. Wait, but the problem asks about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So maybe it's a question of relative velocities.

Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v1 = 1/n. But the glass is moving at v in the lab frame. So how do we find the speed of the light in the lab frame?

Wait, no. Because the light's velocity isn't just the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass. Because velocities don't simply add up in relativity unless it's non-relativistic. But the problem states that c=1, implying special relativity units, but perhaps the velocities
