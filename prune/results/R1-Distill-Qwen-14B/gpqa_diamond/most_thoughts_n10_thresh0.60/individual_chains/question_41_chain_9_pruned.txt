Okay, let me try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium relative to an observer in the lab. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity and the properties of light.

Wait, the glass has an index of refraction n, and it's moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the laboratory, and the glass is moving towards them. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, but since the light is towards the observer, maybe the motion is towards the observer's side?

Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer. So imagine the light is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the light, meaning the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the light is in the glass, which itself is moving towards the observer.

I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame. I know that in a medium at rest, the speed of light is c/n. But when the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed?

Wait a second, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity of an object in one frame is not simply the sum of velocities. The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)). But wait, is this applicable here?

Hold on, the glass medium is moving,
