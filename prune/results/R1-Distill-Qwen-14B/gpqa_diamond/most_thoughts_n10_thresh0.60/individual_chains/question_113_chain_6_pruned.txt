Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. The broad peak around 3000 wavenumbers suggests the presence of O-H groups, probably from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have very strong, broad O-H stretches around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But the peak here is very broadâ€”I think that's more indicative of an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H. Oh, wait, maybe it's from an -NH group, but the question says the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are probably CH2=CH. So maybe not amides or amines, but an alcohol or another O-H containing compound.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which usually indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. Could that be an aromatic ring with C=C stretching? Or maybe an amide? Wait, but earlier we thought it's an O-H, so maybe the 1650 is another carbonyl, like an ester (which typically have two peaks around 1700 and 1650 due to C=O and maybe conjugated groups). Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. For example, in an alpha-beta unsaturated ketone, the carbonyl might appear around 1700, and the conjugated double bond around 1650.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum. It has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are typically in the range of 4.5-7 ppm, as they are next to a double bond. So the structure probably has a double bond, maybe part of an ester group or another structure with a conjugated double bond. Also, if there are vinyl hydrogens, maybe the compound is something like an ester with a conjugated double bond, like an alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Then, looking at the mass spectrum,
