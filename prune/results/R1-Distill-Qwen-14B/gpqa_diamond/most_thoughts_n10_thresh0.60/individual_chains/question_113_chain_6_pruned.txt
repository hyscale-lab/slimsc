Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the chemical formula among the options given. Let's look at each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a very broad peak, maybe it's from an -OH group. Also, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Oh, those are important. The 1700 is often a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, or perhaps conjugated groups. Wait, sometimes if there's a C=O and maybe a conjugated double bond, like in a carbonyl adjacent to a double bond, the peak could be lower. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. But wait, FTIR can sometimes show peaks for conjugated systems. So maybe there's an ester or a ketone and some conjugated double bonds?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, right? So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere. So maybe an alkene or an aromatic ring? But wait, no, aromatic protons are usually in a different region. Vinyl protons are typically around 4.5-7 ppm as doublets or something.

Then, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments give m/z 45? Let me think. The molecular ion could break into smaller ions. 45 is a common mass because it's the mass of CH3CO (which is 45: C=12, H3=3, O=16; 12+3+16=31? Wait, no, wait. Wait, molecular weight of CH3CO is 45? Wait, molecular formula for CH3CO is C2H3O. Wait, wait, no, CH3
