Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem talks about two mixtures, X and Y, and then a hydrocarbon Z. So, let's break it down.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Wait, decolorizing bromine water usually means they can undergo an addition reaction, right? Like alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated compounds. Oh, but the problem says there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X's compounds. Hmm, so maybe they are something like alkenes but without conjugation, or perhaps they are something else.

Now, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. Oh, and this leads to a disproportionation reaction, forming mixture Y. Y is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. So Y's components are less reactive towards bromine. Or maybe they don't have the same functional groups as X's.

Then, both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z is a solvent and doesn't react further with hydrogen. Also, Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let me calculate what that is. 14.28% is approximately 1/7, since 1/7 is about 14.29%. So, the hydrogen percentage is 1/7 of the molecule's mass.

Hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds. So if X and Y have unsaturated bonds, their hydrogenation would saturate them. But since Z is a hydrocarbon, and the same for both X and Y, maybe X and Y are different dienes or something that upon hydrogenation give the same product.

Wait, but X and Y are different mixtures, but hydrogenation of both leads to the same Z. So perhaps X and Y are different pairs that, when hydrogenated, lead to the same product. For example, maybe X is something like 1-butene and another diene, and Y is a different pair, but when hydrogenated, all become the same Z.

But let's think about Z: its hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. Let's compute the molecular formula. Let's say the formula is CnHm. The percentage of H is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28. Let's approximate 14.28 as 1/7, so 1/7 = m/(12n + m). Cross-multiplied: 12n + m = 7m → 12n = 6m → 2n = m. So m=2n.

So the hydrocarbon is of the form CnH2n. That suggests it's an alkene or alkane? Wait, no. Alkanes are CnH2n+2, alkenes are CnH2n. Oh, wait, but if Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, that implies that all unsaturated bonds are saturated. So Z must be an alkane, because alkenes would react with hydrogen (under certain conditions). So wait, but Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene. Hmm, but if after hydrogenation, alkenes become alkanes. Wait, no, perhaps I got it wrong.

Wait, the hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. So X and Y must have unsaturated bonds. For example, if X and Y are alkenes, their hydrogenation would give alkanes. But Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene. That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps Z is an alkane, which means when X and Y are hydrogenated, alkenes become alkanes. But then Z would be CnH2n+2.

Wait, let me double-check the math for Z. The hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, so
