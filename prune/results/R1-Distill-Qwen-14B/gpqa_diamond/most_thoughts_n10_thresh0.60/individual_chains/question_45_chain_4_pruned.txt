Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for the system. The options are all combinations of multiples of E, which is given as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²). So each particle's energy is quantized based on their quantum number.

Wait, right. For a single particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are E_n = (n²) * E, where E is as given. So the first particle (n=1) has energy E, n=2 has 4E, n=3 is 9E, n=4 is 16E, etc.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they're fermions. So the Pauli exclusion principle applies. In a 1D well, particles are only distinguished by their quantum numbers and spin. Since spin is 1/2, each state can have two particles with opposite spins.

So in the ground state, we need to place all four particles in the lowest possible energy states without violating the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think. Each energy level can hold two particles (since spin up and spin down). So the first energy level (n=1) can hold two, the second (n=2) another two. But wait, wait, no. Wait, no, each n level is a single
