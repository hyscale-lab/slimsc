Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that the harmonic oscillator is a standard problem in quantum mechanics. The potential is like a 3D version of the 1D oscillator, but in all directions, so it's isotropic.

The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue.

Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, each state is characterized by a set of quantum numbers. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, no, actually, in three dimensions, the energy levels are the same as the sum of the individual 1D energies.

In the 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because the energy in 1D is (
