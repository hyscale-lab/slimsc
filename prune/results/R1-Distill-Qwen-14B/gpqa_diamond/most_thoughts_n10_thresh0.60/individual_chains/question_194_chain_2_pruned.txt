Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Let's see, the spins are S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, and I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because β is 1/(kT), so it's like each state contributes a Boltzmann factor based on its energy.

So the first step is to figure out all the possible states of the system. Each spin has two possible values, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

But wait, maybe it's easier to find the energies for each state and then sum the corresponding Boltzmann factors.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way than writing out all 8 states. Let's think about the energy expression. The energy E is -J times the sum of all pairwise products. So E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let me compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state. Alternatively, perhaps I can find how many states have a particular value of this sum.

What values can the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 take? Let's think about possible cases based on the number of spins in the same state.

Wait, let me think about this. Each S_i is either +1 or -1. So S_i S_j is +1 if S_i and S_j are the same, else -1.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is the sum of three terms, each either +1 or -1. So the maximum possible sum is 3 (all three terms +1), and the minimum is -3 (all three -1). But wait, can all three terms be -1? Let's see: For S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. What does that mean for the spins?

If S1S2 = -1, then S1 and S2 are opposite. Similarly, S1S3=-1
