Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, let's see. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. The question is asking for the energy levels, and there are four options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials, especially in two dimensions, it's helpful to consider the separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation. So maybe I should try to express the potential in terms that allow me to separate the equation into radial and angular parts.

Let me think about the potential. It's given in polar coordinates, which makes sense for a two-dimensional problem. The potential V(r, θ) has two terms: the first is (1/2)k r², which looks harmonic in r. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Cos²θ can be rewritten using a double-angle identity, right? Because cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me calculate that: (3/2)*(1/2)=3/4, so it's (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). 

So the entire potential becomes V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos2θ). Let's distribute that: (1/2 + 3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Calculating 1/2 + 3/4 gives 5/4. So V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the math. The original V is (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Expanding cos²θ: (3/2)k r²*(1/2 + cos2θ/2) = (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. So adding to the first term: (1/2 + 3/4)k r² = (5/4)k r². So yes, the potential is (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait—maybe I should think in terms of effective potentials or perhaps a shifted coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of separate angular and radial parts in a way that the Schrödinger equation can be solved by separation of variables.

Wait, the potential has terms in r² and r² cos2θ. Let me see. In cylindrical coordinates, we can perhaps separate the equation. Alternatively, maybe it's better to switch to a different angular variable. Let me think—since there's a cos2θ term, that suggests a potential that varies with 2θ, so the angular part might involve a double angle.

But maybe I can try to write the potential as a sum of a function of r only and another function that depends on cos2θ and r². Let me see: V(r,θ) = [5/4 k r²] + [3/4 k r² cos2θ]. So, perhaps this can be considered as a sum of two separate potentials, each involving r and an angular component.

Wait, but when solving the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates, the approach is to separate the equation into radial and angular parts. So let me write the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this potential.

The Schrödinger equation in two dimensions (polar coordinates) is:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) (∇²) ] ψ(r,θ) + V(r,θ) ψ(r,θ) = E ψ(r,θ).

Expanding the Laplacian in polar coordinates, it's (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²ψ/∂θ². So:

- (ℏ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) + (1/r²) ∂²ψ/∂θ² ] + [ (5/4 k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ ) ] ψ = E ψ.

To separate variables, we can assume ψ(r, θ) = R(r) Θ(θ). Substituting this in, we get:

- (ℏ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) R' (r Θ') + (1/r²) R Θ'' ] + [ (5/4 k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ ) R Θ ] = E R Θ.

Dividing both sides by R Θ gives:

- (ℏ²/(2m)) [ (1/(r R)) (dR/dr) (r dΘ/dθ) + (1/(r² R)) Θ'' ] + [ (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) ] = E.

Let me rearrange terms:

- (ℏ²/(2m r R)) (dR/dr) (r dΘ/dθ) - (ℏ²/(2m r² R)) (Θ'' ) + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) = E.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can manipulate it to separate into radial and angular parts. Let's try to group terms involving Θ and R.

Let me factor out 1/(r R) from the first term and 1/(r² R) from the second:

[- (ℏ²/(2m r R)) (r dR/dr) (dΘ/dθ) ) - (ℏ²/(2m r² R)) Θ'' ] + (5/4 k r² R Θ + 3/4 k r² R Θ cos2θ ) = E R Θ.

Wait, maybe it's better to write this as:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) (dR/dr) (r dΘ/dθ) )/(R) + (1/r²) (Θ'')/(R) ) ] + (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ) = E.

Hmm. Let me reorganize terms:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) (dR/dr) (r dΘ/dθ) ) / R )  ] + [ (5/4 k r² + 3/4 k r² cos2θ ) ] = [ (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r²) (Θ'' ) / R ) + E ].

Wait, maybe this approach isn't the easiest. Let me think about the potential as two parts: V(r) and V'(r,θ). The first term is (5/4 k r²), which is just a function of r. The second term is (3/4 k r² cos2θ), which depends on both r and theta.

Hmm, but the presence of the cos2θ term complicates things. Maybe I can look for a transformation that can simplify this. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a coordinate substitution to account for the angular dependence.

Wait, another approach: consider that the potential can be expressed as V(r,θ) = V0(r) + V1(r, θ), where V0 is (5/4)k r² and V1 is (3/4)k r² cos2θ. So the total potential is the sum of these two.

But for the Schrödinger equation, if the potential can be written as a sum of a radial part and an angular part, then the equation might separate. Wait, but V1 isn't purely angular because it depends on r² as well. Hmm, that complicates things because it's a product of r² and cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of a shifted radius or some other coordinate. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for certain potentials, the energy levels can be found via the harmonic oscillator approach.

Wait, another thought: the given potential might be expressible as a shifted oscillator. Let me think about the form of the potential. The first term is (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let's see: (1/2)kr² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Wait, I can factor out (1/2)k r² from both terms. So, V = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, perhaps I can write this as (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. And 1 + 3 cos²θ can be rewritten as 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ), using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Wait, let me compute that. 3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2. So 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V = (1/2)k r² [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ] = (5/4)k r² + (3/4) k r² cos2θ. Which matches what I found earlier.

But how does this help me? Well, perhaps the potential can be expressed in terms of two different harmonic potentials in different directions. Alternatively, maybe it's a combination of an isotropic harmonic oscillator and another term that breaks the rotational symmetry.

Wait, another approach: in two dimensions, when the potential has angular dependence in cos(2θ), it's sometimes useful to go into prolate or oblate spheroidal coordinates, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider expanding the potential in terms of angular momentum operators. Because the term with cos2θ suggests that the angular part is related to L_z squared or something like that.

Wait, let's think about the angular part. The cos2θ term can be expressed in terms of e^{i2θ}, which relates to the angular momentum operator. Because L_z = -i ℏ ∂/∂θ, so L_z squared would be -ℏ² ∂²/∂θ², which would produce terms involving cos2θ when acting on certain functions.

Wait, for a function Θ(θ) = e^{i n θ}, L_z Θ = i n ℏ Θ, so L_z^2 Θ = -n² ℏ² Θ. So for Θ(θ) = cosθ, that would relate to n=1. Similarly, cos2θ would relate to n=2.

Wait, perhaps I can use this to rewrite the potential term involving cos2θ in terms of L_z^2. Let me try.

The second term in the potential is (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Since cos2θ = (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ}) / 2, maybe I can express this term in terms of L_z^2. Because L_z^2 would be proportional to (-ℏ²) (d²/dθ²), and for functions like cos2θ, this would give a term proportional to -2² ℏ² cos2θ.

Wait, let me compute L_z^2 acting on cos2θ.

Compute ∂² cos2θ/∂θ²: first derivative is -2 sin2θ, second derivative is -4 cos2θ. So L_z^2 (cos2θ) = (-ℏ²)(-4 cos2θ) )= 4 ℏ² cos2θ.

So cos2θ is an eigenfunction of L_z^2 with eigenvalue 4 ℏ². So perhaps I can write the potential term (3/4 k r² cos2θ) as (3/4 k r²) * [ (L_z^2)/(4 ℏ²) ) ] * (4 ℏ²) ) / something? Hmm, maybe this is the right approach. Let me think.

Wait, if L_z^2 cos2θ = (4 ℏ²) cos2θ, then cos2θ = (1/4 ℏ²) L_z^2 cos2θ. So maybe the term (3/4 k r² cos2θ) can be written as (3/4 k r²) * (1/(4 ℏ²)) L_z^2 cos2θ. But wait, that would tie the potential to the operator, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to absorb the cos2θ term into the angular part of the Hamiltonian.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be rewritten so that the angular part is a multiple of cos2θ, and the radial part is another function. Let me think: So the potential is (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k r²) cos2θ. So the entire potential is V(r,θ) = [ (5/4)k r² ] + [ (3/4)k r² cos2θ ].

So the Schrödinger equation becomes:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) ) + (1/(r²)) ( - L_z^2/(ℏ²) ) ) ] R(r) Θ(θ) + [ (5/4 k r² + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) ) ] R(r) Θ(θ) = E R(r) Θ(θ).

Wait, because L_z = -i ℏ ∂/∂θ, so L_z^2 = -ℏ² ∂²/∂θ². So (1/r²) (d²ψ/dθ²) = (1/r²)(- L_z^2/(ℏ²)) ψ. So the Schrödinger equation when written in terms of R and Θ is:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m)) (1/r) (d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (L_z^2/(ℏ²)) ) + V(r,θ) ] R(r) Θ(θ) = E R(r) Θ(θ).

Hmm, maybe I should collect terms involving L_z^2 and r terms. So:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) ) ) + (5/4 k r²) R(r) ) ] + [ (ℏ²/(2m r²)) L_z^2 + (3/4 k r² cos2θ) ] R(r) Θ(θ) = E R(r) Θ(θ).

Wait, this doesn't look separable as it stands because the second term has a product of R and cos2θ, which depends on θ. So perhaps I need to find a way to write the potential such that it allows the equation to separate into radial and angular parts.

Alternative approach: perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of functions that depend only on r and functions that depend on θ. But the term (5/4 k r²) is a function of r, and the other term is r² cos2θ. The r² cos2θ is a product of r² and cos2θ, which complicates separation.

Wait, unless I can find a substitution or a change of variables that allows me to write the potential as a sum of functions, each of which depends on a combination of variables that can be separated.

Wait, another idea. Let me make a substitution to absorb the angular dependence into the radial part. Let's define a new variable u(θ) = r^2 cos2θ. Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the term involving cos2θ can be written in terms of the angular momentum operator.

Wait, perhaps the potential can be rewritten to include the angular momentum operator. Let's think about it.

The term involving cos2θ is (3/4 k r² cos2θ). Since cos2θ is proportional to (e^{i2θ} + e^{-i2θ})/2, which relates to L_z squared as I thought earlier. Because L_z^2 is proportional to the second derivative with respect to θ, and applying it to e^{i2θ} would give a factor of (2)^2 ℏ^2.

So perhaps the term (3/4 k r² cos2θ) can be written as (3/(4 * 4)) k r² L_z^2/(ℏ²) * (4 ℏ²) )? Wait, earlier I found that L_z^2 (cos2θ) = 4 ℏ² cos2θ. So, cos2θ = (L_z^2)/(4 ℏ²) cos2θ. Hmm, but maybe I can express the potential term as a function involving L_z².

Wait, so cos2θ is an eigenfunction of L_z^2 with eigenvalue 4 ℏ². So, perhaps the potential term (3/4 k r² cos2θ) can be written as (3/4 k r²) * ( (L_z^2) / (4 ℏ²) ) * (4 ℏ²) )? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps if I write the potential term as (3/4 k r² cos2θ) = (3/(4 *4)) k r² (L_z^2) / (ℏ²) ). Because since L_z² cos2θ = 4 ℏ² cos2θ, then cos2θ = L_z^2 cos2θ/(4 ℏ²).

So, substituting into the potential term:

(3/4 k r² cos2θ) = (3/4 k r²) * (L_z^2 cos2θ)/(4 ℏ²) ) = (3 k r² L_z^2 cos2θ)/(16 ℏ²).

Wait, but that seems a bit circular because we're expressing cos2θ in terms of L_z² acting on it, which might not directly help in solving the Schrödinger equation.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the potential can be written as a sum of functions that allow the Schrödinger equation to separate into radial and angular parts. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to shift the potential so that the angular part becomes a harmonic oscillator in terms of the angular variable.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential can be seen as a sum of two harmonic potentials in different directions. For example, in polar coordinates, certain potentials can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates through a rotation.

Wait, let me think. The potential is V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. 

Wait, cos2θ can be written as (x² - y²)/r², where x and y are Cartesian coordinates. Because x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, so x² = r² cos²θ, y² = r² sin²θ, so x² - y² = r² (cos²θ - sin²θ) = r² cos2θ. So cos2θ = (x² - y²)/r².

Substituting that into the potential, V = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² * (x² - y²)/r². Simplifying, that becomes (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k (x² - y²).

So V = (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k x²) - (3/4 k y²). Hmm, that's interesting. Wait, let me write this as V = (5/4 k r²) + (3/4 k x²) - (3/4 k y²). 

Wait, but r² is x² + y². So substituting that in, V = (5/4 k (x² + y²)) + (3/4 k x²) - (3/4 k y²). Let's expand this.

5/4 k x² + 5/4 k y² + 3/4 k x² - 3/4 k y².

Combine like terms:

(5/4 + 3/4) k x² = (8/4) k x² = 2 k x².

(5/4 - 3/4) k y² = (2/4)k y² = (1/2)k y².

So the potential V becomes 2k x² + (1/2) k y². Oh, wait, that's a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator but with different frequencies in x and y directions. Because in the x-direction, the coefficient is 2k and in y it's (1/2)k.

Wait, that's a key insight! So the original potential in polar coordinates is equivalent to a harmonic oscillator in Cartesian coordinates with different frequencies in x and y. Because harmonic oscillators in different directions have their own quantum numbers and energy levels.

So, if I can model this as a 2D harmonic oscillator with frequencies ω_x and ω_y, then the energy levels would be the sum of the individual quantum numbers times their respective energies.

But wait, what's the relation between the potential coefficients and the angular frequencies? The standard harmonic oscillator potential in x is (1/2) m ω_x² x². So our potential in x is 2k x², which implies (1/2) m ω_x² = 2k. Solving for ω_x: ω_x² = (4k)/(m), so ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m).

Similarly, the y term is (1/2)k y², which implies (1/2) m ω_y² = (1/2)k. So ω_y² = k/m, so ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Now, for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x + (n_y + 1/2) ħ ω_y, where n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers in each direction (0,1,2,...).

Substituting the ω values:

E = (n_x + 1/2) ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ * sqrt(k/m).

Simplify:

E = 2(n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m) + (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Factor out ħ sqrt(k/m):

E = [ 2(n_x + 1/2) + (n_y + 1/2) ] ħ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding the terms inside:

= [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ħ sqrt(k/m)
= (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Wait, looking at the options provided, option C says E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ*sqrt(k/m), which matches what I just found. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, let me double-check. The potential in x is 2k x², so the effective frequency is higher. The energy for each direction is (n + 1/2)ħω. So for x: (n_x + 1/2)* ħ * 2 sqrt(k/m), and for y: (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m). Adding them gives:

E = [ (2n_x + 1) + (n_y + 1/2) ] * ħ sqrt(k/m) ?

Wait, no, let me recalculate:

Wait, for x:

E_x = (n_x + 1/2) ħ ω_x
= (n_x + 1/2) ħ (2 sqrt(k/m))
= 2 (n_x + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m)

Similarly, E_y = (n_y + 1/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

So E_total = E_x + E_y = [2(n_x +1/2) + (n_y +1/2)] ħ sqrt(k/m).

Expanding the terms:

= [2n_x +1 + n_y + 1/2 ] ħ sqrt(k/m)
= (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ħ sqrt(k/m).

Yes, that's correct. So the energy spectrum is E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m), which is option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Potential Simplification**:  
   The potential is rewritten using the trigonometric identity \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2} \). Substituting this into the potential gives:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{5}{4}kr^2 + \frac{3}{4}kr^2 \cos 2\theta.
   \]

2. **Coordinate Transformation**:  
   The term \( \cos 2\theta \) is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as \( \cos 2\theta = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \), where \( x = r\cos\theta \) and \( y = r\sin\theta \). Substituting this into the potential yields:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator with different spring constants in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

3. **Angular Frequencies**:  
   The angular frequencies for the harmonic oscillator are determined from the potential coefficients. For the \( x \)-direction, \( \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \), and for the \( y \)-direction, \( \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \).

4. **Energy Levels**:  
   For a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E = \left(n_x + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_x + \left(n_y + \frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega_y,
   \]  
   where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are the quantum numbers in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively. Substituting \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \), the energy becomes:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy expression with the given options, the correct match is:  
   \[
   E = \left(2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to **Option C**.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
