Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography and interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The question gives me the interatomic distance, which I think is the lattice parameter a. Wait, no, wait—the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, no, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are the same length, right? So the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms. And all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees each.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by 1/d² = (1/a²)(h² + k² + l² - hk( cos α + cos β + cos γ )) divided by (1 + something), wait, no. Wait, no, the general formula for d in a rhombohedral system is a bit different. Oh right, the formula is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l² - hk( cos α ) - hk( cos β ) - hl( cos γ )) / a², but wait, wait, no. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the angles are all the same, α=β=γ=θ. So maybe the formula simplifies a bit.

Alternatively, I think another approach is to use the relation for the interplanar distance in terms of the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. The formula for d is d = a / (sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) ( cosθ )) ), where θ is the angle between the axes. Let me make sure I remember this correctly.

Wait, the general formula for d in a crystal is d = a/(sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - ( hk*cos α + hk*cos β + ... ) )) ), but in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so α=β=γ=30 degrees. So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk (cos α) - hl (cos α) - kl (cos alpha) ) ). Since all the angles are the same
