Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, interplanar distances are important for things like X-ray diffraction, but I'm not exactly sure about the formulas right now. Let me think through this.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, wait, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are equal and all the angles between them are the same, right? So that's why a, b, c are equal here. Let me denote them as a = b = c = 10 Angstrom.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... )) but wait, no, that's for cubic systems. Oh wait, wait, wait. The general formula for d in any crystal system is 1/d² = (h²)/(a²) + (k² sin²α)/(b²) + (l² sin²β cos²θ)/(c²), but that seems complicated. Or wait, maybe it's better to use the formula involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the angles.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + ( ... something with angles ... ) No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. Oh right, for a general hexagonal or rhombohedral system, the formula involves the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Alternatively, the general formula is:

d = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) + ... ) wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula that includes the cos terms of the angles.

Wait, I think the correct formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos gamma)/(a²) ) ?

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I remember that in a rhombohedral system, since all a, b, c are equal and all angles are equal (gamma, alpha, beta), the formula simplifies.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for a general rhombohedral lattice. The general
