Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, right? It's about finding the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using something called the Bragg equation, but wait, isn't that for diffraction? Oh right, the interplanar distance (d) can be found using the formula derived from the structure factor. For a cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but wait, that's for a cubic crystal. But here, it's rhombohedral, which is a special case. Oh right, in a rhombohedral system, all the lattice parameters are the same, a, but the angles between them are equal and not necessarily 90 degrees.

So the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - (hk + hl + kl)/(a² cos² α), where α is the angle between the lattice vectors. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing something up. Let me think. Oh right, for a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more involved.

Alternatively, I remember that the interplanar distance can be found using the formula: d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl)(cos α) )? No, wait, no. I think the correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait, is that right? Or is it divided by something else?

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d² = (a²) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Wait, let me think again. I think the formula is d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) ) ?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me recall the Miller indices and the formula. Oh wait, for a cubic crystal, it's straightforward, but rh
