Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices of the plane. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Oh right, rhombohedral means all edges are equal, and all angles are the same, which in this case are 30 degrees each.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, so that's the lattice parameter 'a' right? Because in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be 'a', but rhombohedral is more complex. Or wait, in a rhombohedral unit cell, the lattice parameter 'a' is the length of the edge of the rhombohedron. Since all edges are equal, a is the same in all directions.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. So I need to calculate the interplanar spacing d for the (111) plane. The formula I remember is something like d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ ) )

Wait, but wait a minute. The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² ( (sin β sin γ )/(sin α) )) + (k² ( (sin α sin γ )/(sin β) )) + (l² ( (sin α sin β )/(sin γ) )) ) )

Wait, no, that's for orthorhombic systems maybe. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, another approach. Oh right, for a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by:

1/d² = (h² +k² + l²)/(a²) - (2 hk cos α + 2 hl cos β + 2 kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, no, wait. Another formula I recall is using the reciprocal of the structure factor, but perhaps it's better to think about the general formula for d-spacing.

Alternatively, the general formula is:

d_{hkl} = (a² ( sin² α +
