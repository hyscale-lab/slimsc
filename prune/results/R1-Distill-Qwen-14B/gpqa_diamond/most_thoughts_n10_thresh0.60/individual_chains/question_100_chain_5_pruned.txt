Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see... the problem describes a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, I remember that C3H6 is propene or maybe cyclopropane? Wait, no, cyclopropane is C3H6 as well, but propene is more common in such reactions. Propene is an alkene, right?

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh wait, that's a typical bromination condition for alkenes. So propene (A) would undergo bromination to add a bromine across the double bond. So A is propene, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as B? Wait, no, wait. Wait, propene is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 across the double bond would give CH2BrCHBrCH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane. So compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base, so this is likely an elimination reaction. When a dibromide reacts with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it can eliminate two equivalents of HBr. So, in this case, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with KOH (alcohol), it would eliminate HBr
