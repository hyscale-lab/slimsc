Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about two reactions where a chemist uses different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)- and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Hmm, I need to find out what starting materials A and B are.

Wait, the products are enantiomers, right? Because one is R and the other is S. So the reactions must have led to the formation of opposite configurations at the stereocenter. That makes me think about the reducing agents used. Oh right, the first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+, and the second uses BH3 and H+. I remember that different borohydrides can affect the stereochemistry of the product, especially in ketone reductions.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait, in ketone reductions, the usual scenario is that BH3 is a stronger reducing agent than LiBH4, but that's in certain contexts. Alternatively, maybe they're talking about the conditions for the reduction of an epoxide or something else. Wait, but the product is a pyranone. Oh wait, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, and the reducing agents are leading to different ring openings.

Wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring with an
