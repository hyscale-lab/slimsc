Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is given as Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row (0, -i) and the second row (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which of the given statements (A to D) is correct.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the components have specific commutation relations, but since this is about a specific component, maybe I can approach this directly. Let's start by writing down the matrix S.

Wait, S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And Ay = c * S, so substituting c = h/(4π), the matrix becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So Ay is:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λ I) = 0.

Matrix Ay - λ I is:
[ -λ, (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π)), -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) = -i² = -( -1 ) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - (h²/(4π)^2)*1 = 0.

So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π)

Wait, but hold on. The eigenvalues are ±h/(4π)? But wait, that would make the eigenvalues real. But wait, the matrix Ay is Hermitian, right? Because S is Hermitian? Let me check.

S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

The conjugate transpose of S would be:

[ 0    i ]
[ -i    0 ]

Which is the same as S. Because the (1,2) element is -i, its conjugate is i, but the (2,1) element is i, which becomes -i when transposed. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: For S to be Hermitian, S† = S. So the (1,2) element is -i, so its conjugate is i. The (2,1) element is i, so in S†, the (1,2) element would be i. But in S, (2,1) is i. So S† would have (2,1) as i? Wait, no, when you take the conjugate transpose, the (1,2) becomes (2,1), and if S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then S† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not equal to S. So S is anti-Hermitian? Or perhaps not. Wait, S is the Pauli Y matrix, right? Because the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and I know that the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Because σy† = σy. Let me compute S†:

σy† is the conjugate transpose. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], and transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Transposing gives [[0, i], [-i, 0]]. Then, taking the conjugate, becomes [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is the original S. So S is Hermitian. So Ay = c S, and c is a real constant, so Ay is also Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues should be real, which matches what I found earlier.

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). So statement A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh or ±... Wait, no. Statement A says the imaginary part is ±2πh or something, but I just found the eigenvalues are real. So statement A must be incorrect because it suggests that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which they don't.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im eigenvalue are ±2πh or ..., but my eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Doesn't match. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Hmm. Wait, the square of the angular momentum operator (A^2) commutes with all components, so the eigenfunctions of A^2 are simultaneous eigenfunctions of any component. But since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions won't be the same. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, is it also an eigenfunction of A^2? Hmm, A² is the Casimir operator, which commutes with all components. So if you have an eigenstate of Ay, it's also an eigenstate of A² because they commute. But it won't be an eigenstate of Az unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate, which isn't guaranteed. So option C says the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. That seems correct because A² and Ay commute, but Ay and Az don't. So φ is an eigenstate of Ay, so it must be an eigenstate of A² as well. So C is correct?

Wait, but why can't the eigenfunction of Ay be an eigenfunction of Az? Because [Ay, Az] = iħ A something, implying they don't commute. So it's not possible for a state to be an eigenstate of both unless it's a simultaneous eigenstate. But in general, for a state to be an eigenstate of one component, it's not necessarily an eigenstate of another component unless they commute. So, yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not necessarily eigenfunctions of Az, but they are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of Ay. I'm not sure what this means. The basis functions of the matrix operator? Well, the matrix is 2x2, so the basis is two-dimensional. The eigenvectors of Ay form a basis, but whether they are the basis functions of the operator... I'm not certain. Alternatively, any operator's eigenfunctions can form a basis for the space, so the eigenfunctions form a basis. But D's statement is a bit ambiguous. Maybe D is incorrect if it implies they are the only basis functions, but any basis would work.

So, looking back, the correct statements from the options are option C.

Wait, but let's make sure. The question asks, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, another way: for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of Ay are spin-up and spin-down along y. These states are eigenstates of A², because A² is s(s+1)ħ², which is (1/2)(3/2)ħ². So for each state, the eigenvalue of A² is same, so they are eigenfunctions. But for Az, the eigenstates are different. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not necessarily of Az. So option C is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

So that's correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), which is given as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting \( c \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues of \( A_y \), we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - \lambda I) = 0 \). The matrix \( A_y - \lambda I \) is:

\[
A_y - \lambda I = \begin{bmatrix} -\lambda & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & -\lambda \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - \lambda I) = (-\lambda)(-\lambda) - \left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = \lambda^2 - \left(\frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}\right).
\]

Setting this equal to zero gives:

\[
\lambda^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. This eliminates options A and B, as they incorrectly suggest the eigenvalues have imaginary parts.

Next, we consider option C: "The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the Z-component, \( A_z \)." The operator \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator of the angular momentum, which commutes with all components of \( \mathbf{A} \), including \( A_y \). Therefore, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so an eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is generally not an eigenfunction of \( A_z \). This makes option C correct.

Finally, option D states: "The eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \)." While the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the two-dimensional space, the phrasing of this option is ambiguous and does not necessarily hold as the "basis functions" of the operator. Thus, option D is incorrect.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
