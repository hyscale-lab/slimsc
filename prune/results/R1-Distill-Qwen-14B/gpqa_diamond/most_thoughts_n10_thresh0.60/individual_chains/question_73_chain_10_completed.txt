Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity, but I'll try to think it through. So, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, we can't just add them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for adding velocities is different. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Wait, but wait, since both are moving in the same direction, v_rel should be the difference between their speeds divided by 1 minus their product over c squared. So, v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. Let me plug those numbers in.

Calculating the numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c². Let's compute that. (0.3c²)/c² is 0.3. So 1 - 0.3 is 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Wait, that's approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, C and D have v_rel as 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut is a relativistic mass, so their energies should be their rest mass energy multiplied by gamma (γ).

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So I'll calculate gamma for each.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. Then v²/c² = (0.36)c²/c² = 0.36. So 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * m_rest * c². His mass is 2m, so 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: v=0.5c. v²/c² = 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660, so gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

His mass is 3m, so energy is 3m * 1.1547 c². Let's compute that: 3 * 1.1547 is approximately 3.464. So 3.464 m c².

Adding both energies: 2.5 + 3.464 = approx 5.964 m c².

So the total energy is about 5.96 m c². Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c. Option D has E=5mc² which is way lower. So option C must be the right choice.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity. So yes, 0.6c minus 0.5c is 0.1c, and the denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 0.7, so 0.1/0.7 is about 0.1428, which is 0.14c. So the relative speed part matches option C.

So the correct answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**: \(v_1 - v_2 = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c\)
2. **Denominator**: \(1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\).

1. **First astronaut** (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
   \]
   \[
   E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
   \]

2. **Second astronaut** (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
   \]
   \[
   E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
   \]

3. **Total Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
   \]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
