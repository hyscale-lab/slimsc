Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which statement is correct regarding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let's take it step by step.

First, the problem says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, I think I remember that spin matrices for particles like electrons or muons (which is what the question is about) are related to Pauli matrices. The Pauli Y matrix is usually represented as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh yeah, so S must be the Pauli Y matrix here. 

So, A_y is (h/(4π)) multiplied by the Pauli Y matrix. The eigenvalue equation given is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Let's think about the general approach for finding eigenvalues of a matrix. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

But wait, A_y is (h/(4π)) times S. So, A_y = (h/(4π)) S. Since S is the Pauli matrix, its eigenvalues are known. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So, S has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, A_y should have eigenvalues ± (h/(4π)) * 1. So the eigenvalues a would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me double-check. The Pauli Y matrix S has eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by c = h/(4π), the eigenvalues become c*(±1) → ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But looking at the options, I don't see any option that directly matches this. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Hmm. But wait, the
