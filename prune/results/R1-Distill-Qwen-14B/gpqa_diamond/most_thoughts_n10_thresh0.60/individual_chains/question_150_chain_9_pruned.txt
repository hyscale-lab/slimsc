Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's asking. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, I need to figure out the structure based on the NMR data and then determine what happens when it reacts with certain reagents.

The NMR data is given as:
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each of these signals.

Starting with the 9.72 ppm peak. That's a triplet, integrating to 1H. A triplet around 9-10 ppm usually suggests an aldehyde proton because the aldehyde proton is deshielded and appears around there. Wait, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be another type of proton, but likely an aldehyde.

Then, looking at the 6.98 and 6.51 regions. Those are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those could be aromatic protons. Let's think about substitution patterns. For example, if there are two aromatic rings each with a substituent, maybe para-substituted.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like hydroxyl protons, but waitâ€”it's a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's an olefinic (alkene) proton. But wait, the integration is 2H, which is a bit confusing because olefinic protons are usually in doublets or triplets. If it's a singlet, maybe it's part of a conjugated diene or something like that. Alternatively, maybe these are protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a hemiacetal or something, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet integrating to 2H. That seems like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group or something like that. The fact that it's a doublet suggests coupling to another proton. So perhaps it's a CH2 where each proton is coupled to a neighboring group.

Putting this together. Let's see. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So 2*8 +2 =18; 18 -9=9; 9 -1 (from N) =8; 8 +1 (from O) =9; wait, wait. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, the formula is (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2. Let me compute that again.

Wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is
