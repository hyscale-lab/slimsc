Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the power of 5. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, so plx is in arcseconds, and the distance d is in parsecs. So if plx increases, distance decreases, and vice versa.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. So I think I need to express the number of stars (N) in terms of distance (r, which I assume is d) and see what the relationship is.

Given N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but that's the number of stars in the entire region up to distance d. But the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So perhaps it's the density or the rate of stars per unit
