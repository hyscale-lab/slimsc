Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. It involves two reactions, and I need to choose the correct reagents from the options given.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and uses reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with cyanide ions, it's a nucleophilic addition. The first reaction probably involves the addition of CN- to the ketone. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So adding cyanide would form a cyanohydrin. The product looks like 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But the product in the first reaction is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe the structure is different. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, no, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)COCH
