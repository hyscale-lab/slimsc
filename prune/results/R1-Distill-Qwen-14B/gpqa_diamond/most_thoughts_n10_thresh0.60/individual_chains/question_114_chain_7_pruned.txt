Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the given reactions. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone like butan-2-one reacts with something like NaCN, that's probably a nucleophilic addition. Oh, right! The nucleophilic addition to ketones usually involves something like HCN adding across the carbonyl group.

Wait, but waitâ€”NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So in a typical scenario, the ketone would react with HCN. But here, it's NaCN. Oh, maybe the mechanism is similar. So the carbonyl oxygen would get protonated, making it a better electrophile. Then the CN- would attack, right?

Wait, but in the product, I see a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So the reaction is probably a cyanohydrin formation. Cyanohydrin formation: when a ketone reacts with HCN (or a cyanide source) to form a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

So the reagent for that would be HCN, but since it's NaCN, maybe under acidic conditions? Because I recall that H
