Okay, so I have this question about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength. Oh right, the Lyman alpha line is at about 1216 Angstroms. That's in the ultraviolet range, right?

Wait, the question is about absorption. So when a background quasar's light passes through these clouds, the hydrogen absorbs the light at 1216 Angstroms. But how does redshift come into play here?

Redshift (z) affects the observed wavelength. The formula I think is observed wavelength 位 = rest wavelength 位0 * (1+z). So if the cloud is moving away (or the universe is expanding, which causes redshift), the wavelength we observe will be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

But wait, the question is about detecting this absorption with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it. So the absorbed light must shift into the optical range.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. The optical range is roughly 400-700 nm. So I need the redshifted wavelength to be in that range.

So the smallest 位 we can observe (to be in optical) is about 400 nm. Let's plug into the formula. 位 = 1216 * (1+z) >= 400 nm.

Wait, no. Wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed at 1216 Angstrom
