Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is about quantum mechanics, specifically dealing with spin states and operators. Hmm, I remember from my notes that spin states can be represented as vectors, and operators have matrix representations. 

So, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, I think the first step is to normalize this state because probabilities depend on normalization. Right, the state vector needs to have a norm of 1. 

Let me calculate the norm. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component. So for the |up> component, it's (1+i), and for |down>, it's (2-i). The absolute square of (1+i) is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. And for (2-i), it's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the squared norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the actual state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7)|down>. 

Now, the operator whose matrix is A. The elements Aij are hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So, the matrix is 2x2. For a two-level system, the matrix would look like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0      ]

Wait, because if i≠j, which in a 2x2 matrix are the off-diagonal elements. So diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the operator A is actually (hbar/2)(|up><down| + |down><up| ). Hmm, but wait, that's the same as (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Oh right, so A is (hbar/2) σ_x. 

So the operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A. Wait, but A is a spin operator, so its eigenstates would be the eigenstates of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2}, right? Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, with corresponding eigenvectors those.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, but the eigenstates are the basis for measurement. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is diagonal in another basis, and the state |alpha> can be expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, allowing us to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe the operator A is diagonal in the |up> and |down> basis, but no, it's not diagonal. Because A has off-diagonal elements. So I think the correct approach is to find the eigenvalues and eigenstates of A, and then express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates to
