Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. They give the stability constants for the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm. So, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the stability of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably the one with two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is β2=40.

Wait, but wait. Wait, what's the order of the complexes? Usually, the subscripts go from the lowest to highest number of ligands. So β1 is for the monodentate complex, maybe Co(SCN)^+? No, wait, Co^2+ with one SCN- would be CoSCN^+? Or maybe not. Let me think about the charges. Co^2+ with n SCN- would have a charge of 2+ - n*(−1) since SCN- is −1 each. So for n=1, Co(SCN) would be Co^+1. Wait, that can't be right because Co is +2. Oh wait, perhaps the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 -n} ? Because each SCN- is −1, and the Co is +2. So for each ligand, the charge on the complex would be 2+ - n*(−1) = 2 -n+ n? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If it's [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), Co is +2, each SCN- is -1. So the overall charge is 2+ + (n * -1) )= 2 -n. So for n=1, the charge is +1; for n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the β's are for the complexes with 1,2,3,4 SCN- ligands respectively? Wait, but that would mean the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, [Co(SCN)_4]^-2.

But wait, I thought that the dithiocyanato complex is the blue one, which is the tetraammine dithiocyanato or something else. Wait, no, the blue one is the one with two SCN- ligands. I'm a bit confused about the specifics
