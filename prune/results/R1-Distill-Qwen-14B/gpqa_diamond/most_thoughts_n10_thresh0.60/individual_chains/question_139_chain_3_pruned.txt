Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question involves two compounds, A and B, which when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

First, I remember that sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) are often involved in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. But wait, in this case, the products are diketones. Hmm, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Oh right, I think that when an alcohol is treated with something like HCl and nitrous acid (which comes from NaNO2 and HCl), it can form a diazonium salt, but that's typically for aryl groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a Beckmann rearrangement?

Wait, Beckmann rearrangement is when an oxime rearranges in acidic conditions to form a ketone. Oh, right! So if compound A is an alcohol, maybe after some reaction, it forms an oxime which then rearranges. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact steps. Let me think again.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the starting material is a secondary or tertiary alcohol. When a secondary alcohol is treated with nitrous acid, it can form a diazonium salt, which then undergoes some kind of decomposition. Wait, but for the Beckmann rearrangement, the alcohol is converted into
