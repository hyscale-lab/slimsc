Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of angular momentum and matrix operations. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y for a muon. The operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h divided by 4π. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are similar to this structure. Oh wait, yes, S looks like the Pauli Y matrix!

So, first, let's write down what A_y is. The matrix S is:
[ 0, -i ]
[ i, 0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So A_y = c * S. Let me compute that. Multiplying each element by c:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So the matrix becomes:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λI) = 0.

The matrix (A_y - λI) is:
[ -λ, -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π), -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = λ² - [ ( -i * i ) * (h²/(4π)^2) ) ]

Wait, let's compute that term. i * (-i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. Oh wait, no, wait. The term is ( -i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ). So that's (-i)(i) multiplied by (h/(4π))^2.

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the term is 1 * (h²/(4π)^2).

So the determinant equation becomes λ² - [ (h²)/(4π)^2 ) ] = 0.

So λ² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) because (4π)^2 is 16 π². So λ = (h/(4π)) * (1/2) ? No, wait, wait. Wait, sqrt( (h^2)/(16 π^2) ) is h/(4π), because sqrt of h^2 is h, sqrt of 16 pi^2 is 4 pi. So λ = h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Because when you compute the determinant, it's λ² - (h^2)/(16 π²). So λ² equals (h^2)/(16 π²), so λ is plus or minus h/(4π). Because sqrt(h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π), right? Because 4π squared is 16 π², so sqrt(16 π²) is 4π.

Wait, but wait, 4π squared is 16 π², so sqrt of (h²/(16 π²)) is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says the eigenvalues are ±1/2 with real parts ±1. That doesn't match. Option A says imaginary parts are ±2π h? Hmm, but wait, the eigenvalues here are purely real or purely imaginary? Wait, no. Wait, the matrix A_y is (h/(4π)) multiplied by a
