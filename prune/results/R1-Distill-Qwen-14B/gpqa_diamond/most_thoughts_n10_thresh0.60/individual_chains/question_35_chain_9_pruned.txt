Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as Ay = c·S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row (0 -i) and the second row (i 0). So I should probably write down what S looks like.

So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay is (h/(4π)) multiplied by that S matrix.

The problem is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, among the options A to D, which statement is correct.

Wait, eigenvalues of an angular momentum operator. Angular momentum operators have eigenvalues related to ħ (h-bar), which is h/(2π). But here, c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2. Because ħ is h/(2π), so h/(4π) is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Wait, what is S? S looks like the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. Let me think: The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The standard Pauli Y matrix is:
[ 0
