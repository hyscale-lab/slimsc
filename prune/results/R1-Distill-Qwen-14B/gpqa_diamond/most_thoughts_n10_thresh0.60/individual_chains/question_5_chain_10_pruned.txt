Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. We're provided with the components of the operator P in terms of 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, I think. So the components are P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is a matrix. And the direction n is in the x-z plane, which probably means it's a direction that can be described by some angle, maybe theta and phi in spherical coordinates. But since it's in the x-z plane, perhaps phi is zero or something? Or maybe phi is 90 degrees. Hmm, not sure yet.

But the main task is to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. Oh wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin in a particular direction is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the direction vector. So the operator P along direction n would be P · n, which is n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since the direction is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So n has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But wait, the
