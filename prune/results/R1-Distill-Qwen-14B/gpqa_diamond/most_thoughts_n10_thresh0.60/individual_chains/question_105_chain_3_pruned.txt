Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star's radius to produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star. Hmm, I remember that starspots affect the observed brightness when the star rotates, causing dips in the light curve. But wait, the question is about comparing that to an exoplanet transit, which also causes a dip in brightness. So I need to figure out the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots and then find the planetary radius that would cause the same dip.

Alright, let's break it down. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%, so that's 0.2. Each spot is cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, so the spot temperature is 5000 K.

Wait, but how does the brightness variation from spots work? When a spot is on the visible side, it contributes less light than the rest of the star. As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. The total brightness variation would depend on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

I think the change in flux (ΔF) is the area of the spots times the difference in their flux per unit area compared to the rest of the star. The flux from a star's surface is proportional to T^4. So the rest of the star emits F0 = σTeff^4. The spots emit Fs = σ*(Teff - ΔT)^4. Wait, wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spot temp is 6000K -1000K =5000K. So Fs = σ*(5000)^4.

The area of the spots is the filling factor times the total surface area of the star. The star's surface area is 4πRstar². The spots cover 0.2 of one hemisphere. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere (the whole visible area when looking at the star) covered by spots. So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πRstar²
