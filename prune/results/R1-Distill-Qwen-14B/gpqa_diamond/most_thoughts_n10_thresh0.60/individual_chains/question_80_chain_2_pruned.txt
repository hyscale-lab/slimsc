Okay, so I've got this problem where an algorithm takes a DNA sequence as input and gives a numerical output. My goal is to figure out what the algorithm is doing so I can apply it to the given input, ACAGTGACC, and choose the correct answer from the options provided.

Let me look at the examples given to see if I can spot a pattern.

The first example is AGG -> 115. Let's break down AGG. Each letter represents a nucleotide: A, G, G. I know that in DNA, each nucleotide has a corresponding number based on its position in the genetic code, but wait, maybe it's more straightforward. Let me think about the numerical values of each nucleotide. I've heard that sometimes A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4. Alternatively, sometimes it's A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Hmm, but let's test this.

For AGG, using A=1, G=4: 1 + 4 +4 = 9. 9 doesn't equal 115, so that can't be right. Maybe each letter is assigned a different value. Wait, another approach: perhaps each nucleotide is converted to its position in the DNA base pair structure. Or maybe the algorithm uses the sum of each base's position in the alphabet.

Wait, DNA bases are A, T, C, G. The letters correspond to their order in the alphabet. A is the first letter, T is the 20th (since A=1, B=2,..., T
