Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question says racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on either side of a double bond are exchanged. Oh wait, Grubbs is specifically a ring-closing metathesis catalyst, but in some cases, it can do other things too, like cross metathesis or maybe even some ring-opening, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

The starting molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH₃? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH2? Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Oh but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Then, on carbon 3 (the third carbon from the left), there's a methyl group.

Wait, so the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, maybe I should number it. Let me think: pent implies five carbons. So structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the chain is three carbons long, with a methyl on C3. Wait, let me count. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But since it's 3-methyl, that means on the third carbon, which is the one adjacent to the double bond, there's a methyl branch. So the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, because that would make it six carbons. Wait, no, pent is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene:
