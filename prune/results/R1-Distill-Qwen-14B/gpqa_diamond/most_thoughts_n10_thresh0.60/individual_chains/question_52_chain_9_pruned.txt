Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so spots lower the temperature.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They've observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Hmm. So, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 (let's call them N1/N2) is observed to decrease when there are spots. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, when the star has no spots, the ratio is higher than when it has spots. The question is asking for the ratio (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when it has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So, the ratio without spots is higher. So the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots. Which would be a number greater than 1. Because when there are spots, the ratio is lower.

But wait, what determines the ratio of two energy levels in the photosphere? Oh, right, this is about the Boltzmann equation. In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann factor says that the ratio N1/N2 is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So, the energy difference between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

But wait, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So, each spot is presumably cooler than the surrounding photosphere. But when the spots are present, the average temperature of the entire photosphere is lower, right? Because 40% of the surface is at a lower temperature, so the average Teff is 5500 K.

Wait, but in the problem, the effective temperature is given as 5500 K when spots are present. So, I think that the model here is that the star's overall effective temperature is 55
