Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, as 5x10^10. And they want to know the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions. So, the Ca-EDTA complex must be something like CaY^2- or similar. The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A high K means the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

So the problem is about the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex dissociates into Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- (Y^4-). The reaction would look something like CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. The formation constant K is given for the formation of the complex, which I think is K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). Or wait, maybe I should double-check that. Because sometimes formation constants can be a bit confusing with dissociation constants.

Wait, no, the formation constant (Kf) is for the formation of the complex. So the formation reaction is Ca^2+ + Y^4- ↔ CaY^2-, and Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). So the given K is 5e10, which is a very large number, meaning the complex is very stable; it doesn't dissociate much.

But in this problem, we have the concentration of the complex. So the initial concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M. We can assume that the amount of Ca^2+ and Y^4- released is very small, so that [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca^2+] and [Y^4-] are both x, which is the concentration we're looking for.

Wait, but wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1, right? So for every mole of CaY^2- that dissoci
