Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option.

Hmm. I think this is an electrostatics problem involving potential energy. Since all the charges are fixed except the 13th, but wait, no, actually, the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So maybe the system's potential energy is due to the arrangement of these charges.

Wait, but wait. All charges are 2e, right? So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge. So each is +2e or perhaps -2e, but the sign probably doesn't matter for the magnitude of the potential energy.

Now, the system is isolated, so I think we're looking at the electrostatic potential energy between all pairs of charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 is at the same distance from the 13th. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 would be something like (k * q1 * q2) / r.

But also, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of the 12 is fixed at 2m from P, but are they all placed on a sphere of radius 2m? So they're all at the same distance from each other? Or maybe they're arranged in some other configuration. Wait, but the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So each of them is 2m away from P, but the distance between two of them could vary. Hmm, but for the minimum potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves to minimize the potential energy. Oh wait, but the problem says they are constrained, so perhaps they're fixed in place, so their positions are fixed, making the potential energy fixed as well
