Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then it goes through several steps, and we need to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

First, let me break down each step.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, 1. The NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O), so maybe an epoxide? Wait, no, wait. Epoxides typically have C-O-C. Alternatively, 1720 could be an ester or ketone. But in this case, since it's from KOH and a dibromide, perhaps it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons probably. Heating with KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction, forming a double bond. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe it's forming an epoxide? No, epoxides form when two adjacent bromides react, but with a base like KOH, I think it's more about dehydrohalogenation. Or wait, if it's vicinal dihalide, KOH could cause elimination to form an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Wait, the product's IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So maybe it's not an alkene. Hmm. Maybe the reaction is a ring-opening or some kind of formation of a carbonyl group. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product is an epoxide, but wait, epoxides don't have a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone? How would that form from a dibromide?

Wait, maybe it
