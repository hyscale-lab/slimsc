Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, what do I remember about rhombohedral structures?

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, right? So the lattice is cubic in a way, but with all the angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh wait, or wait, no—rhombohedral usually refers to a special case of hexagonal close-packed structures, but I think in this context, it's the cubic system with all edges equal and angles equal but not 90°, which is the rhombohedral system.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms along an edge of the unit cell? So the lattice parameter 'a' would be 10 Angstroms. Because in a cubic system, the edge length a is the distance between two adjacent atoms along one axis. But wait, wait, no. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is a, because each atom is directly at the lattice points. So if it's a rhombohedral structure, which is like a cube but with all angles equal, the unit cell edges are all of length a, which is 10 Angstroms here.

Wait, but wait, in a rhomboh
