Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance formula is involved here. Let me think about what I know.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Ångströms. I think in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameter 'a' is equal to the interatomic distance since it's a cubic-like structure but with all angles equal.

The formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is (a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2lh cos γ)) ). Wait, or is it divided by the square root of that expression? Let me make sure. Oh right, yes, it's d = a / sqrt(...). 

Since all angles are 30 degrees, and the plane is (111), the h, k, l are all 1. So plugging into the formula:

d = a / sqrt(1² + 1² + 1² - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30 - 2*1*1*cos30). 

Wait, let me compute the denominator step by step. 

First, the sum of squares: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Then, the other terms: 2hk cos α is 2*1*1*cos30, same for the others. So all three terms are 2*1*1*cos30°, so 3 times that. 

Wait, cos30° is sqrt(3)/2, which is about 0.866. So each term is 2* (sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3). So each term is sqrt(3). So three terms would be 3*sqrt(3).

Putting it all together, denominator becomes sqrt(3 - 3*sqrt(3)). Oh wait, wait, no. Let me re-express the formula correctly. The denominator inside the square root is:

h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2lh cos γ.

Since all angles are 30°, it's:

3 - 2*(1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30 + 1*1 cos30)
So 3 - 2*3*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

Wait, 2*(each term) is 2* (cos30) for each of the three cross terms. Wait no, each cross term is -2hk cos α, but since α=β=γ=30°, all three cross terms are present. So it's -2hk cos30 -2kl cos30 -2lh cos30. So summing h, k, l all 1, this becomes -2*(1)(1) cos30 *3. Because each of the three terms is -2, and multiplied by cos30 each.

So that's -2 *3 * cos30. Wait, wait, let's compute each term:

-2*(1*1)*cos30 = -2*0.866 ≈ -1.732. But there are three such terms, so total is 3*(-1.732) = -5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 + (-5.196) = 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Wait, that can't be right because the square root of a negative number isn't real. That must mean I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, no. I think I messed up the sign when plugging in the angles. Let me re-express the formula correctly. The formula is:

d
