Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and under what conditions it's valid. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current-voltage characteristics of semiconductor devices, specifically in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. Let me try to think this through.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). I think ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. So, this equation describes the dark current (J) in terms of voltage (V) and those other parameters.

I remember that in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the accumulation of charge near the cathode creates a potential barrier that limits the current. This situation typically occurs when the device is operated under conditions where the electric field isn't strong enough to cause breakdown or where thermal generation of carriers isn't significant.

Now, the question is about the validity of the equation. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which conditions make the Mott-Gurney equation applicable.

Let me recap what I know about each factor:

1. **Single-carrier vs. two-carrier device**: The Mott-Gurney equation, as I remember, applies to single-carrier devices. Because in two-carrier devices, like in p-n junctions, the behavior is different (like theShockley equation for diodes). So any options mentioning two-carrier devices (like option D) are probably incorrect. So D can be dismissed.

2. **Trap-free condition**: Traps in the material can cause carrier trapping, leading to different current-voltage characteristics, like in traps-limited regions. The Mott-Gurney equation assumes that trapping is negligible, so the device should be trap-free. So any option that mentions traps (or doesn't state trap-free) is out. Looking at the options, all seem to mention trap-free except maybe none? Let me check the options again.

Option A says trap-free. Option B also trap-free. Option C doesn't mention traps. So for Mott-Gurney, we need trap-free, so options without that might be invalid. So C might not be correct.

3. **Ohmic vs Schottky contacts**: Ohmic contacts have a negligible barrier, allowing carriers to pass without significant voltage loss. Schottky contacts have a barrier, so they would affect the current. The Mott-Gurney equation, I think, assumes that the contacts are Ohmic. Because if there's a Schottky barrier, the voltage drop across the contact would complicate things, and the equation wouldn't hold as neatly. So any option mentioning Schottky contact (like option C) is likely incorrect.

Option A has Ohmic contact. Option B says no carrier injection barrier. Oh, wait, that means no Schottky barrier. So perhaps that's another way to phrase it. So B is saying no barriers, which aligns with Ohmic conditions.

4. **Drift vs Diffusion current**: The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the current is in the drift-dominated region. Diffusion currents are considered negligible. So if an option says negligible diffusion current, that's a good sign.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Negligible drift current. Wait, no. Wait, no, option A says "negligible drift current"??? Wait, no. Let me read again.

Wait, options:

A) ... with negligible drift current. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the equation is for the drift current, right? So if drift current is negligible, it wouldn't fit. So perhaps I've misread.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: "... negligible drift current." Hmm, that's opposite of what I thought. Because Mott-Gurney is for SCLC, which is when the current is limited by space charge, and it's drift-dominated. So if the option says drift current is negligible, that would be incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me think. The SCLC regime is when the current is limited by the space charge, which occurs when the electric field is such that space charge builds up, creating a potential barrier. This usually happens when the current is in the drift region, where the current is proportional to the electric field. So the Mott-Gurney equation is valid when the current is due to drift (so diffusion is negligible). So the correct option should say "negligible diffusion current" or "diffusion is negligible".

Looking at the options:

Option A: "... negligible drift current." No, that can't be right.

Option B: "... negligible diffusion current." Yes, this is correct. Because in SCLC, the dominant current is drift, so diffusion is negligible.

Option C: "... negligible diffusion current." Hmm, same as B. But option C talks about Schottky contact, which I don't think applies.

So, putting it all together:

The correct conditions are:

- Single-carrier device (so options A, B, C are okay as D is two-carrier)
- Trap-free (so A and B are in, C is out if it doesn't say trap-free)
- Ohmic contact (so A and B are in, C is out)
- Negligible diffusion current (so B is correct since it says "negligible diffusion current", and A says "negligible drift current", which is wrong)

Wait, Option B says: "no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current."

Wait, no carrier injection barrier would imply Ohmic contacts (since Schottky has a barrier). So that's correct.

So, which statements are correct about the validity?

Looking at option B: "trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current."

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, option A says "...Ohmic contact and negligible drift current." But I thought that the drift current is dominant, so negligible diffusion current is right, not drift. So option B seems correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes the Mott-Gurney equation is considered in the regime where the electric field is such that the space charge limits the current, which happens when the device is in a condition where the current is limited by the space charge, which is when the electric field is such that the space charge creates a potential barrier. So this usually happens when the device is under conditions where the current is dominated by drift (so diffusion is negligible). So, the condition is that diffusion is negligible.

So, looking at the options, option B says "negligible diffusion current".

So, the correct statement is option B. So the answer should be B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), is valid under specific conditions. To determine the correct option, the following points are analyzed:

1. **Single-carrier vs. Two-carrier Device**: The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices. Two-carrier devices (e.g., p-n junctions) follow different models, such as the Shockley equation. Thus, any option mentioning a two-carrier device (e.g., option D) is incorrect.

2. **Trap-free Condition**: The equation assumes negligible trapping of charge carriers. Devices with traps exhibit different behavior, such as trap-limited currents. Therefore, options that do not explicitly state "trap-free" (e.g., option C) are less likely to be correct.

3. **Ohmic vs. Schottky Contacts**: The Mott-Gurney equation assumes Ohmic contacts, where there is no significant voltage drop due to carrier injection barriers. Schottky contacts introduce barriers, which complicate the current-voltage relationship. Thus, options mentioning Schottky contacts (e.g., option C) are incorrect.

4. **Drift vs. Diffusion Current**: The equation is derived under the assumption that diffusion currents are negligible, and the current is dominated by drift. Therefore, options stating "negligible drift current" (e.g., option A) are incorrect, while those stating "negligible diffusion current" (e.g., option B) are correct.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Mentions "negligible drift current," which is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation assumes drift currents are dominant.
- **Option B**: States "trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation.
- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which is inconsistent with the equation's assumptions.
- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, which is invalid for the Mott-Gurney equation.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately describes the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid.

Answer: B
