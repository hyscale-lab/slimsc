Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear physics and quantum mechanics. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh right, Pauli statistics come into play here, which means I need to consider the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are A, B, C, D, each showing a transition from the initial state to a different state plus some emitted particle.

Wait, let me break it down. The initial state is 1S0. The 1 here probably refers to the spin multiplicity, right? So 1S0 would have S=0, since 2S+1 = 1 implies S=0. The L is 0 in this case because it's an S state. So the initial angular momentum J is S + L, but since S=0 and L=0, J=0. So the initial state has J=0.

The two nucleons (NN) are in a state with T=0. So T(NN) is 0. Pauli's condition says T = S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, but in the final state, T(NN) is 0. So substituting into Pauli's condition: 0 = S_final + L_final + 1 mod 2. 

Hmm, S_final is the total spin of the NN system in the final state. But wait, the initial state is spin 0. So when they emit a particle X, what happens to their spin? Well, assuming that the emission is via some interaction that conserves angular momentum, the spin and orbital angular momentum might be involved.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the process. The initial state is NN in 1S0 (so S=0, L=0, J=0). They emit a particle X. So the final state is NN plus X. Wait, noâ€”the problem says the NN system emits X, so the final state is NN in some state, plus X
