Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with various distances.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its speed. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma multiplied by the velocity. Or wait, the mean path is gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the lifetime.

But how do I get the lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Γ is the energy width, and the Heisenberg uncertainty says that Γ * tau ≈ ħ. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, I should be careful with units. Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate the lifetime tau using Γ.
2. Find the velocity beta (v/c) of the meson.
3. Calculate gamma, the Lorentz factor.
4. Multiply all together: beta * gamma * c * tau to get the mean decay distance.

Wait, let me clarify each step.

First, the lifetime tau is given by the relation tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, I think the formula is tau =
