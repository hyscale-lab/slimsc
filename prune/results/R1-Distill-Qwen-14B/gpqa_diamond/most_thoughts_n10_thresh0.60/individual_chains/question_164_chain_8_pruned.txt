Okay, I have this astronomy question about binary star systems, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read it again.

So, there are two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the velocities are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. They want the mass of each system as the sum of the two stars.

Wait, so how do I relate the RV amplitudes to the masses? I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures their Doppler shifts as they move toward and away from us. The amplitude of the velocity depends on the mass of the other star and the inclination of the orbit, but since both systems are eclipsing, their orbits are edge-on, so the inclination is 90 degrees, meaning we can use the full amplitude.

I think the formula for the velocity amplitude is something like K = (2Ï€G / P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) ), where M_p is the mass of the companion, M_s is the star's mass, and sin i is 1 because i is 90 degrees. But maybe I'm getting it a bit mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function. The mass function relates the velocity amplitudes to the masses. The formula is f(M) = (M_2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_1 + M_2)^2 ). But since sin i is 1, it simplifies.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate the velocity amplitudes to each other. Let's denote the two stars in system_1 as M1a and M1b, with velocities K1a and K1b. Similarly, M2a and M2b in system_2 have K2a and K2b.

Wait, in a binary system, the two stars orbit each other. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses because the center of
