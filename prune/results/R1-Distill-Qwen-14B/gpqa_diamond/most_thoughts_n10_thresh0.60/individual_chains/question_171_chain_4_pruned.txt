Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, the question is asking me to arrange six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer after the reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Some groups are activating, which means they make the ring more reactive and direct incoming groups to specific positions. Others are deactivating, making the ring less reactive but still directing.

Wait, the substituent's position affects where the bromine adds. So, for each substituent here, I need to figure out if they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are meta directors or para directors.

Let me list out each compound and their substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: So the substituent is a methyl group (-CH3)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ethyl ester group, -COOEt.
3) C6H5-Cl: Substituent is chlorine (-Cl)
4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group (-NO2)
5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl group (-C2H5)
6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group (-COOH)

So each substituent's directing effects:

Methyl (-CH3): It's an activating group because it's an alkyl group. Alkyl groups donate electrons through the inductive effect. So they are activating. And they are ortho/para directors. So when bromine adds, it's more likely to go para to the methyl group.

Wait, but wait. The position? So for a substituent that is an activating, ortho/para-director, the major product is a mix of ortho and para. But in some cases, the para might be more, especially if steric factors are considered.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So for each substituent, which directs more to para?

Let me make a table:

Substituent | Activating/Deactivating | Ortho/Para Directing | Para tendency
--- | --- | --- | ---
-CH3 | Activating | Ortho/para | High para (maybe more than ortho)
-COOC2H5 | Deactivating (ester) | Meta | So substituent is meta director, so para is not the main product. So the product would be mainly meta, so para is minor.
-Cl | Deactivating (but ortho/para) | Ortho/para, but since it's deactivating, maybe para is more? Wait, Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para director. So the incoming group can go ortho or para, but because Cl is electron-withdrawing, the para product might be more favored because the para position is less hindered and perhaps the directing is more.
Wait, but for deactivating groups, the substituent makes the ring less reactive, but in the case of Cl, which is a ortho/para director, the major product is a mix. But when the substituent is strongly deactivating, like nitro, the para product is more because the ortho position is more hindered? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Let me think again.

For each substituent:

1) Methyl (-CH3): Activating, ortho/para. So the major products are ortho and para. But because the methyl group is small, the para product might be more than ortho due to less steric hindrance.

Wait, no, in reality, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para isomer is often the major one when the substituent is activating because the para position is more accessible and less hindered.

Wait, but in some cases, especially with bulky groups, the para product is more. But methyl is not very bulky. So for methyl, the para product might not be the majority. Wait, I'm a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, the question is about the para isomer's weight
