Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's try to work through this step by step.

Alright, let me read the problem again. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The two planets have different masses and radii. Planet1 is more massive (7 Earth masses) and a bit larger (1.7 Earth radii), while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. 

They both induce Doppler shifts on the star's forbidden [OI] line. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. The question is about the equilibrium temperature ratio between the two planets, assuming they have the same albedo.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right! The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), I think. Or wait, maybe it's (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity. Because equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo.

Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio will depend on the square root of (R_star/(2a)) for each planet. Oh wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux received by each planet is proportional to L/(a^2), where a is the planet's orbital radius.

But wait, how do I find the orbital radius of each planet? Oh, because we have the Doppler shifts, which relate to the velocity of the star due to the planet's gravitational pull. The RV method measures the star's velocity as it's pulled by the planet.

The RV shift is related to the velocity of the star. The Doppler shift formula is something like Δλ/λ = v/c. Or, more accurately, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i)/( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ), but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, I remember that the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass and the orbital period and the distance.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But since the planets are much less massive than the star, M_star >> M_planet, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So simplifying, K ≈ ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, we don't know the orbital periods P of the planets. Hmm, but we might not need to because we have the Doppler shifts. Oh wait, the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is K. So the larger the K, the larger the velocity, which relates to the mass and the distance.

Wait, but the problem gives the maximum Doppler shift for each planet. The maximum shift would correspond to when the star is moving directly towards or away from us. So the maximum Doppler shift is Δλ_max = (v/c) * λ. Let me think.

The formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving with velocity v relative to the observer is approximately Δλ/λ ≈ v/c, assuming v is much smaller than c. So here, the problem states the shift is up to 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2, measured at the [OI] line at 6300 Å. So for Planet1:

Δλ1 = 0.03 Å; λ = 6300 Å. So v1 = (Δλ/λ) * c.

Similarly for Planet2: v2 = (0.04/6300) * c.

Wait, but what is c in terms of Å/s? Let me compute v1 and v2.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. Wait, but in terms of Ångströms per second, perhaps I can just use the ratio without calculating exact values.

So v1 = (0.03/6300) * c, and v2 = (0.04/6300) * c. So v2 is (0.04/0.03) = 4/3 times v
