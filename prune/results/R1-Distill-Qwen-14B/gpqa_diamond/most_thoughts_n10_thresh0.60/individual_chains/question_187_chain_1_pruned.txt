Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, let's see. I'm not super familiar with the specifics, but I'll try to work through it.

First, the question says that a star is detectable if it has a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of the listed stars meet this criterion.

I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used with the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The linked info probably explains its capabilities, but since I don't have it, I'll have to think based on what I know.

The key factors here are the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude) because that affects the signal. The exposure time is fixed at 1 hour, so the star's brightness will determine the S/N. Also, the distance affects apparent magnitude, so I'll need to calculate that.

Apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. Wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Right, because the distance modulus is 5*(log10(d) - 1), which is 5 log10(d) -5.

So for each star, I'll compute their apparent V magnitude.

Let's list the options:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) M=15, d=10 pc
d) M=15, d=200 pc
e) M=15, d=5 pc
f) M=15, d=50 pc

I also need to know the apparent magnitudes of Canopus and Polaris to compare. I remember that Canopus is about magnitude 0, maybe around -0.7. Polaris is much dimmer, like around 2 or 3.

Wait, let me get more precise. Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation Carina and is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. I think its apparent magnitude is about -0.7, but I'm not totally sure. Polaris, the North Star, is much fainter. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2. Maybe 1.8 or so, but I'll have to check or recall.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact magnitudes. Canopus: I think it's about magnitude -0.7, but I might be mistaken. Polaris is a bit tricky because it's a variable star. I recall that it's around magnitude 1.8 to 2.1. Let me go with that for now.

Now, the other stars (c, d, e, f) have absolute magnitudes of 15. So I'll calculate their apparent magnitudes based on their distances.

Let's compute each one:

a) Canopus: m ≈ -0.7

b) Polaris: m ≈ 2.0.

c) M=15, d=10 pc.

m = 15 + 5*log10(10) -5 = 15 + 5*(1) -5 = 15 +5-5=15. But wait, that's not right. Distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d/10). So m = M +5 log10(d) -5.

Wait, formula correction: m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. So for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1. So m=15 +5*1 -5 =15+5-5=15. So m=15. That's way too faint, I think.

d) M=15, d=200 pc.

log10(200) is log10(2e2) = log10(2) + 2 ≈ 0.301 + 2 =2.301.

m=15 +5*(2.301) -5 =15 +11.505 -5 =21.505. That's way too faint.

e) M=15, d=5 pc.

log10(5)= ~0.69897.

m=15 +5*(0.69897) -5 → 15 +3.49485 -5 =13.49485. So about 13.5.

f) M=15, d=50 pc.

log10(50)=1.69897.

m=15 +5*(1.69897) -5 →15 +8.49485 -5=
