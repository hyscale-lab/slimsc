Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method is when you look for shifts in a star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting planet. The star moves back and forth, and we detect that Doppler shift.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. So, the key here is comparing the orbital periods of the two planets based on the spectral line shifts observed.

Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. I think the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and the orbital period. Wait, but how exactly? The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * ( (1 AU)^ (1/3) ) / (period)^(1/3) ) ??? Wait, maybe I should think about the actual formula.

Oh right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * (1 / (c * (1 + M_star/M_p)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, but in this problem, the stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets are similar to Neptune, which is much less than the star's mass. So M_p << M_star, so we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular. So the formula simplifies.

K is approximately proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, wait, another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (2π G ) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )
