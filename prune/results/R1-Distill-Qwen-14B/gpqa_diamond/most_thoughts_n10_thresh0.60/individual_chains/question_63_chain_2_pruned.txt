Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The molecule is made of elements X and Y, right? The problem gives me their masses: Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. Oh wait, I remember that in diatomic molecules, the reduced mass is important for rotational and vibrational energy levels. So I think I need to calculate the reduced mass first.

Reduced mass μ is calculated as (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let's plug in the numbers: (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22. That's approximately 1.818 amu. Wait, but to use it in physics equations, I need to convert amu to kilograms. Oh right, 1 amu is about 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 1.818 * 1.6605 is roughly 3.018, so 3.018e-27 kg.

Next, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. The question is asking about the photon absorption needed to switch to the next lowest energy state. Wait, wait, what's the next state after the ground? I guess it's the first excited state. But which part of the model are we considering here? Oh, the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, but the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the rigid rotor model is for pure rotational states, but the non-rigid one allows for bond length changes, so maybe it's considering vibrational energy as well. Hmm, perhaps the model is the same as the coupled vibration-rotation model.

In any case, when a photon is absorbed, it's providing energy to the molecule. The molecule transitions from one state to another. The question is about the momentum of the photon. Since momentum p = h/λ, and for photons, energy E = pc (since E = hf and f = c/λ, so E = hc/λ, and p = E/c = h/(λ)). Wait, no, wait. Photon momentum p is E/c, because E = pc. So E = pc → p = E/c.

But wait, I'm trying to find the momentum of the absorbed photon. So I need to first find the energy difference between the current state and the next state, then compute p as E/c.

Wait, but what's the current state? The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. For vibration, the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0. Alternatively, for rotation, the ground state is J=0, but when considering vibration, maybe the total energy is a combination of both. Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the energy levels for both rotation and vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition only. Because in infrared spectroscopy, photons cause transitions between vibrational states, typically
