Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets can't have just one pole. Like, you can't have a magnet with only a North pole without a South pole, right? They always come in pairs. But in this question's scenario, that's not the case. So, how would Maxwell's equations change?

I think Maxwell's equations have four parts. Let me recall them. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field, Gauss's Law for electricity. The second is about the circulation of the electric field, Faraday's Law of induction. The third is the divergence of the magnetic field, Gauss's Law for magnetism. And the fourth is the circulation of the magnetic field, Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition.

Wait, in our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic charges—no single North or South pole. So the equation is ∇·B = 0. But if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that means magnetic monopoles exist. So I guess the equation that changes is the one related to the divergence of B, because now it wouldn't be zero anymore. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, something like ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

So which Maxwell equation would change? The third one, which is about the divergence of the magnetic field. So that equation is different. But wait, the question is asking which equations are different. Because Maxwell's equations are four, but in this scenario, maybe more than one would change?

Wait, let me think again. The existence of magnetic monopoles affects more than just Gauss's Law for magnetism. Faraday's Law might also change, or Ampère's Law? Oh, wait. Faraday's Law is about the circulation of the electric field and how it's related to the time derivative of the magnetic field. If magnetic charges exist, would that equation change?

Wait, I think Faraday's Law in the presence of magnetic monopoles would also involve a term. I remember that when magnetic monopoles are considered, Maxwell's equations get modified in two places. The Gauss's Law for magnetism (which was ∇·B = 0) becomes ∇·B = ρ
