Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets in a system. 

Alright, so the setup is that there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Wait, so each planet's period is a multiple of the first one's. Let me note that down. Let's say Planet_1 has period P. Then Planet_2 has 2P, Planet_3 has 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P.

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, which simplifies things because albedo affects the amount of reflected light and thus the temperature. So, since the albedos are the same, the only factors we need to consider are the distance from their star and the star's luminosity.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula. Right, the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = [ (L / (16 * π * π * σ) ) * ( (1 - A) / (d^2) ) ]^(1/4)

But wait, no, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, I remember the simplified version where the temperature scales with the inverse square root of the orbital distance. Also, the temperature is inversely proportional to the square
