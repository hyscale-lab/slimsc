Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, wait, what's C3H symmetry again? Oh right, it's a type of molecular symmetry. C3H would mean that the molecule has a three-fold rotational symmetry and a horizontal mirror plane. So, when you rotate it by 120 degrees, it looks the same, and there's a mirror plane that cuts through the molecule horizontally.

The options are four different molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two others with complex names. The options are A, B, C, D in the choices. Let me think about each one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I remember that borate structures are typically trigonal, but wait, triisopropyl borate has three isopropyl groups attached to boron. B is in the center, and each isopropyl is like a substituent. So the structure would be something like (i-Pr)3B. Now, the isopropyl groups are all the same, so rotationally, if you rotate 120 degrees, the molecule should look the same. Also, I think the molecule is symmetric in some way. Wait, but is there a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is flat, like maybe the boron in the center and three substituents arranged in a trigonal planar geometry, then a mirror plane could be through the boron and one of the substituents, but I'm not sure if that's a horizontal mirror plane. Or maybe it's a vertical plane. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is non-planar, but I think it's more planar in this case.

Wait, but triisopropyl borate's structure is [B(iPr)3], which is trigonal planar with three identical substituents. So it should have three-fold rotational symmetry (C3) because rotating 120 degrees would look the same. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane (H)? If the molecule is in a plane, maybe a horizontal mirror plane would coincide with the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Or perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a C3H symmetry because it's planar, and any plane through the center and perpendicular to the
