Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.

Alright, the decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D with various resolutions.

Wait, I remember that when particles decay, the lifetime they experience is their proper lifetime, but when observed, it depends on their speed and the observer's frame. Oh right, time dilation from special relativity. So the observed lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀.

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/mc². Oh wait, E here is the total energy. Since X⁰ is a particle with energy E and mass m, gamma would be E/(m c²). But since the units here are GeV, and c is considered as 1 in these units, I think gamma is just E/m.

Wait, mass is given as 3.41 GeV. Energy is 27 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41 ≈ let me calculate that. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 27 is a bit more. Let's compute 27 divided by 3.41. Let me see: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 8 = 27.28. Oh, wait, 27 is less than 27.28. So 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.918, so gamma is about 7.92.

So the observed lifetime is gamma * tau0. So tau = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.92 * 8 is about 63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but what's the relation between lifetime and the resolution needed? Oh right, the minimum resolution required is the average lifetime multiplied by the velocity of the particle.
