Okay, so I've got this physics problem about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a point r and time t for a charge q that's moving along a trajectory s(t). The problem gives some context about the position vectors and the velocity. The options are four different expressions for V and A.

Wait, I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations. For a point charge, the scalar potential is usually straightforward. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because you have to consider the retarded time.

So the key here is that the fields at time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the retarded time. The retarded time is when the effect of the charge's motion reaches the observer point r at time t. The vector d is from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. So d is r - s(tr), I think.

For the scalar potential V, in the static case (like when the charge is stationary), it's (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between the charge and the point. But when the charge is moving, things change because of the relativity of simultaneity. The scalar potential would then depend on the charge's position at the retarded time tr.

Wait, but wait— no, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just the static potential with r replaced by the distance at tr. Because when the charge is moving, the potential can't just be based on the instantaneous position, but the retarded position. But hold on, in the static case, the scalar potential is indeed V = q/(4πε₀ r), but when the charge is moving, the expression for V gets a bit more involved because of the time delay.

Wait, but perhaps for potentials, especially when considering radiation and moving charges, the expression might involve the term (d c - d·v), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r, c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity of the charge at tr.

Wait, I remember the scalar potential for a moving charge can be written as V =
