Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is. The question is about a particle moving in two dimensions under a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. And I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, right. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials that depend on r and θ, it's often useful to use polar coordinates because the problem might have some symmetry. The potential here seems to depend on r squared and cos squared θ, which suggests that it might be separable into radial and angular parts.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The potential can be written as V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So, factoring out kr², this becomes V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Alternatively, maybe it's better to expand that. Let's see, 1/2 plus 3/2 cos²θ is the same as (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2. So V(r,θ) = (kr² (1 + 3 cos²θ )) / 2.

Hmm, but how does this help me? Well, in the case of a central potential, like the harmonic oscillator, the potential depends only on r, not on θ. But here, there's an angular dependence as well. So it's not a central potential. So maybe I need to switch to another approach.

Wait, wait a minute. I remember that for central potentials, like the 3D harmonic oscillator, the problem separates into radial and angular parts, and the angular part corresponds to the spherical harmonics. But in 2D, perhaps things are a bit different. Oh, right, in 2D polar coordinates, the Laplacian is still manageable, but the potential complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this potential in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes, working in Cartesian can make things separate. Let me consider that. In 2D Cartesian coordinates, the position is (x, y), and r = sqrt(x² + y²). So cosθ = x/r. So cos²θ is x²/(x² + y²). 

So the potential becomes V(r, θ) =
