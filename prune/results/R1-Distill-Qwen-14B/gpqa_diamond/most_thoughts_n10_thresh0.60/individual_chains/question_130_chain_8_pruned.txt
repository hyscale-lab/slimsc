Okay, so I have this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, let me think about what I know. 

The question mentions that these clouds absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, Lyman alpha emission is a specific spectral line in hydrogen. Right, Lyman alpha is in the ultraviolet range. So, when this line is observed, it's usually part of the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud. But if the cloud is moving away from us, there's a redshift involved, right?

The problem is about finding the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected. So, the idea is that the absorbed light, which is at 1216 Angstroms in their frame, needs to shift into the optical range that ground-based telescopes can observe. Because if the wavelength is too long, it might be in the infrared or even radio, which isn't what optical telescopes are good at.

Wait, correct me if I'm wrong. Optical telescopes can observe from about 380 nm (violet) to around 700 nm (red). So wavelengths longer than that are infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see as effectively because the atmosphere doesn't transmit those wavelengths. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the redshifted wavelength must be less than 700 nm, I think.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second. The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms,
