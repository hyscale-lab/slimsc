Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me take it step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many exhibit optical activity. Optical activity, as I remember, occurs when a compound has chiral centers, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image, thus causing plane-polarized light to rotate. So, each compound needs to be checked for chirality.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   - This is an alkene with substituents on either end. The structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C=C-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me draw this. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one of the H's on the first carbon. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon. Wait, more accurately, the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl=CHCH2CH3? Wait no, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro is on C1, which is part of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? Or wait, maybe it's CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, better to think about the possibility of chirality.

   Wait, the structure is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, because but-
