Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what reagent A and catalyst B were used.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structures to visualize what's happening. 3-Methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl is on the third carbon of the ring. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the cyclohexylidenemethyl group is attached to the first carbon of the pyrrolidine ring.

Cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond connected to a methyl group. Wait, no, the cyclohexylidene is a substituent where the cyclohexane is connected via a double bond, right? So it's like a cyclohexene ring attached via a CH group. So maybe the structure is something like a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group that's part of a double bond.

Wait, no, the term 'cyclohexylidenemethyl' suggests a cyclohexane ring where one of the CH2 groups is replaced with a double bond to the methyl group. Alternatively, it's a cyclohexene substituent attached to a methyl group. So the cyclohexylidene is a substituent that's a cyclohexene (a cyclohexane with a double bond) connected to the pyrrolidine via a methylene group (CH2), but wait, the name is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Hmm, maybe another way. Let me think.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Breaking that down: cyclohexylidene is the substituent where the cyclohexane ring is connected via a double bond, and then a methyl group. Wait, no, more accurately, it's a cyclohexene (with a double bond) connected via a methylene (CH2) group. So, the structure is a cyclohexene ring attached to the pyrrolidine's first carbon via a single bond, but in between, maybe a double bond? Or perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexene group (like a cyclohexene ring with a CH2 group attached to pyrrolidine). 

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexene substituent attached directly via a methylene group. So, like, the pyrrolidine ring has a CH2 group connected to a cyclohexene (so the structure is CH2-Cyclohexene attached to the N).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine,
