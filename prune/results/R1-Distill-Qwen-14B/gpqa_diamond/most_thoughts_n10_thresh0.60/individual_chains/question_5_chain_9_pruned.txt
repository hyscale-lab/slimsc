Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue for this eigenvector is given as +ħ/2. The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to the possible states of the system when measured. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we're looking for a state where measuring the component of P along direction n gives that value.

Wait, but the operator in question is P, but the direction is n. Oh, right, for an angular momentum operator, the expectation value along an arbitrary direction is given by the component of the operator in that direction. So maybe I should first find the operator P along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane.

The direction n can be represented by spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ (phi) would be 0, right? Because the x-z plane corresponds to φ=0, assuming the usual spherical coordinate system where φ is the azimuthal angle. Alternatively, sometimes phi is the polar angle, but I think in this context, since it's in x-z, maybe polar angle theta is measured from the z-axis.

Wait, no. In spherical coordinates, theta is the polar angle from the positive z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or π, but since it's arbitrary, maybe it's 0 for simplicity. But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so perhaps the angle theta is variable, but the direction is along some line in x-z.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the direction of n beyond being in the x-z plane. So perhaps the eigenvector is expressed in terms of theta and phi, but given that it's in the x-z plane, maybe phi is zero? Or perhaps the solution doesn't depend on phi? Hmm, but looking at the options, some of them involve phi, like option B.

Wait, but let me think about how the operator P along direction n is constructed. The general formula for the component of an angular momentum operator along a direction n is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n_x = cos(theta), n_z = sin(theta), because theta here would be the angle from the x-axis, perhaps? Or wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, then n can be represented as (sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)), where theta is the angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle phi would be 0. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). Wait, no, if theta
