Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and honestly, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors of an operator correspond to its eigenstates, and the eigenvalues correspond to the possible measurement outcomes.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So I think that the operator P must be a vector operator, so P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. Or wait, no, the vector operator in the direction n would be P · n, right? Because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the component of the vector operator in that direction.

So the operator we're interested in is P · n, where n is in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or 180, so maybe n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. But the question says it's along an arbitrary direction in x-z, so the direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis, for example.

But wait, the eigenvector is for the operator P along direction n. So the operator in question is P_n = n · P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is in the x-z plane, which would mean n_y = 0. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So P_n would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z, because the y-component of n is zero. But wait, the way the operator is constructed, maybe n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ
