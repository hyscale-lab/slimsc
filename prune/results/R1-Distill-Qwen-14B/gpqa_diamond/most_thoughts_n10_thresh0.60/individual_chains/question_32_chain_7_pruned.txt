Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is lithium with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, lithium usually has 3 protons, so if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

First, I think I need to find the rest mass energy of the lithium nucleus. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the speed v. Since the speed is given as 0.96c, I can calculate gamma for that velocity.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's plug in v = 0.96c. So v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. Subtract that from 1: 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Take the square root of that: sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Oh wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right. So yes, 1/0.28 is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is slightly less, around 939 MeV/c². Wait, but the exact value might be a bit different. Maybe I should look up the precise mass of a Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(proton mass) + 3*(neutron mass). Hmm, but the exact masses might vary.
