Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again and see what it's about.

So, the question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When these spots are not present, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. 

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels depends on the temperature and the Saha equation. Oh wait, right, the Saha equation describes the ionization states of atoms in a stellar atmosphere, but since we're dealing with neutral atoms, maybe it's the Boltzmann equation that's more relevant here. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in different energy levels to the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann factor is something like N_i / N_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights, and E is the energy. So the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels depends exponentially on the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. The photosphere's temperature is lower, which affects the ionization and excitation states of the atoms. 

But wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at one temperature. When 40% is covered by spots, I guess the spots are cooler regions, but the rest of the surface (60% here) is at the higher temperature. But the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. Wait, does that mean that we should model the star's spectrum as a combination of the spotted and unspotted parts, or is the entire photosphere now at 5500 K? Hmm, I think the star's overall
