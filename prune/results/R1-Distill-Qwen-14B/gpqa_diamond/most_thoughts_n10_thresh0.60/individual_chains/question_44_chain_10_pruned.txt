Okay, so I've got this question about a drug's effect on mitochondria and which experiment won't help determine its role. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the drug is supposed to affect mitochondria, and the experiments are testing various aspects. I need to figure out which one doesn't contribute to understanding mitochondrial function or changes caused by the drug.

First, let's understand each option.

Option A: Differential centrifugation extraction of mitochondria and then a glucose uptake assay. Differential centrifugation isolates mitochondria because they're heavy and pellet. Then, the assay measures glucose uptake. Wait, mitochondria aren't the ones taking up glucose; that's the cell's main process, maybe the cell membrane. Glucose is usually taken in by cells via transporters, not the mitochondria. So if the assay is about glucose uptake, maybe it's measuring cellular activity, not mitochondrial. But wait, if the drug affects mitochondrial function, maybe it affects the cell's energy status, which in turn affects glucose uptake. So this could show an indirect effect. But is this specific to mitochondria? Not sure yet.

Option B: Transformation with recombinant luciferase and adding luciferin. I think luciferase is used as a reporter gene. Adding luciferin would make the cells light up. Wait, but if the cells are transformed with luciferase, maybe it's for measuring something like ATP levels. Because luciferase uses ATP to emit light. So if the drug affects ATP production, this assay would show a change. So
