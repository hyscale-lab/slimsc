Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by carefully reading the question.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction reaction. Clemmensen reduction is used to reduce ketones to alkanes. So, that's a key point—Compound X probably has a ketone group because that's what Clemmensen targets.

Looking at the IR data: the peaks are in the regions of 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since we're dealing with a ketone, maybe it's an acidic O-H like in a carboxylic acid? Wait, no, wait. Wait, another thing, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak that usually corresponds to a carbonyl (C=O) group. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So Compound X likely has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, maybe a benzophenone structure or something similar.

The NMR data: Let's parse that. The 1H NMR peaks are as follows:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a carboxylic acid (COOH) would typically show a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, and it's usually a singlet because -OH is exchanging and broad. But wait, in the IR, we saw a strong peak around 1720, which could also be a carboxylic acid (around 1700 cm-1), but wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H peak in IR around 3000-2500. But the IR here shows 3400–2500, which might suggest O-H or N-H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 1720 cm-1
