Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but another possibility is an amine, but I don't see NMR peaks that would suggest that. Then, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl, which could be a carboxylic acid (like around 1700), ester, or maybe ketone. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, maybe a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached.

Now, the 1H NMR. Let's go through the peaks. 10.5 ppm, broad singlet, 1H. That's probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols or amines usually aren't that downfield. So maybe a benzene ring with a COOH group. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H, so probably a para-substituted benzene. So the substituent is at the para position, and since the two doublets are each 2H, it's likely that the substituent is on one carbon and another group on the opposite, but wait, in this case, the substituent is the COOH group. Because the IR has a 1720 cm-1, maybe it's a carbonyl. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. Wait, but 1720 is a bit higher, more like an ester or maybe a ketone. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a benzene ring, which could shift the absorption higher.

Wait, in the NMR, the
