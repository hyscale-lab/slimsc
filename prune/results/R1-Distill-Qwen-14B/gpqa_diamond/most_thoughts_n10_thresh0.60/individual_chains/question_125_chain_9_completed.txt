Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Right, an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator. I remember that in such a system, the potential depends only on the radial distance r, so the problem is symmetric in all directions. That probably means the energy levels are determined by the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, the question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions possible for the same energy eigenvalue. Oh right, the third excited state. I think the ground state is the lowest energy state, so the first excited would be next, then second, and third would be the fourth state overall? Or wait, sometimes people count the ground state as the first state. No, no, the third excited state is the fourth energy level, right? Because ground is zeroth excited, first is first excited, second is second, third is third. Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. Ground state is n=0 (if we're considering the principal quantum number), first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. Hmm, but wait, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), or maybe that's E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction: n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

Wait, no, the energy levels in 3D harmonic oscillator are quantized as E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 ). Oh right, because each direction contributes (n_i + ½) ħω, so adding them gives (n_x +n_y +n_z + 3/2) ħ ω. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So n is the total number of quanta.

So the energy levels depend on the value of n. Each energy level corresponds to a certain number of quanta. So the ground state is n=0, which gives E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be the next level. What's the order of the energy levels?

In 3D, the energy levels can be degenerate. Because different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can give the same n. For example, n=1 can be (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1) → three different states. So the first excited state has E = (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is 3. Then the next is n=2. But wait, when n=2, how many states are there? The possible combinations of (n_x, n_y, n_z) that add up to 2. Let's see:

(2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2) → 3 states.

(1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1) → 3 states.

So total 6 states for n=2. So the energy E for n=2 is (2 + 3/2) ħω = (7/2) ħω. The degeneracy is 6.

Wait, but the third excited state might come after n=3. Let me think about the order of energy levels.

The ground state is n=0: E = 3/2 ħω → degeneracy 1.

n=1: E=5/2 ħω → degeneracy 3.

n=2: E=7/2 ħω → degeneracy 6.

n=3: E=9/2 ħω → degeneracy 10.

Wait, how does that happen? How many states have n=3?

The possible combinations for n_x + n_y + n_z =3. Let me list them:

Each n_i can be 0,1,2,3 as long as their sum is 3.

First, all permutations where one is 3, others 0: (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3) → 3 states.

Then, two 1s and one 1: wait, no, that's three 1s. Wait, no, let's think about the possible partitions.

Another case: two 2s and one -1? No, n_i can't be negative. So another case is two 1s and one 1: that would be (1,1,1) → sum 3. That's 1 unique state, but considering permutations, it's only one state because all are same. So how many arrangements? Only one way.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I'm not listing all possibilities correctly. Let me approach systematically.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x +n_y +n_z =3 is:

Using stars and bars, the number is (3+3-1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. Oh right, so there are 10 states for n=3. So the degeneracy is 10.

So the energy for n=3 is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the energy of the third excited state?

Wait, because the ground state is n=0 (first in energy), then n=1 is the first excited, n=2 the second excited, n=3 the third excited. So the third excited state's energy is (9/2) ħω.

So the energy in the question is (9/2) ħω.

Now, how many eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy? That's the degeneracy, which is 10.

Looking at the options, A is (9/2) ħω, 10. So option A should be the correct answer.

Wait, looking at option A: (9/2) ħω, 10. That matches.

Other options: B has a different energy expression, not involving ω, so probably incorrect. C has 3 as the number, which is n=1's degeneracy. D has a wrong energy expression.

So the answer should be A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are determined by the quantum numbers $n_x, n_y, n_z$ in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively. The total energy is given by:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2}\right),
\]

where $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the total quantum number. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions associated with that energy, which depends on the number of ways to partition $n$ into $n_x, n_y, n_z$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Levels and Degeneracy**:
   - For $n=0$ (ground state): $E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega$, degeneracy $= 1$.
   - For $n=1$ (first excited state): $E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega$, degeneracy $= 3$.
   - For $n=2$ (second excited state): $E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega$, degeneracy $= 6$.
   - For $n=3$ (third excited state): $E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, degeneracy $= 10$.

   The degeneracy for $n=3$ arises from the 10 distinct combinations of $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ that satisfy $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$.

2. **Third Excited State**:
   - The third excited state corresponds to $n=3$, with energy $E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and degeneracy $10$.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 10$ — Correct, matches the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state.
   - **Option B**: $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 10$ — Incorrect, the energy expression is unrelated to the harmonic oscillator.
   - **Option C**: $(9/2) \hbar \omega, 3$ — Incorrect, the degeneracy is $10$, not $3$.
   - **Option D**: $11 \pi^2 \hbar^2 / (2m r^2), 3$ — Incorrect, both the energy and degeneracy are wrong.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **A**, as it provides the correct energy and degeneracy for the third excited state.
