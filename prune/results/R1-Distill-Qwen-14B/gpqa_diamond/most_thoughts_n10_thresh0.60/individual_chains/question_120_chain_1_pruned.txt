Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means they're spread out evenly in all directions without any particular clustering. And the main point is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax itself.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The parallax (plx) is inversely related to the distance to the star. Right, the formula I remember is plx (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance (in parsecs). So if a star is closer, its parallax is higher.

But the question isn't about individual distances; it's about how the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on the parallax value. So, if I consider a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars would fall into that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their distances are uniformly distributed. Wait, no, uniform distribution in 3D space would imply something else. If the number density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars in a volume would depend on the volume. But how does that translate into parallax terms?

Let me think about the volume of space corresponding to a certain parallax range. Parallax is 1/d, so higher parallax means closer stars. So, if I have a parallax range from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance range would be from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). But wait, dplx is a small change, so maybe I can approximate it.

Let me set plx = 1/d. Then a change in plx, dplx, would mean a change in d. Differentiating plx = 1/d, we get dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. So the change in distance, dd, is proportional to d² times the change in parallax, dplx. But since we're considering a small range, we can say that the width in distance (delta d) is approximately d² times delta plx (dplx).

So the volume of space between distance d and d+delta d is a spherical shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr, where r is the radius (distance from us). So in our case, the volume would be 4π (d)^2 (delta d). Plugging in delta d as (d² delta plx), we get 4π d² * (d² delta plx) ) = 4 π d^4 delta plx.

Wait, but d is 1/plx. So substituting d = 1/plx, the volume becomes 4 π (1/plx)^4 delta plx.

Now, if the number density of stars is uniform, say n stars per unit volume, then the number of stars in that volume would be n multiplied by the volume. So N = n * 4 π (1/plx^4) delta plx.

But wait, the question is about the
