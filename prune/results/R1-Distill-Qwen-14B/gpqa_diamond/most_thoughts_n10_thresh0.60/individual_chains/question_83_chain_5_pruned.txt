Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration and pH calculations can get a little tricky. But let's break it down step by step. I'll try to remember what I learned in class.

The question says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

First, I think I need to figure out the initial concentration after dilution. Wait, wait, dilution. Oh right, when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes based on the total volume. So the acetic acid is diluted with water, so the total volume is 20 + 20 = 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) would be the volume times molarity. So 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. Oh wait, wait, no, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, right? So 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 moles. 

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, so 0.04 liters. The new concentration is moles divided by volume. So 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Oh, so the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, when we titrate with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction will be CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid present. Wait, but the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 moles. So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence would be moles /
