Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, plus the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and when you add a strong acid to it, they'll react. The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. Let me write the reaction equation.

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Right, so the acid here is monobasic and strong, like HCl. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+.

First, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. I should calculate the moles.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So for Fe(OH)3, it's 55.85 + (3*(16 +1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me double-check that calculation: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M (molarity), which is 0.1 mol/L. I need to find the volume (V) of this acid that provides 0.002808 moles of H+.

Using the formula M = moles / volume (in liters), so V = moles / M.

So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is pretty close. But wait, maybe I should consider significant figures or rounding. Let's see: 0.002808 is approximately 0.002808, so V=0.02808 L is 28.08 cm³. So the closest option would be option C, which is 28.05. But wait, maybe the exact calculation would differ.

Wait, maybe I should do the calculation more accurately. Let me re-calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Molar mass Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.845, O is 16.00, H is 1.008. So 55.845 + 3*(16.00 + 1.008) = 55.845 + 3*(17.008) = 55.845 + 51.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

Moles Fe(OH)3: 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.1 / 106.869 ≈ 0.0009357 mol.

Moles H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M H+ needed: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³. So option C is 28.05 which is close. But maybe I made a mistake in something else.

Wait, what about the stoichiometry? Oh, right, the reaction is 1:3, so that's correct.

But wait, the problem says "minimum volume". Does that mean I should consider any excess acid? No, because the question asks for the minimum volume needed to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. So all the acid used should just react with Fe(OH)3, no excess. So 28.07 cm³ is the right volume. Looking at the options, option C
