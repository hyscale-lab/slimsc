Alright, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable based on certain criteria. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says that a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, the key here is the S/N ratio. 

I remember that the S/N for a star depends on several factors, mainly the brightness of the star (which is related to its magnitude) and the exposure time. Since all the stars are observed for the same amount of time (1 hour), the main thing I need to compare is their magnitudes and how that translates to S/N.

Wait, but how does the magnitude translate to flux and then to S/N? I think the formula for S/N involves the flux from the star and the background noise. The formula I recall is something like S/N = (flux of star) / (noise per pixel). But I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

I should probably look into how the signal and noise are calculated. Oh wait, the ESPRESSO spectrograph's capabilities are mentioned, so maybe I can find some parameters there. The link provided is about ESPRESSO, but since I can't access it right now, I'll have to rely on what I know.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph on the VLT. I remember it's used for things like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method. It's got a high spectral resolution, but for this question, the key is detecting the star's light with sufficient S/N.

The question gives options a) to f), each with different stars. Let's list them:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star at 10 pc, V=15 mag
d) Star at 200 pc, V=15 mag
e) Star at 5 pc, V=15 mag
f) Star at 50 pc, V=15 mag

Wait, but the absolute magnitude is the same (V=15) for options c, d, e, f. So the only difference for these is the distance. So their apparent magnitudes will vary based on distance. The apparent magnitude is what matters for S/N because that
