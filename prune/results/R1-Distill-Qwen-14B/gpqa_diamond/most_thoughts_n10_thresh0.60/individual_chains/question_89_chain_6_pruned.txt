Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's talking about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure, but I'm not super clear on the exact structure. Anyway, let's break it down step by step.

The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or something. The ¹H NMR spectrum has some specific signals: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). 

Wait, so what reaction conditions are these? KOH and heat usually lead to elimination or substitution. But with a dibromide, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation? Oh wait, but with KOH, maybe it's more of an E2 elimination. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two Br atoms are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, 1,3 would be on opposite ends of the adamantane structure, I think. Let me think about adamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. So, 1,3-dibromo would be on two bridgehead carbons that are not adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, when you heat a dihalide with a strong base like KOH, especially vicinal dihalides, you get elimination reactions. Like, two E2 mechanisms leading to an elimination to form an alkene. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide—vicinal is adjacent. So maybe this is a different reaction. Oh, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but in a different position. Or perhaps it's a double elimination? Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but KOH and heat might not favor substitution as much as elimination for vicinal dihalides.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is around where a carbonyl (like a ketone) would
