Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the reactions are.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+. And the second reaction is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of LDA as the base. I need to find major products A and B and match them with the options.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure must have a five-membered and a three-membered ring? Wait, wait. The spiro notation is spiro[m.n]..., so spiro[3.5]non would mean it's a nine-carbon molecule where two rings, one with 3 carbons and the other with 5, are connected at a single carbon.

Wait, the formula is spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the main chain is nine carbons, but arranged in two rings. Let me try to visualize it. Oh, I think the main chain is nonane, but in a spiro arrangement with a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro carbon. So the structure probably has a double bond somewhere else, as it's a non-5-en-1-ol.

The reaction conditions are THF, KH, and H+. THF is a solvent, so that's just the medium. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. I remember that when alcohols react with strong bases like KH, they can undergo elimination reactions, forming alkenes. Alternatively, if the alcohol is in a position that allows for cyclization, maybe some kind of annulation.

Wait, in the presence of a strong base like KH, the alcohol (which is an -OH group) would deprotonate. But wait, 1-vinylspiro... the OH is on the spiro carbon, which is also attached to a vinyl group. So when the base deprotonates the OH, it becomes an alkoxide. But where else can a proton be abstracted for elimination? Alternatively, maybe the base induces an elimination, forming a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the base could cause a ring-opening or a rearrangement, especially since the starting material is a spiro compound. Alternatively, perhaps this is a pinacol-like rearrangement or some kind of enol ether formation.

Wait, another thought: when an alcohol is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can undergo elimination to form an alkene. But in this case, the starting material already has a vinyl group, a double bond. So maybe the base is abstracting a proton adjacent to the OH, leading to elimination and ring formation. Wait, the spiro structure has two rings connected at one carbon. If the base abstracts a proton from one of the rings, perhaps leading to the formation of a larger ring.

Let me think about the structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-
