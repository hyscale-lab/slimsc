Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture X decolorizes bromine water, which I remember means it has unsaturated bonds—like double bonds or triple bonds—because bromine water is decolorized by such compounds. So the two liquids in X must have unsaturated structures.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which is also an equimolar mixture of two other liquids. Importantly, Y does not decolorize bromine water. So whatever happened in this reaction must have removed the ability of Y to decolorize bromine. That suggests that the unsaturated bonds in X were hydrogenated to a point where they can't react with bromine anymore. But wait, wait—disproportionation is when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one of the components in X is getting hydrogenated in a way that breaks some bonds but doesn't just add hydrogen across a double bond.

Next, it says hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen of about 14.28%, and it's a constituent of Y. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's fully saturated—maybe an alkane. Additionally, Z is widely used as a solvent, which makes me think of something like hexane or pentane. Wait, but the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%—let me calculate.

The mass of hydrogen in Z is 14.28% of its molar mass. Let's think about possible alkanes. The formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. The percentage of hydrogen would be (2n+2) / (12n + 2) * 100. Let's set that equal to 14.28 and see what n would be.

14.28% is approximately 1/7, so:

(2n+2)/(12n +2) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by (12n +2)*7:

7(2n + 2) = 12n + 2.

14n +14 =12n +2.

Subtract 12n: 2n +14 =2.

2n = -12. That can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let's set up the equation again.

Hydrogen mass fraction: (2n+2) / (12n + 2 + 2*1) = 14.28%? Wait, no. The formula is correct as (2n +2)/(12n + 2) *100 =14.28.

Let me rearrange:

(2n + 2) = 0.1428 * (12n +2)

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals:
