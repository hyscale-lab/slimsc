Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and its energy states. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule composed of atoms X and Y. They've given me the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

Wait, I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions involve changes in both rotational and vibrational energy. The quantum rotation-vibration model, right. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to a higher energy state, which could involve a change in both rotation and vibration.

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational state or a change in rotation. Oh wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the lowest possible higher energy state would be the first excited state, which is likely the first vibrational state, because rotational transitions are usually in the microwave and vibrational in infrared.

But wait, sometimes the rigid rotor model is considered, but this is the non-rigid rotor model. Oh but the main point here is that the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational energy. So the next state could be a combination of higher rotational and
