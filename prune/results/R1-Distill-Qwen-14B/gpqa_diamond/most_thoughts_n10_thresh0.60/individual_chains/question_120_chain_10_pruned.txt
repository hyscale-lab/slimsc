Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume that stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in the sky—does that mean their spatial density is the same everywhere? I think so. So, the number density of stars doesn't depend on where you are in the sky, but maybe it depends on the distance from us.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Parallax, plx, is a measure of distance. I remember that parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So, higher parallax means closer stars.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, how does N (number of stars) depend on plx?

I think I should model this using some geometry. Let's imagine looking at a spherical shell (a thin layer) at a certain distance d. The thickness of the shell would be a small change in d, say delta d. The volume of this shell would be 4πd² delta d. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be proportional to the volume. So, N = n * volume, where n is the number density of stars.

But wait, the question is about per unit range of plx, not per unit distance. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me think about how the volume relates to plx.

So, the volume element for a spherical shell
