Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax (p) is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance (d) in parsecs is d = 1/p, where p is in arcseconds. So a larger parallax means a closer star, and a smaller parallax means a more distant one.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean uniformly in space, or uniformly in some other sense? Oh, I think uniform distribution here probably refers to them being spread out evenly in space, not clustered. So their density is the same throughout the space they occupy.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if I consider a small range of parallax, say from p to p+dp, how many stars would I expect in that range per unit volume, I guess.

Let me think about the volume. The parallax p is inversely related to distance. So, for a star at distance d, p = 1/d. Wait, no, p is in arcseconds, and d in parsecs, so p = 1/d in parsecs. So, as d increases, p decreases.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say n is the number density. Then, the number of stars in a certain volume would be n multiplied by that volume.

But the problem is about how the number of stars per unit parallax range (dp) depends on p. So perhaps I should express the volume in terms of parallax.

Wait, volume in three dimensions is a function of distance. So, for a given distance d, the volume element around that distance would be a sphere of radius d, I think. Or maybe a shell between d and d+dd.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dd would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the thickness and the number density. Let's see. The surface area of a sphere is 4πd². The volume of the shell would be 4πd² * dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But the parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So, let's substitute d in terms of p. So, d = 1/p → dd = -1/p² dp (since d is decreasing as p increases, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, d decreases, but the magnitude is what matters for the volume element).

Substituting d =1/p into the number of stars: n * 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p² dp) → but I'm looking for the number per unit parallax, so the negative just indicates the direction, but we'll take absolute values.

Wait, perhaps I should express the number of stars in a small range of parallax. Let's say we have a parallax range from p to p+dp. The corresponding distances are d =1/p and d+dd =1/(p+dp).
