Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission or absorption line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Oh wait, right, neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs at around 1216 Angstroms, which is the Lyman alpha line. But that's in the rest frame of the hydrogen cloud, I suppose.

Now, the quasar's light is being absorbed by this hydrogen. So the hydrogen is between us and the quasar, right? So the quasar is at a higher redshift than the hydrogen cloud. Oh wait, no, I think I have that backwards. Wait, the quasar is the background object, so the hydrogen cloud is in front of it. So the hydrogen's redshift would be lower than the quasar's. But I'm not sure if that matters for this question.

But the main point is about detecting the absorption line with optical telescopes. So optical wavelengths are longer than UV. So when the light from the quasar passes through the hydrogen cloud, the Lyman alpha absorption (which is originally 1216 Angstroms, which is about 0.1216 micrometers, or 12.16 nm) gets redshifted.

Wait, because if the cloud is moving away from us, its emission or absorption lines would be at a longer wavelength. So the observed wavelength λ_obs is equal to λ_rest * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

But optical telescopes can't observe wavelengths beyond a certain point. Wait, what's the cutoff for optical? I think that optical typically goes up to about 1 micrometer or so, maybe a bit more, but for ground-based telescopes, the atmosphere is opaque to certain infrared wavelengths. So the maximum wavelength observable by ground-based optical telescopes is in the near-infrared, but not too far. Let me think: maybe the cutoff is around 1 micrometer (1000 nm) or 10000 Angstroms? Because beyond that is infrared, which is absorbed by the atmosphere and thus not observable from the ground except at certain windows.

But wait, some optical telescopes can go into the near-infrared. The visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm, but optical often extends a bit beyond. So perhaps up to about 1000 nm (1 micrometer) or 10,000 Angstroms. Hmm.

Wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the hydrogen's Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. The observed wavelength λ_obs is 1216*(1+z). For us to see this absorption line in the optical, λ_obs must be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe.

Wait, no, because if the observed wavelength is too long (i.e., redshifted too much), it would be in the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So the maximum redshift we can observe the Lyman alpha line in the optical is when λ_obs is at the cutoff.

So the lower limit on the redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just within the optical range. So if the maximum λ_obs is, say, around 1000 nm (10,000 Angstroms), then:

1216 * (1 + z) ≤ 10,000 Angstroms.

Wait wait, no, because 1000 nm is 10,000 Angstroms. 1216 Angstroms is 0.1216 micrometers, which is 121.6 nm. So let me calculate:

(1 + z) =
