Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of product 3. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanisms, but I'll try to recall.

The first step is treating toluene with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration reactions typically occur under such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, so when it undergoes nitration, the nitro group will add in a specific position. Since methyl is an activating group, the nitration should happen at the para position, right? So product 1 would be para-nitro toluene. Wait, no, wait. Toluene is methylbenzene. When nitrated, the nitro group is usually para or ortho to the methyl. But since the methyl is an activating group, the nitration occurs where? Oh wait, nitration is a meta-directing group when it's a nitro group, but wait, no, the incoming nitro group is a meta director for the next substitution. But in this case, the methyl is ortho/para directing. So the nitration of toluene with nitric and sulfuric acid would give a nitro group para to the methyl, making para-methyl nitrobenzene? Or is it para-nitro toluene? Actually, it's para-methyl nitrobenzene. So product 1 is p-nitro toluene.

Then product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. I think in acidic conditions, especially with H2SO4, MnO2 oxidizes methyl groups attached to benzene rings. Wait, toluene derivatives: when you have a methyl group attached to benzene and it's oxidized, the methyl (CH3) becomes a COOH group. So, oxidation of toluene derivative gives benzoic acid. But wait, in this case, product 1 is para-nitro toluene. So when oxidized, the methyl becomes a COOH group. So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. Wait, no, the nitro group is on the benzene ring, and the methyl is converted to COOH. So the structure would be nitro in the para position relative to the COOH group. So the molecule is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

Now, product
