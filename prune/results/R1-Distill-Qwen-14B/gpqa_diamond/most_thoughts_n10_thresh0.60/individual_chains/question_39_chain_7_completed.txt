Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to quantum mechanics, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem says that we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (the x-axis). The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When measuring the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So, the question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. One of the key things is that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. That is, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must be 1. Also, since the problem states that no particles were found outside x=1 and x=3, that suggests that the probability of finding the particle in x < 1 or x > 3 is zero. Therefore, the wave function must be zero outside this region.

Wait, but looking at the given wave function, it's (a/sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, but if the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3, that would mean the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3. But the given function isn't zero in that case. Unless perhaps the wave function is zero outside that region, and the given expression is for a part where it's non-zero.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, but perhaps this is valid only within the region where x is between 1 and 3. So, outside of that, the wave function is zero. Therefore, when we calculate the normalization condition, we must integrate the square of the absolute value of the wave function from x=1 to x=3, because elsewhere it's zero.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me compute |ψ(x)|². The wave function is ψ = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. So the absolute square would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, since the imaginary part is 0.5i. Because when you take the absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib, it's a² + b².

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) is a function of x, with real part a/(sqrt(1+x)) and imaginary part -0.5. So |ψ(x)|² is [Re(ψ)]² + [Im(ψ)]².

So that would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

The integral of this from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1.

So:

∫₁³ [ (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2 ] dx = 1.

I can split this into two integrals:

a² ∫₁³ [1/(1+x)] dx + ∫₁³ (0.5)^2 dx = 1.

Let me compute each part.

First, compute the integral of 1/(1+x) dx. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C. So evaluating from 1 to 3:

ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first term is a² * ln(2).

The second integral is (0.5)^2 * (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

Putting it all together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²:

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Now, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root to find a:

a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.1

B) 0.85

C) 0.35

D) 0.6

So 0.85 is option B. But wait, let me check my calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the absolute square is [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Right. The integral from 1 to 3 of [a^2/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Breaking into two integrals:

a² ∫₁³ 1/(1+x) dx = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

And ∫₁³ 0.25 dx = 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So total equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / (ln 2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2): ln(2)≈0.6931, so 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7212.

a = sqrt(0.7212) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. So option B is correct.

But wait, let me think again. Because the wave function is presented as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. So it's a complex wave function. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function's absolute square gives the probability density. However, for the wave function to be a valid solution, the integral of the probability density must be 1.

But I'm a bit concerned about whether the imaginary part is a constant. That's an unusual form. Typically, the wave functions have x-dependent real and imaginary parts. But in this case, the imaginary part is just a constant (-0.5i).

But regardless, the approach of integrating the absolute square is correct, because the wave function is given and we apply the normalization condition.

So I think my calculations are correct. The value of 'a' should be approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function, which states that the total probability of finding the particle in all space must equal 1. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the normalization condition is:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1
\]

Substituting \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), we have:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx + \int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 1
\]

1. **First term**: The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
\]

Thus, the first term becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. **Second term**: The integral of \( 0.25 \) over \( x \) from 1 to 3 is:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5
\]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
