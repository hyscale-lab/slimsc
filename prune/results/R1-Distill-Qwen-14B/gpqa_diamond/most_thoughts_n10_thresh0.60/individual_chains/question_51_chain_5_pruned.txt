Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. Hmm, I remember that potential energy in such systems often involves considering the work done to bring charges together, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here.

Wait, the sphere is conducting and grounded. Oh right, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, so any excess charge will go into the ground. But wait, in this case, the charge q is outside the sphere. So how does that affect the sphere's charge?

I think when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, charges are induced on the sphere. But since it's grounded, the induced charges can leave, right? Wait, no, wait. Actually, wait: a conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium will have charges induced on its surface. If it's grounded, any induced charge can flow into the ground, keeping the sphere's net charge zero. But wait, no, wait again. If the sphere is initially neutral and then a charge is placed near it, the induced charges would cause the sphere to have a net charge. But because it's grounded, the induced charges can leave, so the sphere's net charge remains zero. Or does it?

Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again. A conducting sphere allows charges to move freely. So when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's charges rearrange. But because the sphere is
