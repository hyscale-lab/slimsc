Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it logically.

So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending up with a final product. There are five steps, each with specific reagents, and we need to track the changes at each step to determine the final structure.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction step by step.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1.

Hmm, I remember that when benzene reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) in the presence of sulfuric acid (H2SO4), it undergoes nitration. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution reaction where a nitro group (-NO2) is added to the benzene ring. The nitronium ion (NO2+) is the electrophile here. Benzene tends to undergo nitration at the meta position when nitrated once, but waitâ€”no, actually, no. Wait, nitration typically occurs at the meta position when there are already substituents, but in the case of benzene itself, since it's just benzene, the nitration will occur in a specific position based on directing groups. Wait, no, benzene is symmetric. So the nitration of benzene will produce nitrobenzene as a single product because all positions are equivalent. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, which is a benzene ring with a nitro group attached.

Wait, but wait a second. Nit
