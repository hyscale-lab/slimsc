Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels.

Hmm, let me read the problem again. So, the star has a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the star's surface is cooler when spots are present.

Wait, but wait. How does having spots lower the overall effective temperature? Oh right, because spots are cooler regions. So when 40% is covered, the total emitted flux decreases, hence the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower. But how does this affect the ionization and excitation of atoms like Ti in the photosphere?

The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Oh, so the ratio N1/N2 decreases when spots are present. So when spots are present, N1/N2 is lower. So the factor is N1/N2 (no spots) divided by N1/N2 (with spots) = (N1_no/N2_no) / (N1_yes/N2_yes) = (N1_no/N1_yes) * (N2_yes/N2_no) ) 

Wait, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the ratios. Let me think.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, wait more accurately, the ratio N_i/N_j is (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Wait, let
