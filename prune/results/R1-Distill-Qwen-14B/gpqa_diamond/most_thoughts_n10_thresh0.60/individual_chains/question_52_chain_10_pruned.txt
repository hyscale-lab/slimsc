Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots on its surface, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the problem talks about the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ångströms. We're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. 

Hmm, right. So, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (n1/n2) is equal to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

When the star doesn't have spots, the effective temperature is 6000 K. When it has 40% spots, the overall T drops to 5500 K. But wait, does the spot coverage affect the temperature uniformly? Or is the spot a cooler region? Oh, right, spots are cooler, so when part of the surface is covered by spots, the observed effective temperature of the entire photosphere decreases. So the effective temperature across the entire photosphere goes down to 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star's surface isn't covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature of the unspotted areas must be higher than 6000 K, but wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the star's overall Teff when 40% is covered is 5500 K. So the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K then. But when there are no spots, the Teff is 6000 K. So the star's overall Teff changes. But the spots are cooler regions on the surface, so when they're present, the average Teff is lower. So the unspotted regions are hotter than 6000 K? Because the overall Teff is lower, so the unspotted parts must be hotter to balance.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about effective temperature. The effective temperature is calculated based on the total luminosity. The star emits less when spots cover part of its surface. So the effective temperature depends on the area of the star emitting at a certain temperature. Let me model this.

The star's surface area when not spotted is 4π
