Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's an important starting point. The molecular formula tells me the number of each type of atom in the molecule. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. 

Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in the numbers: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 + 2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5? Wait, no, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be whole numbers. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. Oh wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, X=0 (no halogens), N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. Each degree could be a ring or a double bond. So 5 could be, like, one ring and four double bonds? Or perhaps several rings and double bonds. But more likely, maybe a combination.

Now, looking at the NMR data. Let's list out the peaks. The 1H-NMR is given as: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). 

The first peak is at 9.72. That's a triplet (t), integrating to 1H. The triplet suggests it's next to two neighboring protons. What could that be? Maybe an aldehyde proton? Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait
