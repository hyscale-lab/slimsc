Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and then the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to find out the final product from the options given.

First, let me break down the NMR data. The 1H NMR peaks are at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm, okay.

Let me think about each peak. 9.72 ppm with a triplet is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, so that makes sense. So the compound has an aldehyde group.

Next, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets. Each with 2H. Those are probably aromatic protons. So maybe there are two phenyl rings attached. Let me think about how that would fit.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet could be an -OH group, but wait, hydroxyls are usually broader, but sometimes exchange with D2O can make them disappear. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enol form or something else. Wait, but another possibility is that it's a double bond, maybe as part of a diene or an allylic system. But I'm not sure yet.

The 3.66 ppm doublet with 2H. A doublet usually indicates coupling with one neighboring set of protons. 3.6 ppm is a bit upfield. Maybe this is a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen, or maybe it's part of an ether or ester. Alternatively, it could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2.

Now, considering the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be from a ring and double bonds. For example, a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) plus a double bond and another ring, or perhaps a benzene and a double bond and a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe a benzene ring (3), an aldehyde (1), and a double bond (1), and maybe another ring? Or maybe a benzene, a carbonyl, and a double bond. Let me think.

Looking at the NMR again. The aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm. So maybe the structure is a substituted benzaldehyde. But wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So if it's a benzaldehyde derivative, the substituents would include a phenyl group and maybe another group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me consider the structure. Maybe it's a benzaldehyde with a substituent on the benzene ring. But another possibility is that it's a di-substituted benzene, perhaps with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diphenyl compound. Wait, C8H9NO. If it's two phenyl groups (each is C6H5), but then that's C12, which is too much. So perhaps not. Wait, maybe one phenyl group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a phenyl group attached to a side chain that includes the aldehyde and some other groups. Let's think: the aldehyde is at one end, and the other end is a phenyl group. So maybe something like benzaldehyde with some substituents on the benzene ring and another group attached.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows peaks that suggest substitution on a benzene ring. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets could be two sets of aromatic protons. For example, perhaps para-substituted benzene rings.

Wait, but each is a doublet. So for a para-substituted benzene, you'd have two doublets because of the coupling between the two sets of equivalent protons. So that makes sense. So perhaps two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet, indicating coupling between each other. So maybe each set is two equivalent protons, and they're adjacent to substituents.

Wait, but two doublets each integrating to 2H. Maybe it's a para-disubstituted benzene. Or perhaps two separate benzene rings. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but there's also a peak at 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, 2H. Could that be an enol proton? Or maybe it's a di-substituted double bond, like a conjugated diene? Or maybe a vinyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom.

Wait, let's think about the reactions. The compound is treated with NaNO2 and HCl. Then H2O, then aqueous KOH with heat.

NaNO2 and HCl usually are used for diazotization. Diazonium salt formation, typically with aromatic amines
