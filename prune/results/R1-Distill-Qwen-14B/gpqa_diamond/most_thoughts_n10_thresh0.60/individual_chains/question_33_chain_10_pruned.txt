Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction between 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione under heat. We need to find the exo product from the given options.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are Diels-Alder reactions. Wait, but wait, Diels-Alder is a [4π + 2π] process, right? So the diene (conjugated double bonds) and a dienophile (a molecule with a double bond that can act as a electrophilic component) reacting to form a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds.

But wait, in this case, the reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione. Hmm. Let me think about their structures. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. 2,5-dimethylthiophene would have methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Furan-2,5-dione is another five-membered ring, but with two ketone groups at positions 2 and 5. So it's like a furan with O=C-O groups at those positions?

Wait, no. Furan is O=C-O, so furan-2,5-dione would have two keto groups. So the structure
