Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Hmm.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about identifying which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound exhibits optical isomerism. The options are given, and we have to choose between four possibilities.

First, let me understand the terms. Isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. There are constitutional isomers, which have different connectivity, and stereoisomers, which have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements. Stereoisomers can be either geometric (cis-trans) or optical (enantiomers).

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different structures (tautomer pairs) via the movement of a hydrogen atom and the reorganization of double bonds. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a carbonyl group can tautomerize into an enol form. But for this to happen, the molecule must have adjacent carbonyl groups or specific structures that allow this shift.

Optical isomerism, also known as chirality, occurs when a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. If a molecule has such a center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity. Alternatively, other forms of chirality can exist without a chiral center, like in allenes or compounds with helical structures, but the most common is the chiral center.

Now, looking at the compounds provided:

For part A, the options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a quinone, which typically has two ketone groups. Benzoquinone can be 1,2 (ortho), 1,3 (meta), or 1,4 (para) isomers. But wait, the specific one here is benzoquinone. Quinones generally have conjugated carbonyl groups. Do they exhibit tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires a structure where a hydrogen can move with a shift in double bonds. Quinones have two ketone groups adjacent to each other in a conjugated system. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O, but wait, that's actually two carbonyls in a ring. Wait, no, 1,4-benzoquinone is O=C-C6H4-C=O, but the ring actually has conjugated double bonds. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, quinones can have enol tautomer forms. Let me think. Another thought: quinones can act as dienophiles in Diels-Alder reactions, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, maybe benzoquinone has a structure that allows for tautomerism. For example, if there's a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group, like in a situation where a keto-enol tautomer
