Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, a particle in two dimensions with a certain potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Wait, I remember that in two-dimensional quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, it's helpful to separate the potential into radial and angular parts. So the potential here has two terms: one that's purely radial, (1/2)k r², and another that depends on both r and θ, (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite the potential in a way that separates the r and θ dependence. Let me think. Oh, right, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is equal to (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2.

Let me compute that. (3/2) times (1/2) is 3/4. So,

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) is 5/4. So,

V(r, θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps that's not the most useful way. Alternatively, maybe I can group the terms differently. Let's see: the potential is (1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ ) k r². So, V(r, θ) = k r² [ (1/2) + (3/2 cos²θ) ].

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the potential in terms of angular momentum or other quantum numbers. But I'm a bit rusty on this.

Wait, another approach: the Hamiltonian in polar coordinates for a two-dimensional particle. The Hamiltonian is H = (p_r²)/(2m) + (p_θ²)/(2m r²) + V(r,θ).

So, in our case, the potential V(r,θ) is [1/2 k r² + 3/2 k r² cos²θ]. Let me factor out the k r²: V = k r² [ 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Hmm, that [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ] can be rewritten. Let me see: 1/2 is (1/2)(1), so 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2.

So, V(r,θ) = [ (1 + 3 cos²θ) / 2 ] * k r².

Wait, maybe I can find if this potential can be expressed in terms that separate into radial and angular parts. Because if the potential is separable, then the energy eigenstates can be written as products of radial and angular functions.

Wait, the potential is V(r) * [something]. Let me think. Wait,
