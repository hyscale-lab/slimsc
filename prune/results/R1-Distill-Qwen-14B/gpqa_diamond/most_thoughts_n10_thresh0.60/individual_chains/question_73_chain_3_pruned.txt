Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

The problem states that the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in special relativity, we can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Instead, we have to use the velocity addition formula. Oh wait, right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, wait. Let me think. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative velocity would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula for the relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the first object from the perspective of the second, or something like that. Alternatively, I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Let me get this right. Oh right, because if you have two velocities u and v in the same direction, the relative velocity is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's B's speed? Or maybe from B's perspective, A's speed? Wait, I think the question is asking for the relative speed, which direction? Oh wait, the problem says "relative speed"—so it's the speed of one as seen from the other, but which way? Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, A is moving faster than B. So from A's frame, B is moving backward, right? Or wait, in the same direction? Hmm, maybe I should compute it correctly.

Wait, the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction. Let
