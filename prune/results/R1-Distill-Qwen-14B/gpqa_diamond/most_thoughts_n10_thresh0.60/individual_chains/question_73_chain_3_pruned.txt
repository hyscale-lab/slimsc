Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's see.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I think I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical addition because of relativistic effects. So the relative speed isn't as simple as subtracting their velocities.

Wait, right, the formula for adding velocities in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative velocity would be (0.6c - 0.5c) divided by (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (u' - v) / (1 - (u'v)/c²), where u' is the velocity of the object relative to the first frame, and v is the velocity of the moving frame. Wait, actually, perhaps I should think of it as the relative speed between them.

Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed? Or from B's perspective, what is A's speed? Because in relativity,
