Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). An observable P is a matrix with specific elements. I need to find the probability that measuring P will give 0.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors of the operator. But wait, the problem just gives me the matrix P. I think I should first see if 0 is an eigenvalue of P. Because the probability of measuring 0 would be zero if 0 isn't an eigenvalue.

So step one: find the eigenvalues of P. But wait, maybe I don't need to find all of them. Alternatively, perhaps the operator P is a projection operator. Let me look at the matrix P again.

P is a 3x3 matrix. First row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]. Third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0].

Wait a second, that looks familiar. Let me write P out:

Row 1: 0   1/√2   0
Row 2: 1/√2 0   1/√2
Row 3: 0   1/√2   0

Hmm. Let me calculate the trace, which is the sum of the diagonal elements. 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So trace is zero. But wait, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues. So if 0 is an eigenvalue, the others have to add up to zero. But I'm not sure if that's helpful right now.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. But that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if the matrix is idempotent (P^2 = P), which would make it a projection matrix. If P is a projection matrix, then its eigenvalues are 0 and 1. But wait, let me check.

Let me compute P squared. Let's see what the (1,1) element is. First row of P squared is first row of P multiplied by each column.

Wait,
