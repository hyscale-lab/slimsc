Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, particles colliding, detectors... Lorentz factors. Oh right, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time, length, and other things dilate at high velocities. 

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying, moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of them reach the inner walls.

Wait, so initially, with gamma=20, only one third make it. We need to find the gamma where two-thirds make it. So, I think this has to do with the particles' lifetime and how much they can travel before decaying. 

I remember that in relativity, the lifetime of a particle as measured in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame). So the particles' lifetime is extended in the lab frame because of time dilation. 

The distance the particle travels before decaying would be its velocity multiplied by the lifetime. Since they're ultra-relativistic, their velocity is approximately the speed of light, so distance is roughly c multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma * tau (where tau is proper lifetime).

Wait, the average distance a particle travels before decaying is d = gamma * c * tau. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so they go further.

But since all particles are produced at the center, the maximum distance they can travel before hitting the detector walls is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. So particles that decay within the detector radius will reach the walls, and those that decay beyond that won't.

Wait, no, the detector is a sphere with radius 30m. So the particles start at the center. So the maximum distance they can travel is 30 meters before they hit the wall. So their lifetime must allow them to reach that distance.

So the particles will reach the wall if their lifetime is such that gamma * tau * c >= 30 meters. Because if they live long enough to reach 30 meters, they'll hit the wall.

But wait, actually, the average is given. So when gamma is 20, only one third reach the wall. So that implies that the average distance they travel is 30 meters. Wait, no, because if they're produced in the center, and the detector walls are at 30m, the average distance they travel is the average of what they can go. 

Wait, perhaps I should model it as the decay length. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. That depends on gamma and the proper lifetime. The decay length L is gamma * c * tau * beta, but since they are ultra-relativistic, beta is approximately 1. So L â‰ˆ gamma * c * tau.

But wait, if the average decay length is 30 meters, then for gamma=20, only one third reach the wall, which is 30m
