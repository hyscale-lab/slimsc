Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is close to room temperature, maybe a bit lower. Then there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is a reagent in organic chemistry and has a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, I need to break this down. Let's start with the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let me think about common gases. Maybe H2O? No, wait, H2O has H and O. Let me calculate:

Hydrogen has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Oxygen typically has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So H2O's molecule would have (2 H: 2*(1p,0n)) and 1 O: 8p,8n. So total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 0+8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

What about CO2? Carbon has 6p,6n usually. Oxygen 8p,8n. CO2: 1 C (6p,6n), 2 O (each 8p,8n). Total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the molecule. So each molecule has same number of p and n. That fits W.

Wait, but is CO2 a gas that's released when a reaction happens? Like maybe a carbonate reacting with acid? Because CO2 is a common gas in such reactions. So maybe Y is an acid? Like HCl or H2SO4? Or maybe Y is water? Hmm.

But let's think about the reaction. X reacts violently with Y, which is a liquid. What liquids react violently with something? Maybe something like sodium reacting with water. Oh wait, sodium is a metal that reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas. But wait, in that case, the gas W would be H2. Let me check H2. Each molecule has two H atoms, each with 1p and 0n. So protons are 2, neutrons 0. Not equal. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, if Y is a liquid like liquid nitrogen or something else, but that's less likely. Let me think again about the gas. Alternatively, maybe CH4? No, because that's not a common product of such reactions. Or maybe O2? No, O2 has 16p and 16n per molecule. Wait, O2 is O2, so each O has 8p, 8n. So O2 has 16p, 16n. So same. So O2 is a possible W. But when would O2 be released? Maybe in a decomposition reaction, like if B is something that decomposes to O2 when heated. But let's think more.

Wait, the precipitate G when heated releases B, whose melting point is about 277 K. 277 K is roughly 4°C. So B is probably a solid that's solid just above 0°C. What could that be? Maybe something like water ice? Because water freezes at 273 K (0°C). So 277 is a bit higher, but close. Alternatively, maybe something else. Or perhaps B is a different substance, but let's think about it.

Also, the product of a keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. Keto acid, like maybe something that adds an oxygen. Wait, maybe X is a base, like NaOH. Because if you have a keto acid (
