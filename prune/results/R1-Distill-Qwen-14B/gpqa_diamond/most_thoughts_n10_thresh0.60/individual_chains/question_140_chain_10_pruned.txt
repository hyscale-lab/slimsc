Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's take it step by step. The problem is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. Also, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, so let's start by figuring out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Let's go through each part.

First, the reaction: X reacts with liquid Y to release gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons—so the molecule must be something like H2O? No, because H2O has 8 protons (O) and 1 each for H. Wait, no. Wait, each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, maybe it's CO or something else. Alternatively, perhaps W is a molecule where each atom has equal neutrons and protons. For example, maybe W is H2 (but no, because H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in most cases). Or perhaps W is something like O2 or N2. Wait, but O2 would have 8 protons each, but 8 neutrons each would make the isotope O-16. Oh wait, but the molecule as a whole—wait, the problem says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. So for example, if it's H2O, the total would be 2 H (each with 1p and 0n) and 1 O (8p and 8n). So total p: 2 +8 =10, n: 0 +8=8. Not same. So that wouldn't work.

Wait, maybe W is CO. Let's see—C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (isotope C-12), O has 8 protons
