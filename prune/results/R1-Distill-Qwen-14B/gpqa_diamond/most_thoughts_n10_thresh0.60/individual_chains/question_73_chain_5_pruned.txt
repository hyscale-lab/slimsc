Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two astronauts traveling at relativistic speeds. Their masses are given as 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm supposed to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a possible relative speed and energy.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. So, for the relative speed, I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but wait, which direction are they moving? Oh, they're both moving in the positive x-direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So relative motion would be from 1's perspective, seeing 2 moving at v_rel. Or is it the other way around? I think it doesn't matter because the formula accounts for direction. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction. So, astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c with respect to the lab frame, astronaut 2 at v = 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's perspective, what is the speed of astronaut 2? So using the formula, the relative speed u' would be (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/(c²)).

Wait, wait a second, no. Wait, I think I might have the formula wrong. Let me think: if frame S sees object A moving at u, and object B moving at v, then the speed of B as seen from A is (v - u)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). Because A's frame is moving at u relative to S, so when you do velocity addition, the formula is (v + u')/(1 + (u' v')/(c²)) or something like that. Maybe I should get the correct formula straight.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the correct formula for relative velocity in special relativity. Oh right, the formula for the relative velocity
