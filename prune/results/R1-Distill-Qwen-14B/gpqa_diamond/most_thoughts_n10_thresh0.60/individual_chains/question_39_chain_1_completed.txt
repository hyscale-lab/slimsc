Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle that's moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measure the position of the particles, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3, so all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' from the given options.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding the particle at a certain position. The total probability over all space should be 1, meaning the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from -infinity to infinity is 1. But in this case, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, so the wave function must be zero outside this region. Wait, no, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when you square this, the imaginary part would come in, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. The wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave functions are generally complex, so ψ(x) can have a real part and an imaginary part. However, the probability density is calculated as |ψ(x)|² = ψ*(x) ψ(x), which is the product of the complex conjugate and the wave function itself.

So let's compute |ψ(x)|². ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate ψ*(x) would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So multiplying them:

ψ*(x)ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i] * [a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i]

This looks like (A + B)(A - B) = A² - B², where A is (a/sqrt(1+x)) and B is 0.5i. So,

= (a/sqrt(1+x))² - (0.5i)^2
= a²/(1 + x) - (0.25 i²)
But i² is -1, so this becomes a²/(1 + x) - (0.25*(-1))
= a²/(1 + x) + 0.25

So the probability density is a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but wait. That's the probability density function. But we have to normalize this such that the integral from x=1 to x=3 equals 1 because the particles are only found between 1 and 3. Or wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, but when you calculate the integral of |ψ(x)|² over all space, it must be 1. But in this problem, the measurements show that all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3, implying that the wave function is zero outside this region. Wait, but the given ψ(x) is non-zero outside x=1 to x=3? Or is it that the wave function is zero outside? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says that when measuring, none were found at x <1 or x>3, which implies that the probability density is zero outside that interval. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the given wave function is only valid in that region, and zero elsewhere. But the given ψ is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, which would have non-zero values outside x=1 to x=3. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and is zero elsewhere. But the problem states that the wave function in a part of space where the particle can exist is as given. So perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. In that case, the wave function is ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for 1 <= x <=3, and zero otherwise. So when integrating for normalization, we only integrate from x=1 to x=3.

Wait, but the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Does that apply only where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3? Or is it the case that the wave function is given as that expression in the region where the particle exists, and zero elsewhere?

I think the way to approach this is to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3, and set it equal to 1, then solve for 'a'.

So, |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25, as I calculated earlier. So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx must equal 1.

Let's compute this integral:

Integral from 1 to3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = a² * Integral [1/(1+x)] dx + Integral 0.25 dx.

Compute each part:

Integral [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3 is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So the total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the wave function. If the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i, then when you take its modulus squared, you get [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25. But this is a real function, right? Because the imaginary parts cancel out as I computed earlier.

But wait, the wave function in quantum mechanics must satisfy certain conditions, like being square-integrable, and the probability density must be real and non-negative. So in this case, [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25 must be positive for all x in [1,3]. Let's check for x in [1,3]:

At x=1: a²/(2) + 0.25. Since a is positive, this is positive.

At x=3: a²/(4) + 0.25. Also positive.

So that's fine.

Wait, but I'm a bit concerned because the wave function has a constant imaginary component. Does that affect the normalization? Because when you compute |ψ|^2, it's the product of the function and its complex conjugate, so the imaginary parts contribute 0.25.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Then ψ* = (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. Then ψ*ψ is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) + (a/sqrt(1+x))(-0.5i). Wait, maybe I should multiply it out correctly.

Wait, no. More accurately:

ψ* ψ = [A + B][A - B] where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B=0.5i.

So it's A² - (B)^2.

A² is [a²/(1+x)].

B squared is (0.5i)^2 = 0.25 i² = -0.25.

So A² - B² = a²/(1+x) - (-0.25) → a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So yes, that part was correct.

So now, the integral becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² = (1-0.5)/ln(2) → (0.5)/(0.6931) ≈ 0.7213 → a≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking back at the options, option B is 0.85.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given wave function:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The probability density is given by the square modulus of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x)\psi(x)
\]

The complex conjugate of \(\psi(x)\) is:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i
\]

Multiplying \(\psi(x)\) and \(\psi^*(x)\):

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 - (0.5i)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 1
\]

1. Compute \(\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx\):
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]

2. Compute \(\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx\):
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Substituting these results back:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solve for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to \(a \approx 0.849\) is **0.85**, which corresponds to **Option B**.
