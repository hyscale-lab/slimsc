Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light, or 0.96c. The nucleus X is given as Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that means it's Lithium-6 because Lithium typically has 3 protons, and adding 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. 

First, I need to remember the formula for relativistic energy. I think the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? Which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So the formula would be E = gamma * m0 * c². But since the options are in GeV, I might need to calculate the rest mass energy in GeV first.

Wait, what's the rest mass of Lithium-6? Let's calculate that. The atomic number for Li is 3, so the nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c² and a neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². So the total rest mass would be (3 * 1.007276) + (3 * 1.008665). Let me compute that: 3*(1.007276 + 1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 GeV/c². So m0 c² is 6.047823 GeV.

Now, the velocity is 0.96c. So v = 0.96c. Let's calculate gamma. Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Plugging in v=0.96c, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

Wait, but is that right? Let me double-check the square root. 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is 10/2.8, but wait, no, 0.28 is 28/100, so 1/0.28 is 100/28. Let me compute that. 100 divided by 28 is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by m0 c². So E = 3.57142857 * 6.047823 GeV.

Let me compute that. Let's do 3.57142857 multiplied by 6.047823.

First, 3 * 6.047823 is 18.143469. Then, 0.57142857 * 6.047823. Hmm, 0.5 times 6.047823 is 3.0239115. 0.07142857 is roughly 1/14, so 6.047823 /14 is approximately 0.432. So adding those: 3.0239115 + 0.432 = approximately 3.4559115. So total E is 18.143469 + 3.4559115 ≈ 21.5994 GeV.

Wait, but that's approximately 21.6 GeV. Looking at the options, option D is 21.419, which is close but a bit lower. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation in gamma.

Wait, let me recalculate gamma more accurately. Let's compute beta squared: (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. So 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So that part was right.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy is more precise? Let me recalculate m0 c² again. For Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Protons are 1.007276 GeV/c² each. Neutrons are 1.008665 GeV/c² each.

So 3*(1.007276) = 3.021828 GeV. 3*(1.008665) = 3.025995 GeV. Sum is 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 GeV. So that's correct.

So gamma is 3.57142857. Multiply by 6.047823 GeV:

Let me compute 3 * 6.047823 = 18.143469. 0.57142857 *6.047823 is approximately:

0.5 *6.047823 =3.0239115
0.07142857 *6.047823 ≈ 0.432 (since 6.047823 * 0.07 ≈ 0.423, 0.00142857 is ~0.0086, so total ~0.4316)
So 3.0239115 +0.4316 ≈3.4555115.

So 18.143469 +3.4555115 = 21.59898 GeV.

So approximately 21.599 GeV. Looking at the options, option D is 21.419, which is a bit lower. Hmm, did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me calculate gamma more accurately. Let me compute beta, which is 0.96. beta squared is 0.96^2=0.9216. 1 - beta squared is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.571428571428571... So no issue there.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the rest mass of the proton and neutron. Wait, let me check the exact masses.

Proton mass (m_p) is approximately 938.272 MeV/c². So in GeV, that's 0.938272 GeV/c².

Neutron mass (m_n) is about 939.565 MeV/c², which is 0.939565 GeV/c².

Wait, wait, so maybe I should recalculate the rest mass of Li-6 using these more precise values.

So m_p = 0.938272 GeV/c², m_n = 0.939565 GeV/c².

So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

3 * 0.938272 = 2.814816 GeV/c².

3 * 0.939565 = 2.818695 GeV/c².

Adding them together: 2.814816 + 2.818695 = 5.633511 GeV/c².

Wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Oh wait, because earlier I used the values in GeV as 1.007276 and 1.008665, which are the atomic mass constants in units where c=1. Wait, maybe I mixed up the units earlier.

Wait, let me clarify. The mass of a proton is approximately 1.007276 atomic mass units (u), and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. But 1 u is about 0.9315 GeV/c². So perhaps I should compute m0 c² in GeV.

So each proton contributes 1.007276 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ 0.938272 GeV.

Similarly, each neutron is 1.008665 u * 0.9315 GeV/u ≈ 0.939565 GeV.

So for Li-6: 3*(0.938272) + 3*(0.939565) = 3*(1.877837) )= 5.633511 GeV.

Wait, that's different from my initial calculation because earlier I used the values in GeV as if they were 1.007 GeV each, but that's incorrect. Oh wait, no, I think I may have made a mistake earlier. Because the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 atomic mass units, which converts to about 0.938272 GeV/c². So yes, the rest mass energy (m0 c²) of Li-6 is 5.633511 GeV.

So earlier, when I thought it was 6.0478 GeV, that was wrong. I think I messed up the unit conversion earlier. So the correct m0 c² is 5.633511 GeV. 

So that's a big difference. Now, recalculating the energy.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.57142857 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that.

First, 3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.57142857 *5.633511 = ?

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511 ≈ 0.07142857 *5.6335 ≈ 0.4035.

So 2.8167555 +0.4035 = 3.220255.

So total E is 16.900533 +3.220255 =20.120788 GeV.

So approximately 20.1208 GeV. 

Looking at the options: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let's do 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me do it step by step.

Multiplying 5.633511 by 3.57142857.

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5*5.633511=2.8167555.

0.07142857 * 5.633511:

Compute 5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.0080528 (since 5.633511 * 0.001=0.0056335; 0.042857 is ~0.000563 *4. So approximately 0.0056335 + 0.0008056 = 0.0064391. Wait, perhaps I should calculate 5.633511 *0.00142857.

0.00142857 is approximately 1/700.

5.633511 /700 ≈ 0.00804787.

So 0.39434577 + 0.00804787 ≈ 0.40239364.

So adding up the parts:

16.900533 +2.8167555 =19.7172885.

Adding the 0.40239364 gives 20.119682 GeV.

So approximately 20.1197 GeV. Rounding to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 20.132 GeV. Close but a bit higher.

Option B is 23.069, which is way higher.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me double-check the calculation of gamma.

v = 0.96c.

Beta (β) = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - β²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²).

Compute 0.96^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857. That's correct.

So, E = 3.57142857 * 5.633511 GeV.

Another approach: 5.633511 * 3.57142857.

Let me compute this more accurately.

Multiplying 5.633511 *3.57142857.

Breaking it into 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

3 *5.633511 =16.900533.

0.5 *5.633511 =2.8167555.

0.07142857 *5.633511.

Let me calculate 5.633511 * 0.07142857.

5.633511 * 0.07 = 0.39434577.

5.633511 * 0.00142857= approx 0.00804787.

So total 0.39434577 +0.00804787=0.40239364.

Adding up all parts: 16.900533 +2.8167555 =19.7172885. Add 0.40239364: 20.119682 GeV.

So 20.1197 GeV. The options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So probably the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Maybe I made a mistake in the neutron or proton mass.

Wait, another source says the exact atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.016049 atomic mass units. Hmm, if that's the case, perhaps I should compute it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the relativistic energy for a single nucleon? No, I think the nucleus as a whole is moving. So the rest mass is for the entire nucleus.

Wait, atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately 6.016049 u. So 6.016049 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

Let me compute that. 6.016049 * 0.931494.

6 *0.931494 =5.588964.

0.016049 *0.931494 ≈0.014958.

So total is approximately 5.588964 +0.014958 =5.603922 GeV.

Wait, but that's the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Hmm, this is a different approach. So maybe I should use the atomic mass of Li-6.

Let me check: the exact mass of Li-6 is 6.016049 u. So m0 c² is 6.016049 u * 0.931494 GeV/u.

So 6.016049 *0.931494 = ?

Compute 6 *0.931494 =5.588964.

0.016049 *0.931494 ≈0.014958.

So sum is 5.588964 +0.014958 =5.603922 GeV.

So that's the rest mass energy. Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.603922 GeV.

Compute that.

3 *5.603922 =16.811766.

0.5 *5.603922 =2.801961.

0.07142857 *5.603922 ≈0.40303.

Adding up: 16.811766 +2.801961 =19.613727.

19.613727 +0.40303 =20.016757 GeV.

Wait, that's about 20.0168 GeV. But earlier when I did 5.6335 GeV, I got 20.1197. Now with 5.603922 GeV, it's about 20.0168 GeV. Hmm, but wait, which approach is correct? Because Li-6 has a mass of 6.016049 u, so the rest mass energy is 5.603922 GeV. So that's the correct approach.

So using 5.603922 GeV as m0 c².

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E =3.57142857 *5.603922 → let me compute that.

3.57142857 *5.603922.

Let me compute 3 *5.603922 =16.811766.

0.5 *5.603922 =2.801961.

0.07142857 *5.603922 ≈0.40303.

So total is 16.811766 +2.801961 =19.613727.

Adding 0.40303 gives 20.016757 GeV.

So around 20.017 GeV. But the options don't have this exact number. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of a single nucleon and then considering the nucleus as a collection of nucleons. But that's not how it works for the nucleus's total energy. The nucleus as a whole has a rest mass which is the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus any binding energy. But for heavy nuclei, the binding energy isn't negligible. But in this problem, perhaps we're to ignore the binding energy and use the sum of individual nucleon masses. So that would give a higher rest mass.

Wait, when I used the individual proton and neutron masses, the sum was 3*(proton) +3*(neutron) =3*(0.938272 +0.939565) =3*(1.877837)=5.633511 GeV. Then E =3.57142857 *5.633511 =20.12 GeV.

But when using the exact mass of the nucleus (6.016049 u), the m0 c² is 5.603922 GeV, leading to E=20.017 GeV.

But the options don't include 20.017. The closest is option C at 20.132. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the sum of individual nucleon masses, leading to 20.12 GeV, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use the atomic mass without considering the precise binding energy.

Also, I'm a bit confused because the rest mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy, but perhaps in this problem, they're approximating by using the sum of the individual masses.

Wait, let me think again: Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is 0.938272 GeV, each neutron is 0.939565 GeV.

So sum is 3*(0.938272 +0.939565) =3*(1.877837) =5.633511 GeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So E=3.57142857 *5.633511 =20.1207 GeV.

Round to four decimal places, that's 20.1207 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Which is a bit higher, but perhaps due to more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2 ) =1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714285714.

So that's correct.

So 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute this with more precision.

5.633511 *3.57142857.

Break it down:

5.633511 *3 =16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5 =2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07 =0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857.

Wait, 0.00142857 is 1/700.

5.633511 * (1/700) =5.633511 /700 ≈0.008047873.

So adding the two parts: 0.39434577 +0.008047873 ≈0.40239364.

So summing all:

16.900533 +2.8167555 =19.7172885.

19.7172885 +0.40239364 =20.119682 GeV.

So E≈20.1197 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but my calculation is 20.1197, which is approximately 20.12 GeV. The option C is 20.132, which is 0.0123 GeV higher. That's about 12 MeV difference. Maybe I should carry more decimal places in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the masses.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of the nucleus is not exactly the sum of the individual nucleons. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

The exact atomic mass of Li-6 is 6.016049 u. So converting to GeV: 6.016049 u * 0.931494 GeV/u = ?

6 *0.931494=5.588964.

0.016049 *0.931494=0.014958.

Total:5.588964 +0.014958=5.603922 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.603922 GeV.

Then, gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.603922.

Compute that.

Let me compute 5.603922 *3.57142857.

Breaking it into 3 +0.5 +0.07142857.

3 *5.603922=16.811766.

0.5 *5.603922=2.801961.

0.07142857 *5.603922= let's compute this accurately.

0.07142857 is 1/14.

5.603922 /14 ≈0.4002801.

So adding up:

16.811766 + 2.801961 =19.613727.

19.613727 +0.4002801 =20.014007 GeV.

So E≈20.014 GeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem expects the sum of individual nucleon masses. Let's stick to that approach.

Thus, the correct energy is approximately 20.12 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach where I used the individual nucleon masses was correct, leading to E=20.12 GeV, which is close to option C.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the calculation.

Let me recalculate 3.57142857 *5.633511.

3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute 5.633511 *3=16.900533.

5.633511 *0.5=2.8167555.

5.633511 *0.07142857.

Compute 5.633511 *0.07=0.39434577.

5.633511 *0.00142857= approx 0.0080528.

So 0.39434577 +0.0080528=0.40239857.

Now, sum all parts:

16.900533 +2.8167555 =19.7172885.

19.7172885 +0.40239857=20.119687 GeV.

Which is 20.1197 GeV. So the answer should be C)20.132 GeV, which is the closest option.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 20.1197, but option C is 20.132, which is 0.0123 GeV higher. That's about 12 MeV. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to use more precise values for the masses.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma. Let me compute gamma with more precision.

v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²) =1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Yes, that's precise.

So perhaps the discrepancy is due to using more precise values for the mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial miscalculation was in the rest mass. Let me check the exact mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has a mass of 6.016049 u.

So 6.016049 u * 0.931494 GeV/u =5.603922 GeV.

But earlier, when using the sum of protons and neutrons, I got 5.6335 GeV. So the difference is about 0.0296 GeV, which is about 29.6 MeV. That's a significant difference.

So E with 5.603922 GeV is 20.014 GeV, which isn't one of the options.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to 20.1197 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D)21.419 GeV, but that would be if the rest mass was about 6 GeV, which would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving relativistically, but the kinetic energy is being asked instead of total energy. No, the question asks for the energy, which is the total energy.

Wait, but maybe the problem is about the kinetic energy. No, the question says 'energy' which implies total energy.

Hmm, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the beam energy per nucleon, but that's not clear. No, the question states the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c, so the entire nucleus's energy is being considered.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C)20.132 GeV, which is close to our calculation of 20.1197 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus \( X \) (Li-6) moves at \( 0.96c \), we calculate the total relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m_0 c^2 \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus, and \( v = 0.96c \).

### Step 1: Rest Mass Energy of Li-6
The atomic mass of Li-6 is \( 6.016049 \, \text{u} \). Converting this to GeV using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 0.931494 \, \text{GeV} \):

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.016049 \cdot 0.931494 \approx 5.603922 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Lorentz Factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]

For \( v = 0.96c \), we calculate:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784, \quad \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857.
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy
Using \( E = \gamma \cdot m_0 c^2 \):

\[
E = 3.57142857 \cdot 5.603922 \approx 20.014 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy \( E \approx 20.014 \, \text{GeV} \) is closest to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The small discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Final Answer
The energy of the RHIC is approximately **20.132 GeV**, corresponding to option C.
