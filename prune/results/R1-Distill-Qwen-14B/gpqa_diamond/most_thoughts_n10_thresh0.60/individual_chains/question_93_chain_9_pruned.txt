Okay, so I'm trying to understand this qPCR question. Hmm, let's see. The scientist is making a calibration curve, which I think is like a standard curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in several concentrations. He ran three technical replicates for each dilution.

Wait, the efficiency is 100%. Oh, right, qPCR efficiency ideally is around 100% for a perfect exponential amplification. But wait, in reality, 100% isn't possible, but maybe here it's just an ideal scenario. The R² is 1, which means the data fits the curve perfectly. So the curve should be a perfect fit, right? The slope was -3.3. I remember that the slope of the standard curve is related to the efficiency. The formula is something like slope = log(e) / slope, or wait, maybe slope = log(e) / (something). Oh wait, the standard curve is usually in the form of Ct = a - (slope) * log(concentration), and the slope is approximately -3.32 when efficiency is 100%. Because log base 10 of e (which is about 2.3026) divided by log(2) is approximately 3.32... Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Oh, right, the slope of a standard curve when efficiency is 100% should be around -3.32. So here, it's -3.3, which is close enough. So the efficiency looks correct.

Looking at the Ct values, let's see. Each dilution is 10-fold. The first concentration is 100,000 copies per µl, Ct's are around 34. Then 10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. 1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3.

Wait, each dilution is 10-fold, so each should differ by about 3.3 cycles (
