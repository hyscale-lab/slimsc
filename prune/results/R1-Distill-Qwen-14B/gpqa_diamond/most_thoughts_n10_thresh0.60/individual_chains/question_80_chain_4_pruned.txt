Okay, I've got this problem here about an algorithm that converts some input strings into numbers. Hmm, I need to figure out the pattern so I can apply it to the given input and find the correct output. Let me think through this step by step.

So the examples given are:

AGG -> 115
TGCTGA -> 176

And the question is what value does ACAGTGACC give? The options are A) 315, B) 185, C) 333, D) 351.

Wait, I'm not exactly a bioinformatics expert, but maybe this has to do with some kind of DNA sequence encoding. Like, each nucleotide is converted to a number and then summed or something like that.

Let me break down the first example: AGG is 115.

A, G, G. So each letter is a nucleotide. What's the numerical value of each? Let's think. A is 1, T is 2, C is 3, G is 4? Or maybe A=0, T=1, etc.? Or perhaps A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Let me check.

Wait, in some encoding schemes, it's A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me test that.

For AGG: A is 1, G is 4, G is 4. So 1 + 4 +4 = 9. But the output is 115, which is way bigger. So that can't be it.

Alternatively, maybe each base is represented by a two-digit number. Like A=1, C=2, G=3, T=4. Wait, but that would be the same as before, but adding them up gives 1+3+3=7, which is still way less than 115.

Hmm, maybe it's not a simple sum. Maybe it's something else. Let me think about other possibilities.

Another idea: perhaps each nucleotide is converted into a binary digit, and those are concatenated and then converted into a decimal number. For example, A=00, T=01, C=10, G=11. But wait, that would be binary digits. Let me test that.

Wait, AGG would be A=00, G=11, G=11. So concatenated, it's 001111. Let's
