Okay, so I have this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem gives a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I misread that. Oh, right, the interaction is between a bosonic field X and fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

So, I remember that for a boson like this to decay into fermions, it has to couple to those fermions. The decay products must satisfy conservation laws, and the energy must be sufficient. Also, the fermions must be light enough so that the X can produce them.

Looking at the Lagrangian, it seems like X is interacting with fermions via some coupling. The term looks like it's a Yukawa interaction, which typically couples a scalar (or boson) to fermions. The general form is something like L_int = -g ψ ψ X, where ψ are fermion fields.

So, the decay process would be X → fermion-antifermion pair. The possible decay channels depend on which fermions X can interact with. Also, the fermions' masses must be less than or equal to half the mass of X, since in the decay X→ff̄, each fermion would carry at most half the mass (assuming the rest is kinetic energy, which is allowed as long as it's above the threshold). 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Wait, but wait—fermion masses are usually given for their particles, but let me think: the rest mass is the same for particle and antiparticle, so each would need to be m_f ≤ 3 GeV. But wait, X is a boson, so when it decays, it can produce any fermion pair where the sum of the rest masses is less than or equal to 6 GeV. Oh wait, no, because in decay, the total rest mass of the products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. So for X →
