Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm. Alright, let's try to break it down.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y) (v + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh right, I think λf is the coupling constant for each fermion species f. So X is a boson that couples to these fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into.

In particle physics, for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the rest mass of the boson is enough to create the particles.

Wait, so the boson X has mass 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that it can decay into must have each fermion's mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV).

But wait, I should remember the
