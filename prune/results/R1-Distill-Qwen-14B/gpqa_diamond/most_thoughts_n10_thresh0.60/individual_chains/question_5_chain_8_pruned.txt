Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, like a muon, the Pauli matrices are used for the components of the spin operator. So maybe P is the spin operator here.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I'm looking for an eigenvector of the operator P along direction n with this eigenvalue. Since n lies in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented using polar angles, but maybe theta is measured from the z-axis, and phi is the azimuthal angle. But since it's in the x-z plane, phi would be 0 or pi, perhaps? Wait, no, wait. Actually, the x-z plane is the one where the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n would have components (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since φ is typically measured from the x-axis, and if it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or 180 degrees. Or maybe I should think in terms of just theta, the angle from the z-axis, because phi is zero here.

The operator P along an arbitrary direction n is given by P · n, right? So that would be P_x times n_x plus P_y times n_y plus P_z times n_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the eigenvector is for the operator P along n, which is spin in the direction of n. So the eigenvalue equation is (P · n) |ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because usually, the spin operator S (or P here) has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we're looking for the +1 eigenstate along direction n.

So
