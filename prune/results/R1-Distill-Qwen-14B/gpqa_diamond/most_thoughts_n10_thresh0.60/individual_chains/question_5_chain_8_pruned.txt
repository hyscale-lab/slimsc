Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue corresponding to this eigenvector is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each component is given as (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

I'm supposed to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options are given as A, B, C, D. 

Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin in a particular direction (like the Pauli matrices) can be expressed as a combination of the x, y, z components weighted by the direction's components. Since the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, the operator P would be the sum of the Pauli matrices scaled by the components of n.

Wait, actually, the operator for spin along a direction n is given by ħ/2 times (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), right? Because the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if the direction is n, then S·n would be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z).

But in this problem, the operator P is given as having components P_x, P_y, P_z. So I think the operator P is the spin operator along the direction n. So P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z? Wait, no. Wait, no, because each component like P_x is already (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix. So P_x is (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2) [[0,-i],[i,0]], P_z is (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator for spin along a direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Because when you have spin in direction (nx, ny, nz), the operator is nx Sx + ny Sy + nz Sz, and each S component is (ħ/2)σ, so P would be (ħ/2)(nx σx + ny σy + nz σz). 

Wait, but our P components are already (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So yes, the operator P is (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz) = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, that means the y-component of n is zero. So n = (n_x, 0, n_z). And since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So n_x = cosθ perhaps, and n_z = sinθ? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z
