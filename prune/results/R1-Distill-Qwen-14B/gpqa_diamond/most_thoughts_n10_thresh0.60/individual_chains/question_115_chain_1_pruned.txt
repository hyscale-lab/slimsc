Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says: An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to think about what happens when an electron and positron collide. They annihilate each other, producing gamma photons. But wait, in this case, they produce two photons. So I remember that in annihilation, the conservation laws must hold — conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me jot down what I know. The electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). Both are along the same horizontal line. Their Lorentz factors are given: the electron has a Lorentz factor (gamma) of 4, and the positron has gamma of 2.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma equals total energy divided by rest mass energy. The rest mass for an electron and positron is the same, right? So the electron's energy would be gamma*m*c², and the positron's energy is gamma'*m*c². Since they are annihilating, their total energy should go into the photons.

But wait, the problem says that both photons have the same energy. So the two photons have equal energy. That's interesting. Because photons don't have mass, their momentum is E/c, and direction matters.

So, since the initial system (electron + positron) must conserve both energy and momentum, the two photons must carry away equal and opposite momenta in their vectors, but their energies are the same. Hmm, but why would they have the same energy and opposite directions? Or wait, no—because if their directions are upper-right and lower-right, they must have some angle between them.

Wait, the problem says one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, but one is above the axis and the other is below. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis, perhaps? That might make sense because the initial system's momentum is along the horizontal axis. So the photons' moment
