Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that the metric tells us about the geometry of the space. So this looks like a two-dimensional metric since it's in terms of dx and dy.

Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Oh right, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is like a saddle shape. The area of such a surface might have some relation to the Gaussian curvature.

The area element in a metric is usually found by taking the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. So the metric here is diagonal, with components g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²) and g_yy = same as g_xx. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of that would be 32/(4 - x² - y²), so the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, pseudosphere radius r=2. So in the metric, the denominator is 4 - x² - y². Oh, 4 is 2 squared, so that makes sense. So when r=2
