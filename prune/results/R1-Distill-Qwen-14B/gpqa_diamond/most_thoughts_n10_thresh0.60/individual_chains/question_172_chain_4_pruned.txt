Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember that when it comes to stars, the photosphere's properties relate to their temperature. The question mentions two stars, star_1 and star_2. The iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of the populations of two energy levels is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant.

So the ratio of excited to ground state (or some lower state) would be (n2)/(n1) = exp( -Î”E/(k T) ). Wait, but wait. The question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the population ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. 

Wait, no, let me make this clearer. Let me denote the populations. Let's say for star_1, the number of atoms in that energy level is n1, and for star_2 it's n2. According to the question, n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, wait, no. The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation is
