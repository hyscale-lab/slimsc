Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I guess that means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, right, the Boltzmann distribution equation relates the number of particles in different energy levels to the temperature. The formula is something like N_i / N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k_B T) ). I think E_i is the higher energy level here because the excitation is higher. Oh, but wait, in this case, the iron atoms in star_1 are more excited, so maybe the population in the higher energy level is higher there.

The energy difference is given as delta E = 1.38e-23 J. Let me note that down. So, E_i - E_j = delta E = 1.38e-23 J.

The ratio of excitation (N_i/N_j) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, no, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so maybe N_i,N_j for star_1 is such that N_i/N_j is higher. Oh, but wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Or maybe star_1 has a higher N_i (excited state) compared to N_j (ground state), so ratio N1_i/N1_j is 2 times N2_i/N2_j.

Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think that means the excitation (or the population in the higher energy level) is twice as much. So for each star, the ratio of N_i to N_j is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star_1, it's higher than for star_2, because star_1's excitation is higher.

So let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = N1_i / N1_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - delta E / (k_B T1) )
Similarly, for star_2, R2 = N2_i / N2_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - delta E / (k_B T2) )

But wait, the problem says that the excitation is twice as high for star_1. So I think R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, or perhaps R1 = 2 R2? Or maybe the ratio of R1 to R2 is 2? Because star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2.

Wait, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps the ratio R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting R1 and R2 from Boltzmann:

(g_i/g_j) * exp( - delta E/(k_B T1) ) = 2 * [ (g_i/g_j) * exp( - delta E/(k_B T2) ) ]

Oh, because both R1 and R2 are multiplied by (g_i/g_j), which I'm assuming is the same for both stars since we're talking about the same element in the same energy levels. So g_i and g_j are same for both stars, so when we take R1/R2, those terms cancel.

So R1/R2 = [ exp(-delta E/(k_B T1)) ] / [ exp(-delta E/(k_B T2)) ] =
