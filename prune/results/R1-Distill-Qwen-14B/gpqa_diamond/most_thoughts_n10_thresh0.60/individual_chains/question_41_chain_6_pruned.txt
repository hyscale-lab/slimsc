Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my optics, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is given as 1 here. So in the glass, the speed would be 1/n. But wait, how does the movement of the glass affect this?

Ah, this must be a problem involving relative velocity. Because the glass is moving, the observer in the lab would perceive the light's speed differently than in the rest frame of the glass. Wait, but light speed is always c in any inertial frame, right? No, wait, noâ€”because light's speed in different media changes according to the medium's properties. Or does it? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. In special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c regardless of the observer's motion. But in a medium, the speed depends on the medium's properties. So when the medium (glass) is moving, how does that affect the measured speed of light within it?

Wait, maybe
