Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let me start by understanding what the question is asking. 

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 200 mL. There are 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I remember that when it comes to concentrations, moles are important. So I guess I need to find the moles of each of these compounds first.

Wait, the molar masses are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. So for each, I'll do grams divided by molar mass to get moles.

Calculating moles of KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol = approximately 0.00734 moles. Let me check that division... 136.09 times 0.00734 is roughly 1 gram. Yeah, that's right.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me compute that. 177.99 is about 178, so 1/178 is roughly 0.00562. So about 0.00562 moles.

Now, what about the solution volume? 200 mL is 0.2 liters. So the concentrations in terms of molarity would be moles divided by volume in liters.

So, for KH2PO4: 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M. And for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.00562 /0.2 = 0.0281 M.

Wait, but what about the dissociation of these compounds? I remember that KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So each mole of KH2PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and the water molecules, which probably don't affect the ions much. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions from these salts.

Now, the question is about orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate would be PO4^3- right? Because H3PO4 can lose three protons to become PO4^3-. But wait, in solution, the phosphate exists in different forms depending on pH.

I think the problem involves the phosphate buffer system. Since H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donating a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accepting a proton to become H3PO4). But since we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, this looks like a buffer solution.

Wait, but the orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form. To get PO4^3-, we need to deprotonate HPO4^2- further. But the third dissociation constant is given as Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So, the equilibrium for HPO4^2- deprotonating is:

HPO4^2- <-> H+ + PO4^3-

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, in solution, if the pH is high enough, HPO4^2- will dissociate to form PO4^3-.

But wait, the presence of H2PO4^- will influence the pH. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe
