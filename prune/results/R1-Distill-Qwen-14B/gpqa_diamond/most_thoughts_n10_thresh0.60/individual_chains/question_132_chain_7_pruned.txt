Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let's try breaking this down step by step.

First, the question says it's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. Hmm, wait, C10H14. Let me think about that. The molecular formula for benzene is C6H6. If I replace some H's with methyl groups, each methyl adds one C and three H's. Wait, but waitâ€”each methyl group is CH3. So each substitution adds a methyl group, so for each substitution, the formula becomes C7H7? Wait, no, wait. Benzene is C6H6. If I substitute one H with a CH3, the formula becomes C7H7 (because 6 C + 1 C =7, and 6 H -1 H +3 H =8 H? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Benzene is C6H6. Each substitution replaces an H with a CH3 group. So each substitution adds (CH3 - H). So each substitution adds 2 H's and one C. Because CH3 has 3 H, replacing one H gives 3-1=2 more H per substitution.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula of the compound can help. The compound is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here. So C=10, H=14. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 =8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. Benzene has three (from the ring) plus each substitution doesn't add any (since it's just a ring with substituents). But wait, the initial formula suggests a benzene ring (which contributes 4 degrees: 3 from the ring, 1 from the double bonds, but maybe that's another way).

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. The options are all tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which has diethyl. Let me check the options again.

Option C is 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would
