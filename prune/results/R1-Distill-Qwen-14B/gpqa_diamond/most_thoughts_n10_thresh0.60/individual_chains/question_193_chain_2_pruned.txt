Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance based on the given parallax relation. 

Alright, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I recall is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the parallax is smaller, the distance is larger, right?

The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Wait, that means N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to find how N changes with distance, not parallax.

Since plx is inversely proportional to distance (d), I can write plx = 1/d. So plx is 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the equation.

So N is proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 divided by that would be d^5. So N is proportional to d^5?

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. If N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx =1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, wait. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, so per unit distance, like how does the density change as a function of r.

Wait, no. The question is about the number of stars in a region of the sky as a function of distance. So the number of stars is proportional to d^5? That seems steep. But let's think about the options.

The options are about how the number changes with r. So the number of stars per unit volume or something? Or is it per unit distance? Hmm, the question says "per unit range of distance, r." So maybe it's the number of stars per a certain distance interval, like how many stars exist between r and r + dr.

Wait, but when we talk about the number of stars in a region, perhaps it's a volume consideration. The number density would depend on the volume, which depends on distance. Let me clarify.

Parallax is 1/d, so 1/plx = d. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(
