Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, right, that's a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest initially, which probably means we can use conservation of energy and momentum here.

The rest masses are given: the pion (Pi(+)) has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon (mu(+)) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino, I think, has a negligible mass, so we can treat it as massless.

Hmm, so the pion is Pi(+) at rest, so its total energy is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. Since it's stationary, the initial momentum is zero. So the total energy and momentum of the products must balance that.

In the decay products, we have the muon and the neutrino. Let me denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's energy as E_nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the muon and neutrino must be zero. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is the pion's rest energy, 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's energy. So,

E_pion = E_mu + E_nu.

But the neutrino is massless, so its energy is equal to its momentum times c, but I'll probably work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So E_nu = |p_nu|.

Similarly, for the muon, which has rest mass m_mu = 105.7 MeV. Its energy is given by the relativistic energy equation:

E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2.

Wait, but since I'm using units where c=1, that simplifies to E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ).

But the pion is at rest, so the total momentum of the products must be zero. So the muon's momentum p_mu must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum p_nu. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction. So, the total momentum is zero.

So, E_pion = E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Because E_nu = p.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. So,

139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + 105.7^2 ) + p.

Hmm, that's the equation I need to solve for p. Once I find p, I
