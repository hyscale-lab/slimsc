Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Let me think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to figure it out.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Hmm, expectation value, right. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state vector.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I can split this into two parts: 10σz and 5σx. The expectation value will then be the sum of the expectation values of each part. Because expectation values are linear, so ⟨A+B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since σz has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, and the particle is in a superposition of these, the expectation value is just the probability of each state multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, the eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. The coefficients are the amplitudes. The probabilities are the square of the absolute values of these coefficients.

Calculating the probabilities: |0.5|^2 is 0.25 and |√3/2|^2 is (3/4) because (√3/2)^2 is 3/4.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (probability of up) * (+1) + (probability of down) * (-1) = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value for 10σz is 10 * ⟨σz⟩ = 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to the next part: 5σx. The expectation value will be 5 * ⟨σx⟩.

What's ⟨σx⟩? σx is the Pauli X matrix. Oh wait, σx doesn't have the same eigenstates as σz. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩.

But wait, our state is in the σz basis. So I think I need to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ directly.

The state ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) written as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), so ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

σx is the Pauli matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So let's compute ψ† σx
