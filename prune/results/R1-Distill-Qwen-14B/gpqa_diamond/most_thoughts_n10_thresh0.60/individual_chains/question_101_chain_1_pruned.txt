Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the given options.

Hmm, so the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine, right? So 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon of the pyrrolidine ring. 

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me try to visualize that. So the product has a substituent attached to the pyrrolidine ring at position 1. The substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Wait, cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond, right? So cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene (CH2) group. So the structure is like a cyclohexene ring connected to the pyrrolidine via a CH2.

Wait, but how does this substitution happen? The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. So the reaction is adding something to the pyrrolidine ring. Acid-catalyzed reactions often involve things like alkylation or acylation. But given the product, maybe it's an alkylation.

Alternatively, another possibility is that compound A is undergoing some kind of addition to the pyrrolidine. Wait, pyrrolidine is a secondary amine. In acid-catalyzed reactions, amines can undergo various reactions. For instance, they can act as nucleophiles in alkylation or acylation. But since the product has a cyclohexylidene group, perhaps it's an alkylation where the cyclohexene is being attached.

Wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde is an aldehyde with a cyclohexane ring attached. Vinylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring attached to
