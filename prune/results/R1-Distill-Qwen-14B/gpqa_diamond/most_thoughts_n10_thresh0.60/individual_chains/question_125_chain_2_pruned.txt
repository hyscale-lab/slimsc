Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator. So the force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -kx, and in this case, k is m ω squared. 

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. Hmm, I remember that in quantum harmonic oscillators, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers. But wait, since this is a three-dimensional isotropic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each dimension.

Wait, no, in three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Or wait, is it n_x + n_y + n_z? Oh right, in three dimensions, the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z are each non-negative integers, and the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

But wait another thing—I think in three dimensions, the energy levels can be labeled by a single quantum number n, where n = n_x + n
