Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that stability constants are involved in complexation reactions, where a metal ion binds with ligands to form complexes. The higher the stability constant, the more stable the complex is.

The first thing I need to figure out is which complex corresponds to the blue dithiocyanato species. Dithiocyanato would mean two thiocyanate ligands. So, probably it's the Co(SCN)_n where n=2. Looking at the β values, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, but in this case, β4 is 16 which is lower than β3. That might complicate things. But I shouldn't let that distract me; perhaps the problem is assuming the complexes are in order of increasing n. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.

The question is about the percentage of the blue complexes, which I think is Co(SCN)₂²+. So, that's the complex with two thiocyanate ions. So, that would be the second complex, since β2 is for the second formation step. Wait, no, β2 is the second formation step, but the total β for the second complex (like Co(SCN)_2) would be β1 multiplied by β2. Or is β2 the overall stability constant for the Co(SCN)₂ complex?

Wait, correction: Stability constants are for each step. So, the formation of Co(SCN)_n would have a cumulative stability constant. So, the first step is Co²+ + SCN⁻ → CoSCN²−
