Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. The given information includes their radii, masses, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest, and their radial velocities. The task is to find out by what factor the luminosity of Star 1 is greater than Star 2. The options are A to D, each a number around 2.2 something. 

Hmm, so let me break down the given data:

- Radius of Star 1 is 1.5 times that of Star 2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- Mass of Star 1 is also 1.5 times that of Star 2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The peak wavelengths of both stars are the same. Oh right, that's from spectroscopy. So lambda1 equals lambda2.
- Radial velocities: Star 1 has 0 km/s, and Star 2 has 700 km/s. But I'm not sure how radial velocity plays into this. Maybe it relates to Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelength?

Wait, the question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies. So luminosity would be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

But wait, the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. For a black body, the peak wavelength is related to the temperature by Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures should be the same. Because if lambda_max is equal, then T1 = T2. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait—radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. So Star 2 is moving towards or away from us? Radial velocity is 700 km/s. But the problem says for Star 1, it's zero. So if Star 2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be blueshifted. If moving away, redshifted. But the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the observed lambda is the same, but their actual emitted lambda is different?

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. When a star emits light, its spectrum is Doppler shifted if it's moving relative to us. But the peak wavelength detected would be shifted. So the observed peak wavelength lambda_observed = lambda_emitted * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Or is it (1 - v_r/c) if moving towards? I think the Doppler shift formula is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r /
