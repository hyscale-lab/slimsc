Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. Let's see what the target molecule is.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me draw that structure mentally. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Oh wait, wait. Wait, benzene numbering. So when numbering, the substituents should be in the lowest possible numbers. Hmm, but the question specifies the positions as 1,2,3, so that's the arrangement.

So the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So the benzene ring has three substituents in a meta arrangement? Wait, 1, 2, 3 are consecutive, so that would be a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Wait, no, because 1 and 3 are two positions apart. So positions 1,2,3 would be three consecutive positions. So the substituents are at adjacent positions.

Wait, maybe I should think about the directing effects of each substituent. Because when you add substituents to benzene, the position where the next substituent adds depends on the nature of the existing groups.

In aromatic substitution, activating groups (like -OEt, which is an ether, so it's an activating group because of the lone pairs on O) are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups (like nitro) are meta directors.

So the order of addition matters a lot for where the substituents end up.

The target molecule has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let's think about their positions. The ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's number the benzene ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nit
