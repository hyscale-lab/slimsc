Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the CMB photons. Hmm, I think I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, right? And the energy of those photons is really low. The question says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. 

The process mentioned is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs. So the reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I remember that this process is one of the ways high-energy photons can lose energy, especially in the early universe or in certain astrophysical environments.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this process. So I think it's about finding the energy where the annihilation rate is so high that the photon can't survive for the age of the universe; hence, its lifetime is effectively limited by this interaction.

I remember that the interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons. The cross-section for this process probably increases with the energy of the gamma-ray. Wait, or does it? I think at high energies, the cross-section for pair production (like gamma-gamma → e+e-) actually decreases because it's an inverse Compton effect or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the cross-section for pair production from gamma-gamma collisions has a certain behavior. For energies much higher than the rest mass of the electron (which is about 0.511 MeV), the cross-section goes like 1/sqrt(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. So when the gamma-ray energy is high, the cross-section is lower. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct.

Another approach: the photon's mean lifetime is determined by the inverse of the interaction rate. So the lifetime τ is ~1/(nσv), where n is the number density of target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity or something like that. Wait, actually, the interaction rate Γ is nσv, and the lifetime τ is 1/Γ.

So the lifetime is inversely proportional to the product of the number density, cross-section, and velocity. But the cross-section for pair production from two photons depends on the energy. Let me think about how σ depends on the photon energies.
