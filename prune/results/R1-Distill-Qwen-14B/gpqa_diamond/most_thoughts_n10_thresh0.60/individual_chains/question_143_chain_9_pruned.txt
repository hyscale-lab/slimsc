Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the Pinacol-Pinacolone rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Pinacol rearrangement involves a molecule with two adjacent alcohol groups. When treated with acid, one of the OH groups gets protonated, and then a 1,2-hydride shift occurs, leading to the formation of a ketone. 

The question has two parts, right? The first is to find the starting material A that gives 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one when reacted with H2SO4. The second part is to find product B when methyl 2,3-dihydroxy-2-(p-tolyl)butanoate reacts under the same conditions. 

Let me tackle the first part first. The product is 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the product has a cyclohexanone ring with two p-tolyl groups attached to the same carbon (carbon 2). The starting material must be a diol (two adjacent OH groups) that can rearrange into this structure.

In the Pinacol rearrangement, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons. When the acid is added, one OH gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, a hydride or alkyl shift occurs to form the ketone. So, the starting material should have two OH groups next to each other, and when the shift happens, the two p-tolyl groups end up on the same carbon adjacent to the ketone.

Looking at the product, 2,2-di-p-tolylcyclohexan-1-one, that's a six-membered ring. The ketone is at position 1, and positions 2 has two p-tolyl groups. So, the starting diol should be a cyclohexanol derivative with two adjacent OH groups and p-tolyl substituents. 

Wait, the product is a cyclohexanone, so the starting material is probably a cyclohexane diol. Let's imagine the structure. The diol would have two OH groups on adjacent carbons. Then, after the rearrangement, those positions would lose an OH and gain a ketone.

Wait, no, wait. When the diol undergoes the Pinacol rearrangement, the two adjacent OH groups are on a structure that can form a carbocation. So, one OH is protonated, leaving as water, and the adjacent carbon becomes a carbocation. Then a hydride shift occurs, moving a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon to form the ketone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,2-diol structure where the two OHs are on adjacent carbons, which upon acid treatment, one of them becomes a better leaving group, leading to a carbocation, and then a hydride or alkyl shift forms the ketone.

Wait, the product has two p-tolyl groups on the same carbon (carbon 2 of the cyclohexanone). So the starting material must have the two p-tolyl groups on adjacent carbons to each other and adjacent to the OH groups. Or perhaps
