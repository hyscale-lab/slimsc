Okay, so I have this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. From what I recall, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

The options are four different organic molecules. I'll go through each one and see if they fit.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, that sounds like it has multiple phenyl groups attached. The name suggests a complex structure with perhaps three benzene rings connected in a certain way. Maybe it's a corannulene or something similar? Wait, corannulene is a bowl-shaped molecule, and I'm not sure about its symmetry. Alternatively, if it's a trifuran with phenyl substituents, maybe each phenyl is placed symmetrically.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Benzo tricyclic structures might be more planar. If it's a benzo-fused furan system, perhaps it's similar to benzene in some symmetry. Wait, benzene itself is D6h symmetric, but this is a fused system. Maybe it's less symmetric.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. That's a borate ester, probably with three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Boron usually has three substituents in such compounds. Triisopropyl borate—I think its structure is a trigonal planar around boron, so the molecule should have some symmetry. Wait, each isopropyl group is a CH(CH3)2. Are all three isopropyl groups arranged symmetrically around boron? If so, the
