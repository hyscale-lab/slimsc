Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels for a single particle are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. That E is given as π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² E.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, right? So they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. In a 1D well, the quantum number is just n, but for spin-1/2 particles, they have spin up or down. So each energy level can hold two particles because of the two possible spins.

So for four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

Let me think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. The first energy level is n=1. Since each n can hold two particles (spin up and down), putting two particles in n=1 is allowed. Then the next two particles would go into n=2. Because after filling n=1, the next available is n=2. So the ground state configuration would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the energy of the ground state is the sum of their individual energies. Each in n=1 contributes E*(1²) = E. So two of them is 2E. Each in n=2 contributes E*(2²)=4E, so two of them is 8E. Total ground state energy is 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, let me double-check. No, wait, the particles are indistinct fermions, so the ground state is the lowest possible state where each particle is in the lowest available orbitals with unique quantum states.

Wait, but each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. So the first two particles go into n=1, spin up and down. The next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So for four particles, they fill n=1 and n=2 completely.

So the ground state energy is 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So ground state is 10E.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. The total energy is the sum of each individual's energy. So each of the four particles has their own energy. Two are at n=1 (E each), two at n=2 (4E each). So sum is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E =10E. So the ground state energy is 10E. But let me check the options.

Wait looking at the options, option A is 30E, 39E,50E. Option B is 4, 10,50. Option C is4,10,15
