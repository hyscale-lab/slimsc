Okay, I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the confocal microscopy. Let me go through the setup step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They've created a bicistronic vector with both the ligand and receptor. The vector has loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. 

The ligand is fused to mCherry at the 5' end, and the receptor has eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES, which allows for internal ribosome entry, so both ligand and receptor can be expressed from the same transcript but separately, right?

So, when the vector is transfected, without Cre, the ligand and receptor are both under the control of these stop cassettes. The ligand is before the stop, and the receptor after another stop. So without Cre, the stop cassettes block expression. But when Cre is present, it recombines the lox sites, removing the stops so both can be expressed.

But wait, in the setup, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I believe. So the Cre should be active in neural crest-derived cells, like astrocytes perhaps. So the Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the offspring, they don't see a green signal. The eGFP is on the receptor. So why wouldn't it fluoresce?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the construct is in the same cell, so they should be expressed in the same cell. If the ligand is secreted, maybe, but the question says it's a coiled-coil, which might imply it's membrane-bound? Or maybe it's a secreted protein? Not sure how paracrine would prevent eGFP expression. Maybe if ligand is secreted, and the receptor is on the same cell, but the eGFP wouldn't be expressed unless the vector is working. But the problem is about expression, not function.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. That would prevent proper trafficking to the cell surface, so you wouldn't see fluorescence. But how would that happen? Maybe a stop codon or frame shift. But the vector design has the stop before the receptor, unless Cre didn't recombine properly. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is being added correctly.

Option C: Enhancer missing. The construct might not be expressed because the regulatory elements are missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong. The receptor uses IRES. So unless the IRES isn't working, but that's less likely. If the stop was in the way and Cre didn't remove it, but the question says they used SOX10-Cre, which should activate it in the right cells.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not in frame, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed. But the vector was made with the receptor's ORF and eGFP fused. Maybe during the cloning, the stop cassette wasn't spliced correctly, or the frame was messed up. So when Cre removes the stop, the receptor and eGFP may be in the same reading frame. If not, the eGFP might not be expressed properly. But wait, the vector's design is that the receptor is at the 3' end, after the IRES. So the ORF for the receptor is separate from the ligand, using the IRES to allow internal ribosome entry. So the eGFP should be correctly spliced and in frame.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The first ORF is ligand with mCherry, then the IRES, and then the receptor with eGFP. So, the mRNA is one transcript, with the IRES allowing the ribosome to translate the receptor separately.

But the stop cassettes: the ligand has a stop in between it and mCherry, but that's flanked by loxP. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are excised, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272. So after Cre recombination, both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the experiment, they tested the construct expression via Western blot. The total proteins showed actin loading, which is fine. Antibodies were raised
