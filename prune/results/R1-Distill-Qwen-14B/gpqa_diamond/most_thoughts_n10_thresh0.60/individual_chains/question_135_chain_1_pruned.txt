Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by the Lagrangian:

L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. And the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different decay channels.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a boson decays, the decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of the boson. Also, considering the interaction terms, the boson can only decay into fermions that it couples to.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term is λ f ψ̄_f X ψ_f. So this looks like X coupling to fermions, similar to how the Higgs field couples. The term ψ̄_f X ψ_f suggests that X has a Yukawa coupling to the fermion f.

Wait, Yukawa interactions are usually for particles like the Higgs, which couples to fermions with a mass term. So the decay of X would involve X turning into a pair of fermions: X → f f̄.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. But wait, each fermion in the pair has a certain mass, so the sum is twice that mass (since each has mass m, so 2m must be ≤ 6 GeV) → m ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV? Let me list the known fermion masses.

Quarks have masses like up and down (light, around a few MeV), strange (about 100 MeV?), charm is about 1.5 GeV, bottom is about 4.5 GeV, top is around 173 GeV. For leptons: electron is 0.5 MeV, muon ~105 MeV, tau ~1.78 GeV. Neutrinos are negligible, but we can ignore them here since the problem doesn't mention them.

Wait, but wait: the fermions in the decay must be such that their pair's total mass is less than 6 GeV. So for each pair f f̄, 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's see which fermions satisfy this:

Electron (0.5 MeV): yes, definitely.

Muon (~105 MeV): yes.

Tau (~1.78 GeV): 1.78 < 3, so yes.

Charm quark is about 1.5 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So yes.

Strangeness quark is around 100 MeV, so yes.

Up and down quarks are a few MeV, yes.

What about the bottom quark? Its mass is about 4.5 GeV. 4.5 *2 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because 2*4.5 =9>6. Similarly, top quark is way too heavy, so no.

What about the other quarks: c is okay, s, u, d are okay.

So the possible fermion pairs X can decay into are:

e+ e- : yes.

mu+ mu-: yes.

tau+ tau-: yes.

u ū: yes.

d d̄: yes.

s s̄: yes.

c c̄: yes.

But wait, what about the top quark? No, as I said, too heavy.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: includes b sbar, etc
