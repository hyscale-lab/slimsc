Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Hmm, let me try to unpack it step by step.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that move at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A) 54, B) 68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, okay. So I think this has to do with the lifetime of the particles and how far they travel before decaying. Because if they decay quickly, they won't reach the detector walls. So the detector's radius must relate to the distance the particles can travel before decaying.

I remember that in relativity, the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor γ gives the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. So the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by its speed. But wait, at ultra-relativistic speeds, the speed is approximately the speed of light c. So the time t is approximately radius / c.

So, the time available for the particle to travel before decaying is t = R / (βc), where β is v/c. Since it's ultra-relativistic, β is very close to 1, so t ≈ R/c.

The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is γ times the proper lifetime τ. So the condition for the particle to reach the wall is that γτ >= t. So that's γτ >= R/(βc). But since β is approximately 1, we can simplify this to γτ >= R/c.

Wait, but for the particle to decay before reaching the wall, the proper lifetime τ must be such that τ < (t)/γ = (R)/(c γ). So if τ is fixed, the probability of decay depends on how much time t is available compared to τ.

But in this problem, it's about the fraction of particles that reach the wall. So when the Lorentz factor is higher, γ is larger, the particles live longer in the lab frame, so more of them would reach the wall. That makes sense because a higher γ means less time dilation, wait no, wait: wait, no, wait. Wait, no— higher γ means more time dilation, so the particle's lifetime as seen in the lab is longer. So particles can travel farther. So when γ is higher, more particles reach the wall.

Wait, but the original scenario is that at γ=20, one third reach the wall. So we need to find a γ such that two-thirds reach the wall. So that would require a higher γ than 20, because higher γ makes more particles reach the wall.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The fraction that reach the wall depends on the ratio of the proper lifetime to the time available. So for a particle, the probability of decaying is roughly 1 - e^(-t/(τ)), but for small t/τ, this approximates to t/(τ). So if t/(τ) is small, most particles don't decay. So the fraction that decay is roughly t/(τ), and the fraction that reach the wall is 1 - t/(τ).

Wait, but in our case, one third reach the wall, so two-thirds decay. So 1 - (t/(τ)) = 1/3 → t/(τ) = 2/3. Hmm, wait no, wait. Wait, if a particle doesn't decay, it reaches the wall. So the fraction reaching the wall is the fraction that don't decay. So the fraction that decay is (1 - fraction_reaching).

So if 1/3 reach the wall, then 2/3 decay. So t/(τ) ≈ 2/3. So t = (2/3) τ.

But the time available t is R/(βc), which is approximately R/c since β ≈1. So t ≈ R/c → R/(c) = (2/3) τ → τ = (3 R)/(2 c).

Wait, but the time τ is the proper lifetime, which is fixed for each particle. So when the Lorentz factor increases, the lab frame lifetime increases as γτ. So the time available in the lab frame is t = R/(c β), which is approximately R/c.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should model the decay length. The decay length L is c * γ τ. Because the lifetime in the lab is γ τ, so the distance is speed (v≈c) times that. So L = v γ τ ≈ c γ τ.

So for a particle to reach the detector wall, the decay length L must be greater than R. So L > R → c γ τ > R → γ τ > R/c.

But wait, in the initial
