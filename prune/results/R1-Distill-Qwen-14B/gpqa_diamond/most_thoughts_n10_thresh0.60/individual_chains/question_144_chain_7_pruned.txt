Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. And I need to find the mean decay distance, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The options are A to D, with various numbers in meters. 

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula is something like L = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c). 

But wait, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check the units and constants involved here.

So, let's break it down step by step. First, calculate the lifetime τ. The width Γ is given in MeV, which is 320 MeV. I remember that when using natural units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, but wait, units can be tricky here. Let me make sure.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. And 1 MeV is 1e6
