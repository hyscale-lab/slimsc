Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A through D with various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by its lifetime. So the formula would be something like distance = c * τ, where τ is the mean lifetime.

But wait, how do I find τ? Oh, right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. I think the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, or τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, no, wait. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a particle, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime. Oh wait, the relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is the energy uncertainty in the particle's rest frame, and the mean lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that sounds right.

So first, I need to compute τ
