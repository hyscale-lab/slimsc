Okay, so I have this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. The parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of the distance in parsecs. So, parallax plx = 1/distance (d), right? So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and farther stars have smaller parallaxes.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution—wait, does that mean uniformly in all directions, like isotropic? Or uniformly in some other way? I think it refers to the density of stars being uniform in space. So, the number density of stars is the same throughout.

So, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Let's think about how many stars are in a certain range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx.

I need to relate this to the distance and volume. Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d. So, the distance d = 1/plx.

Now, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. If the density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume. So, I should think about the volume between two distances and how that relates to the parallax.

Let me consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell is 4π d² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)π r³, so the shell's volume is the difference between r and r+dr: (4/3)π (d+dr)^3 - (4/3)π d^3 ≈ 4π d² dr.

So, the number of stars in this shell is the volume times the density, which is a constant. Let's call the number density n. So, number of stars in the shell is N = n * 4π d² dr.

But we want to express this in terms of parallax, plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in.

So, d = 1/plx → dr = -d(plx)/ (plx^2) d(plx) ). Wait, maybe I should express dr in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/d → d plx = -1/d² dr. So, dr = - d² dplx. Hmm, but for the purpose of getting the relation, perhaps I can just express everything in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. But when integrating over plx, the negative sign would indicate the direction, but since we're considering small changes, perhaps the absolute value is more relevant.

So, substituting d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx.

So, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is expressed in terms of dplx, so dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but the number of stars is a positive quantity, so perhaps take the absolute value: |dr| = (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express N as a function of plx. Because the number of stars in a shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² dr. But when plx is small (large d), the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to d² dr.

But since we need it in terms of plx, let's substitute d =1/plx and dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases. So, as plx increases, d decreases. So, for a small change in plx, d changes by dr = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx. So the negative sign just means that as plx increases, d decreases.

But when we're considering the number of stars, we can ignore the negative sign because we're considering the magnitude. So, dr = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π d² dr = n *4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx )

Wait, wait, that would be (1/plx)^2 multiplied by (1/plx²) dplx, so (1/plx^4) dplx. So N = n * 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, number of stars per unit range of plx (so, dplx=1) is N = 4π n / plx^4. So, the number density as a function of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the math. Because if I have d =1/plx, then d squared is 1/pl
