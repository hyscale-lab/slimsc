Okay, I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it says. So, there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. The particles have negligible mass, which probably means I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or gravitational effects. 

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Oh, and the energy should be in Joules, correct to three decimal places. The options are given, so I can check against them once I work through it.

Wait, right. Electric potential energy in a system of charges. Since all the charges are the same, they'll repel each other. But since some are fixed, maybe I need to calculate the potential energy between each charge and all the others.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, so the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 is 2 meters away from P. But what about the potential energy between each other? Because the 12 charges are all located at 2 meters from P, but how are they arranged? Are they all at the same point? That can't be, because then they'd be on top of each other, which would be impossible due to their repulsion. So perhaps they are arranged in a way
