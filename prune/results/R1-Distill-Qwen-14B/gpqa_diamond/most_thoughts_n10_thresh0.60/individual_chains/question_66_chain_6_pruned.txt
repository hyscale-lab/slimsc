Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) with higher-dimensional operators. These operators are added to the SM Lagrangian to account for new physics beyond the SM, but at a higher energy scale which we can't access directly.

The question is about which symmetries must all operators in SMEFT respect. The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four.

Wait, so first, what do I know about these symmetries?

Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in relativity, ensuring that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in inertial frames. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, right? So SMEFT, being an effective theory built on the SM, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. Otherwise, the theory would not make sense because it would depend on the observer's frame, which is not acceptable in a Lorentz-symmetric universe.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz transformations plus translations (like shifting in space and time). So it's a larger symmetry group than Lorentz. The SM is Poincare-invariant. But wait, in SMEFT, when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they necessarily preserve Poincare symmetry?

I think that in SMEFT, the operators are organized according to their dimension. For example, dimension 6 operators are the leading terms. These operators are integrated into the SM Lagrangian, which already respects Poincare symmetry. Wait, but I'm not sure if these higher-dimension operators themselves automatically respect Poincare. Or do they have to?

Wait, no. The operators are constructed in such a way that when you write down the Lagrangian, it's Poincare-invariant. Because the SM is Poincare-invariant, and the SMEFT Lagrangian is just adding terms to that. So each operator must be Poincare-invariant. Because if an operator weren't, then the entire Lagrangian wouldn't be, which would break the symmetry. So I think both Lorentz and Poincare must be respected.

Wait, but wait, no. Wait. Poincare includes translations. The SMEFT operators are local, so their
