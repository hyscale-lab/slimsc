Okay, so I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So, I think Grubbs would cause the alkene to break and reform differently.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means five carbons with a double bond starting at the first carbon. So, CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, pent is five carbons. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The double bond is between 1 and 2. So, structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So, on the third carbon of the pentene, which is the third carbon from the double bond. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, wait, no, because pentene is five carbons. So, position 1 double bond, so carbons are 1,2,3,4,5. So, 1 and 2 are double bonded. Then, the substituents on carbon 3 (position 3) would be a methyl group. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂? No, maybe I should think of it as CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me get this right. Pentane is five carbons. So, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. So, 3-methyl would add a methyl group on the third carbon. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-
