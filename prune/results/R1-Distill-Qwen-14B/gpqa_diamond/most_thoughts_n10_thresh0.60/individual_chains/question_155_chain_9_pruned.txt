Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the matrix representations are given in that basis.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state.

First, let me get the state vector. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's denote this as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The operator P_z has a matrix form given. Let me write that down:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

Wait, so in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, the matrix is diagonal, I think. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so each basis state |n⟩ corresponds to a diagonal element in P_z's matrix.

Now, since the state is given in this basis, I can compute ⟨P_z⟩ by taking the expectation value of P_z in this state. That would be the sum of |a_i|² * (diagonal elements of P_z). Wait, because in the eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal, so the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities times the corresponding eigenvalues.

Let me compute that. The diagonal elements of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The state |ψ⟩ has components [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So the probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of each component.

Compute |a₁|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4
Compute |a₂|²: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2
Compute |a₃|²: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4)ħ - (1/4)ħ = 0. Oh, that's zero.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements.

So the diagonal elements of P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2. So that's ħ², 0, ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ would be (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4)ħ² = (1/2)ħ².

So now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, it's just sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩) = sqrt( (1/2)ħ² ) = (ħ) / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm the steps again.

The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. So when I compute ⟨P_z⟩, each component is multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. So each term is (component)^2 times eigenvalue of P_z.

The first component is -1/2, so (1/4
