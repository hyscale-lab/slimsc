Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, the denominator looks like 4 minus (x² + y²), right? So 4 is like r² where r is 2, because x² + y² = r². That makes sense because when r=2, the denominator would be (4 - r²) = 0. Oh wait, but if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, so the metric blows up. That usually indicates a singularity, maybe like the edge of a wormhole or something.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. In 2D, it's like a hyperbolic space. The metric given looks like it's in 2D because there are only two coordinates, x and y. So it's a 2-dimensional metric.

Wait, how do I compute the area of a surface using the metric? Oh right, the area element is the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. But wait, the metric here is given in terms of line element ds². So the metric tensor g has components. Let me write this out.

In 2D, the metric in terms of dx and dy would
