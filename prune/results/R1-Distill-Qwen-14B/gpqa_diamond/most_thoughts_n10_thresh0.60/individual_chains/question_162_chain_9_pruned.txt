Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think it through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I think this is a 2-dimensional metric, so it's describing some kind of surface. The question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape.

In general, when you have a metric, the area element can be found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Let me recall: the metric tensor here is diagonal, right? Because it's only in terms of dx² and dy², no cross terms. So the metric tensor components are g_xx and g_yy. Both are equal in this case because the coefficient is the same for dx² and dy². So g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²).

The determinant of a 2x2 diagonal matrix is just the product of the diagonal elements. So determinant g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. Then the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy. Since g is positive, sqrt(g) is just g. So dA = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but that's the area element for this metric. Now, we need to find the total area of the pseudosphere. So we have to integrate this over the entire surface.

But wait, what's the region over which we integrate? The denominator in the metric is (4 - x² - y²). For the metric to be real, the denominator must be positive. Otherwise, the metric would have imaginary components, which doesn't make sense physically. So 4 - x² - y² > 0 → x² + y² < 4. So the region is inside a circle of radius 2 (since 4 is 2 squared) in the x-y plane. That makes sense because the pseudosphere of radius r=2 would have a curvature related to that radius.

Wait, but the radius in a pseudosphere is different from the usual sphere. For a sphere, the area is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, so its area is different. Oh right, the area of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) is finite, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Wait no, wait. The area of a tractricoid, which is a pseudosphere, is 4π. Or wait, is that correct? I think the area depends on the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K for a pseudosphere is negative. The formula for the area of a surface with constant curvature is A = 2π r² (1 + (1/(|K|)) sinh²(sqrt(|K|) r / 2))). Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to think about integrating the area element over the allowed region.

So the area would be the double integral of (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy over x² + y² < 4
