Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question has two parts: Reaction A and Reaction B. I need to figure out the major products for each and then choose the correct option from A to D.

First, let's look at Reaction A:

The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. So, I'm thinking this is some kind of nucleophilic addition or maybe a Michael addition. Wait, no, wait. Wait, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. And ethyl acrylate is an electron-deficient enolate maybe? Or perhaps it's undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclic ketone: cyclohexanone with substituents. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that mentally. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. Wait, no, wait: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, position 1 is the ketone. Position
