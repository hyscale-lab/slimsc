Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, likely dehydrohalogenation. So, two molecules of HBr would be eliminated, forming an alkene. Since adamantane is a highly branched, diamondoid structure, the elimination would form an alkene within the adamantane framework.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh, wait no, maybe in the structure, 1 and 3 are adjacent. Wait, in adamantane, each carbon is connected to three others. So maybe 1 and 3 are in positions that would allow elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diepoxide or something else. Wait, no, KOH is a base. So it's an E2 elimination, probably forming an alkene.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so each bromine is on a different carbon, but perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves, but this would require two elimination steps. Wait no, elimination occurs when two adjacent Brs are present, leading to the formation of a double bond between the two carbons. But if the Brs are on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent, then perhaps it's not possible for them to eliminate directly. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh, wait, perhaps the structure is such that the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. Maybe I'm confusing the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and when KOH is present, it abstracts a β-hydrogen, and the Br leaves, forming a double bond between those two bridgehead carbons. So, the product would be 1,3-diene or something like that? Or maybe 1,2-diene, but wait, in adamantane, bridgeheads are connected by single bonds, so forming a double bond between them would create a diene.

Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. That makes me think of an ether, but no, KOH is a base, more likely an elimination product, so maybe an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation forming an alkene, but given that the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, maybe it's forming a diene elsewhere. Or perhaps it's a ring-opening, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the
