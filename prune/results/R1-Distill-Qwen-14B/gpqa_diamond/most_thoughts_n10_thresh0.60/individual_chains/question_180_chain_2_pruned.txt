Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to parse what's being asked.

The question: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, and choose the right option from A to D.

Wait, so the setup is that we have a point charge at P, and 12 others arranged in a sphere around it, each 2 meters away. Each charge is 2e. So, the system's potential energy depends on these charges' arrangement.

Hmm, I remember that the potential energy between point charges can be calculated using Coulomb's law. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But wait, in this case, we have multiple charges. Since all the charges are the same, maybe I can compute the potential energy contributed by each pair and then sum them all up.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2m away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge.

But I also
