Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. I need to find the minimum energy of the system.

Alright, let me read the question again carefully. There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times the elementary charge. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything else besides the electric potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So the setup is a bit like having a central charge with 12 others around it, each at 2 meters away.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Minimum energy? I remember that the potential energy in a system of charges can be minimized when the charges are arranged in a way that minimizes repulsion. Since all charges are positive (since each is 2e and e is positive), they repel each other. So to minimize potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves in a configuration that requires the least work, which for point charges is when they are as far apart as possible given the constraints.

Wait, but in this problem, twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from point P, which is where the 13th charge is fixed. So those 12 are all at 2m from P, but I guess their arrangement among themselves could affect the total potential energy. Oh wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement around P, so maybe it's just considering the potential between the fixed charge and the others, and the potential among the 12 others.

Wait, no. The problem says 12 are constrained at 2m from P. So each of those 12 is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary, but for minimum energy, what's the best arrangement? Oh, wait, potential energy between two charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1*q2)/r. And the total potential energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials.

So the system has two parts: the potential between the 13th charge (fixed at P) and each of the 12 charges, and the potential between each pair of the
