Okay, so I've got this question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly. But wait, how does that affect the number of stars per unit range of parallax?

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, or something like that.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit of parallax changes with plx. So if I imagine looking at a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + d, how many stars would be in that range.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, their number density is the same throughout. So the number of stars in a certain volume is proportional to the volume. But wait, parallax relates to distance, so I should think in terms of distance and volume.

Wait, parallax plx is 1/d, so distance d = 1/plx. But stars are spread uniformly in space, so the number per unit volume would be the same. So for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to r² dr.

But wait, dr is the change in distance, and we need to relate that to change in parallax. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) d plx.
