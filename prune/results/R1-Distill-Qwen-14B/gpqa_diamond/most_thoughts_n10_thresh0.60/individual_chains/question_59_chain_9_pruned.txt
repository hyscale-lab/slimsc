Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about determining the pH of a solution. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question says that we have three different solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So the first thing I should do is figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture. Because when H+ and OH- ions react, they form water. So any excess will determine the pH.

Let's break it down step by step. First, I'll calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with the acetic acid (CH3COOH). Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But for the purpose of calculating H+ ions, maybe I can treat it as a source of H+? Wait, no, maybe I should first see if it's in excess after considering the reaction with the base.

Wait, but I also have HCl, which is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ completely. And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate OH- ions.

So I think I should first calculate the total moles of H+ from all the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then see which one is in excess, and calculate the pH based on that.

Let me calculate each part:

1. Moles of CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 0.5 L. Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, each mole gives less than one mole of H+. But wait, maybe I should consider it after dealing with the strong acid and base reactions. Because if there's excess OH-, it will neutralize the H+ from the acids.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The problem involves mixing all three solutions, so the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200
