Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. Oh right, it's about the uncertainty principle. I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum, and I think it can also be applied to energy and time. Wait, but the question here is about energy uncertainty due to a spatial uncertainty. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of momentum uncertainty first.

The question says: An electron is moving along the x-direction at speed v = 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in its position is Δx = 0.1 nm. We need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The Uncertainty Principle is Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. So maybe I should calculate Δp first using that, and then use that to find the uncertainty in energy.

Let me list what I know. The uncertainty principle equation is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can take the equality Δx Δp = ħ/2. So Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

What's ħ? Oh right, it's the reduced Planck constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes approximated as 1e-34 for quick calculations. Let me go with 1e-34 for now.

Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometer is 1e-9 meters. So Δx = 0.1e-9 meters.

So plugging in the numbers: Δp = (1e-34 J·s) / (2 * 0.1e-9 m). Let me calculate that denominator first. 2*0.1e-9 is 2e-10 * 0.1? Wait no, 2 *0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9, which is 2e-10 m.

So Δp = (1e-34) / (2e-10) = (1e
