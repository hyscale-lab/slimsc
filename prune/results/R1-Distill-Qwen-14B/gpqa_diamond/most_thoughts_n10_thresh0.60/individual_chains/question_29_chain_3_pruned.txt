Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and found some changes in the first exon. The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, right, anti-nutritional compounds are usually produced by enzymes. So, if the gene is for an enzyme that makes this compound, a mutation in the gene might disrupt the enzyme's function, thus stopping the compound from being made.

Looking at the sequences, the wild-type and the mutants are provided. The wild-type sequence is given as:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, wait. Oh, wait, ATG is the start codon, so the gene starts there. The mRNA would be similar but in the complementary direction, but I think the question is about the DNA coding strand, so the mRNA would be the same as the given sequence except T becomes U.

The mutants are 1 through 4, and each has a change in the first exon area. So, I need to see which mutation would disrupt the gene product, perhaps by a frameshift or a premature stop codon.

Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the wild-type.

Wild-type first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

So, let's see the difference. Let's line them up.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…

Mut1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTAT TGT CGC…

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for where the letters differ.

Looking at each position:

Wild: positions 1-30 or so. Let me count the letters.

Wild-type:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TTT
7-9: CTC
10-12: GCT
13-15: GGT
16-18: ACT
19-21: TCT
22-24: GTG
25-27: GAT
28-30: GAA
31-33: CAT
34-36: ATT
37-39: TAT
40-42: TGT
43-45: CGT

Mutant 1:

Same until a point. Let's see where they differ.

Looking at Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, let's line them up.

Wild: positions 4-6 are TTT, Mutant 1: TCT. Wait, no, perhaps I should look for where the letters don't match.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to look for where the sequences differ. Let me write them out.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mut1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTAT TGT CGC...

Wait, so let's see each segment:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mut1: ATG TTT CTA CG
