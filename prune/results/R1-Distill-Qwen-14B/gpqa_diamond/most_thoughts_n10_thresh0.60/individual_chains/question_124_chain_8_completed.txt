Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to understand what it's asking. Hmm. So, particles are being collided in the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that decay quickly. These new particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. 

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But I think for this problem, maybe I don't need to get into that equation directly. 

The problem says that on average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. So, I need to find a new gamma that makes the fraction of particles reaching the walls increase from 1/3 to 2/3.

Hmm. So why does the fraction depend on the Lorentz factor? Oh, right, because the particles are moving relativistically. The time it takes for them to reach the detector walls is important. If they're moving faster (higher gamma), they might live longer, so more of them can reach the walls before decaying.

Wait, but wait. The particles are produced at the center and move outward. If a particle decays, it won't reach the wall. So the fraction that reaches the wall depends on the average lifetime of the particle and the time it takes to reach the wall.

I think the proper way to model this is using the concept of time dilation. The lifetime of the particle in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is gamma times the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame). 

So the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by its speed. But since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately c. So time t = R / (v), which is approximately R/(c) when v is near c. 

The distance is the radius of the detector, 30 meters. So t ≈ 30 / (3e8 m/s) → let me compute that. 30 divided by 3e8 is 1e-7 seconds, which is 0.1 microseconds. 

Now, the particles' lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by their proper lifetime (tau). So tau is the lifetime measured when the particle is at rest. So if the lifetime is gamma * tau, the particle will decay at a time t when t > gamma * tau. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is the probability that t < gamma * tau, which is the same as gamma * tau > t. Wait, no, wait. The particle must reach the wall before it decays, so the proper condition is that the lab lifetime (gamma tau) is greater than the time taken to reach the wall (t).

Wait, actually, the probability that the particle reaches the wall is the probability that the lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. So the probability P is the fraction of particles for which gamma tau > t.

But wait, what's tau? Tau is the proper lifetime. So for a given gamma, if gamma tau is greater than t, then the particle will reach the wall. So the probability P is the fraction of particles for which gamma tau > t, which is like P = probability that a particle's lifetime is longer than t. 

Wait, but no, I think the decay is a Poisson process. The probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - e^(-t/tau_lab), where tau_lab is gamma * tau. So the probability that it hasn't decayed before time t is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Wait, no, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think again. The decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - e^(-t/(gamma tau)). So the probability that it survives (doesn't decay) until time t is the same as e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

But in this case, the average survival probability is given as the fraction that reaches the detector walls. So when the Lorentz factor is gamma, the survival probability is e^(-t/(gamma tau)).

Given that, in the initial scenario, gamma is 20, and the fraction surviving is 1/3. So 1/3 = e^(- t/(20 tau)).

Now, when gamma is increased, we want the fraction surviving to be 2/3. So 2/3 = e^(- t/(gamma_new tau)).

We can relate the two equations. Let me write them down:

1/3 = e^(- t/(20 tau)) → take the natural log of both sides: ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau) → -ln(3) = -t/(20 tau) → ln(3) = t/(20 tau) → t = 20 tau ln(3).

Wait, no. Let me double-check. ln(1/3) is -ln(3). So:

ln(1/3) = - t/(20 tau) → -ln(3) = - t/(20 tau) → t/(20 tau) = ln(3) → t = 20 tau ln(3).

Wait, but in the second case, we have:

2/3 = e^(-t/(gamma_new tau)) → ln(2/3) = - t/(gamma_new tau) → -ln(3/2) = - t/(gamma_new tau) → t/(gamma_new tau) = ln(3/2) → t = gamma_new tau ln(3/2).

So now, I have t from both equations: from the first case, t = 20 tau ln(3), and from the second case, t = gamma_new tau ln(3/2).

Set them equal: 20 tau ln(3) = gamma_new tau ln(3/2).

The tau cancels out. So:

gamma_new = [20 ln(3)] / [ln(3/2)]

Compute this numerically.

Let me compute ln(3) and ln(3/2). 

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) ≈ ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So gamma_new ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ ?

Compute 20 * 1.0986 = 21.972.

21.972 / 0.4055 → let's see. 21.972 ÷ 0.4 is about 54.93. But 0.4055 is a bit more than 0.4, so the result is a bit less than 54.93.

Let me compute it more accurately.

0.4055 × 54 = 21.993. Oh, wait, 54 × 0.4055 = ?

54 * 0.4 is 21.6; 54 * 0.0055 is 0.297; so total 21.897. Hmm, which is less than 21.972.

So 54 gives 21.897. The difference is 21.972 -21.897 = 0.075.

How much more is needed? So 0.075 / 0.4055 ≈ 0.185. So the gamma_new is approximately 54 + 0.185 ≈ 54.185.

Wait, but wait, let me compute 21.972 / 0.4055 again.

Compute 0.4055 × 54 = let's compute manually:

0.4055 × 50 = 20.275

0.4055 ×4 = 1.622 → sum is 21.897.

We have 54 → 21.897. The target is 21.972, which is 0.075 higher.

So how much does 0.4055 go into 0.075? 0.075 / 0.4055 ≈ 0.185. So 54.185.

So gamma_new ≈54.185.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, C is 40, D is 28. So 54 is the closest. 

But wait, why? Because I thought the initial gamma was 20, and the fraction was 1/3. Now, we're increasing gamma so that the fraction increases to 2/3.

Wait, but how does increasing gamma affect the fraction? Let me think. Higher gamma means longer lifetime, so particles live longer, so more can reach the detector. So we want a higher gamma than 20 to get a higher fraction (from 1/3 to 2/3). So my calculation suggests gamma_new is around 54, which is higher than 20, which makes sense.

Looking at the options, option A is 54. So I think the correct answer is A) 54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P = e^{-t / (\gamma \tau)}
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for a particle to reach the detector walls, \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle in its rest frame.

### Step 1: Relating the given data
The detector has a radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \), and the particles travel at ultra-relativistic speeds (\( v \approx c \)). The time to reach the walls is:

\[
t = \frac{R}{v} \approx \frac{R}{c} = \frac{30}{3 \times 10^8} = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s}.
\]

For the initial case, the Lorentz factor is \( \gamma = 20 \), and the survival probability is \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). Using the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = e^{-t / (20 \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

Since \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3) \), we find:

\[
\ln(3) = \frac{t}{20 \tau}.
\]

Thus:

\[
t = 20 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### Step 2: Solving for the new Lorentz factor
For the second case, the survival probability is \( P = \frac{2}{3} \), and we want to find the new Lorentz factor \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \). Using the survival probability formula again:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = e^{-t / (\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau)}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}.
\]

Since \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \), we find:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{t}{\gamma_{\text{new}} \tau}.
\]

Thus:

\[
t = \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

### Step 3: Equating the two expressions for \( t \)
From the first case, \( t = 20 \tau \ln(3) \), and from the second case, \( t = \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \). Setting these equal:

\[
20 \tau \ln(3) = \gamma_{\text{new}} \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \tau \) and solving for \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \):

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Step 4: Numerical computation
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we compute:

\[
\gamma_{\text{new}} = \frac{20 \times 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx \frac{21.972}{0.4055} \approx 54.185.
\]

### Step 5: Final answer
The closest option to \( \gamma_{\text{new}} \approx 54.185 \) is \( 54 \). Therefore, the required Lorentz factor is:

**Answer: A**
