Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name for the given benzene ring structure. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the molecule has a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group. All of these are meta to each other. Wait, meta means they're each separated by one carbon, right? So they're positioned at the 1, 3, and 5 positions relative to each other? Or maybe I should think about it differently. Oh wait, in benzene rings, substituents that are meta to each other are two carbons apart.

But wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. That's a bit confusing because in a benzene ring, each substituent can only have one meta position. Oh wait, no. Let me think again. Benzene is a six-membered ring. If I have three substituents, each must be in a position that's meta to the others. Hmm, maybe they're arranged in a way that each is adjacent (like 1,3,5 positions). No, wait, 1,3,5 positions are all meta to each other because each is two carbons apart. Right, so the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring. But wait, the main functional group is the carboxylic acid, which has the highest priority. So
