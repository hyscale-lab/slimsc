Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, special relativity comes into play. But wait, I'm a bit rusty, so let me think through this step by step.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different values for v_rel and E.

First, I need to find the relative speed between them. I recall that in relativity, you can't just subtract their speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait a second. Both are moving in the same direction, so their velocities are in the same direction. So v1 is 0.6c and v2 is 0.5c. So let me plug these into the formula.

v_rel = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. Which is about 0.14c when rounded to two decimal places. So that's the relative speed. Looking at the options, choices C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that eliminates A and B.

Now, the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy, right? Or wait, total energy is the sum of each astronaut's total energy.

Each astronaut's total energy is given by gamma * m c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E_total = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c².

Looking at the options, when v_rel is 0.14c, option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches what I just got. Option D says E=5mc², which is less, so probably not. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. For gamma1: 0.6c, so (0.6)^2=0.36. 1-0.36=0.64. sqrt(0.64)=0.8. So 1/0.8=1.25. Yep, that's correct.

Gamma2: 0.5^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So 1/0.866≈1.1547. Correct.

So E1=2.5, E2≈3.464. Sum is about 5.964, which is approximately 5.96 mc² as in option C. So the answer must be C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using principles of special relativity.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches options C and D.

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (Mass \(2m\), Speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m c^2) = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Second Astronaut (Mass \(3m\), Speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m c^2) \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 \approx 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

This matches the total energy \(E \approx 5.96m c^2\) in option C.

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(E \approx 5.96m c^2\). Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
