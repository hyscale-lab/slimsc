Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about the 1H NMR spectrum of a di-substituted aromatic compound. Let me read the question again carefully.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. So, the ring is aromatic, which means it's probably benzene-based, but with substituents. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-Cl, C-Br, etc.). So, the substituents on the benzene ring probably include a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. If the ring is 6-membered and has 8 carbons in total, then the substituents must add two carbons. Because benzene itself has 6 carbons, so 6 + 2 = 8. So, the substituents contribute two carbons in total. So each substituent is likely a single carbon, or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent must be one carbon each, adding up to two. So substituents could be a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and a halogen attached directly to the ring. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group as part of a larger substituent. Hmm, wait. Let's think.

Wait, the substituents could be groups like -CO- something, but let me think about the carbonyl. The carbonyl could be a ketone, which is a single substituent (like -CO-R where R is another group). Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group like -COOH or -COOR.

But let's think about the structure. So the ring is benzene with two substituents. Let me think of the possibilities.

One substituent could be a carbonyl group, perhaps as an acyl group. Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or something like that. Also, the other substituent is a halogen on the aromatic ring.

Wait, but a halogen on the ring would be as a substituent like -Cl, -Br, etc. So that's one substituent. The other substituent is a carbonyl group. So perhaps the structure is
