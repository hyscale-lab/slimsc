Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question involves identifying a compound based on its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. 

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the question says it's a very broad peak. Carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch because they're usually deprotonating a bit, so that makes sense. Also, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, probably a carboxylic acid group because that fits with the broad O-H and the C=O peak.

Moving on to the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So, the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or at least no protons on double bonds. That rules out any possibility of alkenes or aromatic rings, which is good to know.

Looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me break it down. Splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. Each split is from coupling with adjacent Hs. So, the first signal being a doublet of triplets of quartets suggests that the proton is next to groups that have 1, 2, and 3 neighboring protons. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the splitting patterns.

Wait, another approach: the splitting of a proton depends on the number of neighboring (vicinal) protons. For example, if a proton has two neighboring groups with n and m protons, each will cause splitting. Like, a triplet of triplets would mean coupling with two groups, one with 2 protons and another with 2. But in this case, the splitting is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of multiple coupling partners. Let's think about each signal.

First signal: doublet of triplets of quartets. That implies that the proton is split by three different sets of neighboring Hs. For example, if a proton is next to a CH2 (2 H), a CH (1 H), and another CH2 (2 H), that could cause this pattern. Wait, but quartet is four peaks, which would come from coupling with a group of 3 H. Hmm, maybe I should think about each splitting step.

A quartet (four peaks) is usually from coupling with a group of 3 H. A triplet (three peaks) comes from coupling with 2 H. A doublet (two peaks) from 1 H. So, the first signal is a doublet (coupled with 1 H), then a triplet (coupled with 2 H), then
