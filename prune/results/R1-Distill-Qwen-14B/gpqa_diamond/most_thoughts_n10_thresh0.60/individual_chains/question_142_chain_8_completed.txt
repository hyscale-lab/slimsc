Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The question is asking about the position of a specific density matrix, rho, in the qubits space.

The given density matrix is rho = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, let me write that out to visualize it better. So, |0> and |1> are the standard basis states for a qubit. The density matrix is a sum of projectors onto these states, each multiplied by 1/2. So rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2.

I think I remember that the density matrix for a pure state |psi><psi| has a trace of 1 and is idempotent (rho squared equals rho). But when you have a mixed state, like this one, it's a statistical mixture. So for a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute it explicitly.

Calculating rho: |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is diagonal with 1 at (1,1). Adding them gives a 2x2 identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2 gives rho = [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. So the matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements 0.5.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices map to geometrical positions. Oh right! For a single qubit, the density matrices form a 3-dimensional space, and they can be represented as points on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states.

Wait, the Bloch sphere represents pure states as points on the surface, and mixed states as points inside. So the density matrix rho in this case is a mixed state because it's a convex combination of |0> and |1>, each with probability 1/2.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The density matrix can be expressed as rho = (I + r·sigma)/2, where I is the identity matrix, sigma are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x, y, z). The length of r must be less than or equal to 1 for valid quantum states.

So let's break down rho = (I + r_x sigma_x + r_y sigma_y + r_z sigma_z)/2. Comparing this with the given rho, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute that.

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so (I)/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0,0.5]], which is exactly what rho is. That implies that the terms involving the Pauli matrices must be zero. Because if I add any Pauli terms, their off-diagonal elements would contribute. So, for example, sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so (sigma_x)/2 would add terms to the off-diagonal. But our rho has zero off-diagonal elements, so the coefficients r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would place the state at the origin, which makes sense because it's a maximally mixed state. Wait, the maximally mixed state is indeed the completely depolarized state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So that's the correct answer.

Wait another thought: the density matrix rho is diagonal, which suggests that it's along the z-axis. But in the Bloch sphere, the diagonal terms relate to the z-component. Wait, no, because rho = (I + r·sigma)/2. The diagonal elements of rho come from the diagonal terms of sigma matrices. But sigma_x and sigma_y are off-diagonal, so their contributions are to the off-diagonal elements of rho. The sigma_z matrix is diagonal with entries [1, -1], so when multiplied by r_z and added to I, the diagonal terms become (1 + r_z)/2 and (1 - r_z)/2.

Wait, let's compute rho again. Our rho is (I + r_z sigma_z)/2 because r_x and r_y are zero. So:

rho = [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , 0 ], [0, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

But our rho is [ [0.5, 0], [0, 0.5] ]. So each diagonal element is 0.5. So setting (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 and (1 - r_z)/2 = 0.5. Wait, solving for r_z in the first equation: (1 + r_z)/2 = 0.5 → 1 + r_z =1 → r_z=0. Similarly for the second equation: (1 - r_z)/2 =0.5 → 1 - r_z =1 → r_z=0. So yes, r_z is zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), so option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten explicitly as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & 0 \\ 0 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal diagonal elements, indicating it represents a maximally mixed state. For a single qubit, density matrices can be represented in terms of the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices. Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), it is evident that the off-diagonal terms involving \( \sigma_x \) and \( \sigma_y \) must vanish, implying \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). Additionally, the diagonal terms are equal, which implies \( r_z = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the origin in qubit space.

This is consistent with the fact that the given density matrix represents a maximally mixed state, which lies at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) \( r = (1,1,0) \): Incorrect, as the state is not on the surface of the Bloch sphere.**  
**B) \( r = (0,0,1) \): Incorrect, as the state is not aligned with the \( z \)-axis.**  
**C) \( r = (0,0,0) \): Correct, as the state is the maximally mixed state at the origin.**  
**D) \( r = (1,1,1) \): Incorrect, as the state is not on the surface of the Bloch sphere.**

Answer: C
