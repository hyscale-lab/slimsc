Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

The question is asking about the geometrical position of a given density matrix ρ in the qubits space. The options are points in 3D space, like r=(1,1,0) and so on.

The density matrix provided is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix for a qubit is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write that out.

So |0> is [1; 0], and |1> is [0; 1]. So |0><0| would be a matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiply by 1/2, so ρ becomes (1/2) * I = [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. Here, ρ is a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability.

I think the representation of a qubit state in geometry is often done using the Bloch sphere. Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states, where a pure state is a point on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

To find the position on the Bloch sphere, I remember that any single-qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz). So ρ = (I + r·σ)/2.

Let me compute that. Given ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|)= I/2. So:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 → Multiply both sides by 2: I = I + r·σ → Subtract I: 0 = r·σ → So r·σ must be zero matrix.

Wait, that implies r is the zero vector because the only way r·σ = 0 is if r is (0,0,0). Because σ matrices are [σx, σy, σz], which are non-zero except for the diagonal maybe. So if rx σx + ry σy + rz σz equals zero matrix, each component must be zero. So each coefficient must be zero.

So that would mean r = (0,0,0). Which is the origin in 3D space. So the geometrical position is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but wait. What about mixed states? The Bloch sphere representation is for pure states, right? So how is this case handled? Oh, right, mixed states can be represented as points inside the Bloch sphere. But how is their position determined?

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a completely mixed state (like this one, which is maximally mixed), it's represented at the center of the sphere. Because the completely mixed state has zero purity, so it's as far as possible from the surface, which is the origin in this case.

So yeah, ρ being (I/2) is the completely mixed state, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere, which is (0,0,0). So the correct option is C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To analyze its geometrical position, we use the Bloch sphere representation, where any single-qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \( \vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is a vector in 3D space. For the given density matrix, we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

This implies that \( \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma} = 0 \), which means \( \vec{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). The vector \( \vec{r} \) corresponds to the position of the state in the Bloch sphere. Since \( \rho \) is a maximally mixed state, it is represented at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the point \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
