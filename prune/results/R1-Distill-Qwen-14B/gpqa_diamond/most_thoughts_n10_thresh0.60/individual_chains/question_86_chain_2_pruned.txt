Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it carefully again.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products from both reactions are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. Wait, no, actually, looking closer, it's the same product but with different configurations. So, the first reaction with LiBH4 gives (R) configuration, and the second with BH3 gives (S) configuration. Or is the product the same but the starting materials differ in their configuration?

Wait, the question says the chemist treated two unknown compounds (A and B) with two different reducing agents, LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, and got these products. So, A and B are different starting materials, and they're being reduced to the same ketone but with opposite configurations.

Hmm, so I need to figure out what the starting materials A and B are, based on the reagents used and the configurations of the products.

First, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3, on the other hand, is typically used for hydroboration reactions. Oh wait, but wait, in some cases, BH3 can be used for reductions as well, but perhaps under different conditions.

Wait, the products are ketones. Wait, no, the product is a tetrahydro
