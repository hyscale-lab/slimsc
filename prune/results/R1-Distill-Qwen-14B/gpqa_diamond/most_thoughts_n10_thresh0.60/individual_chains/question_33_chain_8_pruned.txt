Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, I remember that cycloadditions are pericyclic reactions, and [4+2] is a Diels-Alder reaction. Oh wait, but sometimes they can also involve other components. Let me think.

The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is under heat. So, the question is about identifying the exo product. Exo vs endo? Right, the endo rule says that the more substituted product is favored, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, but wait, the problem is about the exo product, so maybe I should think about the transition state. Oh right, in Diels-Alder, the endo transition state is more favorable because of possible secondary orbital interactions. But sometimes, maybe the exo product is formed if the reaction conditions favor it, like high temperature or certain substituents.

So, the starting materials: 2,5-dimethylthiophene. Thiophene is an aromatic heterocycle with sulfur. The substituents are at 2 and 5 positions, which are adjacent to the sulfur. Furan-2,5-dione is another dienophile, right? Furan has two ketone groups at 2 and 5 positions, making it a good dienophile because the electron-withdrawing groups activate the double bonds.

Wait, wait, Diels-Alder requires a
