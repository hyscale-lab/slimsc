Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, the problem is about mixing acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so I need to figure out if there's excess acid or base after the reaction.

Let me start by writing down the information given. The three solutions are:

1. 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid)
2. 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid)
3. 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2 (a strong base)

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L).

So for each solution:

Acetic acid: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles
HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles
Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? Each formula unit of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 OH- ions. So the moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, let's think about what's happening when these solutions are mixed. The acids (CH3COOH and HCl) will react with the base (Ba(OH)2). Since HCl is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely. But when reacting with a base, I think only the strong acid's H+ would react first, maybe?

Wait, no. Acids will donate H+ and bases will accept H+. So the H+ from both acids (HCl and CH3COOH) will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely ionize, meaning all of its H+ is available. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so only a small fraction of
