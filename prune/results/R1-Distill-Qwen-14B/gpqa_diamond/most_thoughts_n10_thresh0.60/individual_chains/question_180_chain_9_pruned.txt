Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, right. So energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electric potential energy. Since all the charges are fixed, except the 13th, which is fixed at point P, I think the potential energy would be the sum of the interactions between each pair of charges.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. So the distance between each of these 12 and the 13th charge is 2m.

But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same point, or are they arranged in a particular way? The problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. I think that means they're each located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P. But their exact arrangement on the sphere isn't specified. Wait, but since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the arrangement affects the potential energy.

Wait, no. Let me think. The potential energy between two charges is given by U = (k * q1 * q2) / r. But when summing for all pairs, how does the arrangement of the 12 charges affect the total potential energy? Because if the charges are spread out, each pair among the 12 might have different distances between them. But wait, to minimize the potential energy, what's the best arrangement?

Wait, no, wait a second. The problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So each is at a distance 2m from P, but their mutual distances can vary. But for the potential energy, the mutual interactions between the 12 charges would contribute to the total. But calculating each pair's contribution would be complicated because their positions relative to each other aren't given. However, the question asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the arrangement that minimizes the potential energy is when the mutual repulsion is minimized. But wait, all charges are positive because each is 2e. So they repel each other.

Wait, wait. If all charges are positive, then the potential energy between any two of them is positive. Because U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(r) = positive. So the total potential energy will be the sum of all these positive terms.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, so each of the 12 charges will have potential energy with respect to it. And each of those is a fixed distance of 2m. So the energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 others is straightforward.

But the problem is also asking about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Because each of those 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the others. But without knowing the exact positions, how can we calculate this?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem is an isolated system, so maybe the minimum energy refers to the potential energy due to the 13th charge and the 12 others, not considering the mutual interactions between the 12. Because if the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, maybe their mutual distances are not relevant? Or perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as part of the setup.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Because the system's total potential energy must include all interactions between every pair of charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point? No, because if they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, they can't all be at the same point unless that point is 2m from P. So they can be arranged in any way as long as each is 2m from P. So the mutual distances between the 12 can vary. But the problem is looking for the minimum energy. So perhaps arranging the 12 charges as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy. Wait, but all are positive, so their repulsion would lead to higher potential energy when they are closer. Wait, no: the potential energy increases as the charges get closer because the potential energy between two positive charges is positive and increases as r decreases. So to minimize the total potential energy, the 12 charges should be arranged as far apart as possible, given the constraints.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy between the 12 charges is considered as a fixed value, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the system's potential energy is only due to the
