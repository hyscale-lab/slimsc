Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about an isolated system of identical particles with charge and stuff. Alright, let me read it again.

The problem states: There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Wait, so the setup is that 12 charges are all at 2 meters from point P, and the 13th is fixed there. So, the 13th charge is at the center, and the others are arranged around it? I think so.

The question is about the minimum energy. I remember that in systems of point charges, the potential energy can be calculated based on their positions. But wait, since the system is isolated, I think we're dealing with electrostatic potential energy.

Each charge is 2e. So each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge here is 3.2e-19 C.

I think the formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges is given by the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. So, U = (1/(4πε₀)) * sum over all pairs (q_i * q_j / r_ij).

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 m from P. So, the 13th charge is at the center, and the 12 are arranged in a sphere of radius 2 m around it.

So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same distance from each other?

Well, if all 12 are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m and the 13th is at the center, then each of the 12 charges is 2 m away from the 13th. But what's the distance between any two of the 12 charges?

Hmm, well, the distance between two points on a sphere of radius r depends on the angle between them. The maximum distance is 2r (diametrically opposite), but the minimum is when they're closest, but in this case, the arrangement isn't specified. Since the problem is asking for the minimum energy, I think the charges would arrange themselves as close as possible to minimize the potential energy. Wait, but for like charges, bringing them closer would increase the potential energy, right? Because the potential energy of point charges is positive when they're repelling each other. So maybe arranging the charges as far apart as possible would actually minimize the potential energy. Or wait, perhaps it's the opposite because the system's potential energy is the sum of all pairwise energies, which for like charges are positive, so to minimize, you want to minimize each term.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy between two like charges is
