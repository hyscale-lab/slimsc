Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction is a type of conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the nucleophile is typically a enolate ion.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them with the given options.

Let me start with part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. 

Wait, what's dimethyl malonate? Oh right, it's (CH3CO)2CH2O-. So it's a good nucleophile, providing the enolate. The other compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 where the CH2 is attached to the p-tolyl group. Wait, no, wait. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl group on carbon 3. So it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3.

In the Michael reaction, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the nucleophile would attack the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl in the acrylate. 

Wait, so the acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. The enolate would attack the middle carbon (the one next to the double bond) of this acrylate. So the attack would occur at the CH2 part, adding the malonate's enolate there.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO2CH3)2CH-. When it acts as the nucleophile, it would contribute the enolate's carbanion. So when the enolate attacks the beta position of the acry
