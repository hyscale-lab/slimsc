Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, the question describes three different Michael addition reactions and asks about their products. Then, it gives four options, each with three product possibilities labeled A, B, and C. My goal is to figure out which option (A, B, C, or D) correctly lists the products.

Let me break down each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled A.

I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is typically an enolate. In this case, dimethyl malonate can form an enolate because it's a good Michael donor. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated ester.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. Its enolate would have negative charge on the central carbon. When it attacks the acrylate, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)CO2Me. The E configuration means the substituents are opposite each other.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (the nucleophile) would attack the beta carbon of the acrylate. Let me visualize this. The acrylate has the structure: 

CO2Me
|
CH2-C-(E)-C6H4-p-tolyl

Wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, 3-position would be the substituent. Wait, no, wait. The acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCO2R. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon? Wait, no, because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the substituent (p-tolyl) would be on the middle carbon (the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the acrylate group). Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)CO2Me. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is at carbon 2. So in the E configuration, the p-tolyl group is on the opposite side of the double bond compared to the CO2Me group.

When the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks, it would add to the beta carbon of the acrylate. The enolate would be at the central position of the malonate, so it's a
