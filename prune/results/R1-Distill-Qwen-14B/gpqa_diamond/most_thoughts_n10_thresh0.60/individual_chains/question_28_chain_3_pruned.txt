Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. I remember that this is a cyclohexenone derivative with a hydroxyl group at position 4. The configuration is S, which I think is important for stereochemistry in the reactions.

The first step is treating this with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBS-Cl) and triethylamine. I remember that TBS-Cl is a silylating agent, which typically protects hydroxyl groups. Since the starting material has a hydroxyl group at C4, this should form a TBS ether. Triethylamine is a base, so it probably deprotonates any acidic protons and helps with the nucleophilic attack. So, product 1 should be the TBS-protected version of the starting material. The structure would be 4-TBSO-cyclohex-2-en-1-one.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is used in conjugate additions. The cyclohexenone has a conjugated enone system. The Gilman reagent adds to the alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. So, the reagent would add a benzyl group to the beta position.

Wait, the cyclohexenone is 2-en-1-one, so the carbonyl is at C1, and the double bond is between C2 and C3. The Gilman reagent (Ph2CuLi) would add across the double bond. I think the addition is a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) because the enone is in position 2 and 3.

So, adding the benzyl group from the Gilman reagent would occur at C3. Let me visualize: after the addition, the cyclohexane would have a benzyl group at C3 and the carbonyl at C1. Also, the TBS group remains at C4 as an ether.

Wait, but the reagent is Ph2CuLi. When it reacts with the enone, the cuprate would add to the alpha position (beta to the carbonyl). Oh wait, no, in a conjugate addition, the Grignard or organocuprate adds to the beta carbon. So, the cuprate adds to C3, then the Li would abstract a proton, perhaps from the adjacent position.

But wait, the starting material after TBS protection is 4-TBSO-cyclohex-2-en-1-one. The enone is between C2 and C3. So, the cuprate would add a benzyl group to C3, and then the adjacent position (C2) would lose a proton, maybe. Alternatively, the addition could be to C3, pushing the double bond into a different position.

Wait, after the addition, the ring would have a new substituent.
