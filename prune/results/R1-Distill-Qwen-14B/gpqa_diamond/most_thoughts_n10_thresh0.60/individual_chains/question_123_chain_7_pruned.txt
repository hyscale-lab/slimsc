Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in relativity, I need to consider how distances and times transform between them.

Wait, the problem says that the ejecta and the galaxy are both inertial frames. Right, so they're moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. The ejecta sees the galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, wait. Oh, right, it's about time dilation and length contraction, I think. Because in special relativity, moving clocks run slower and moving objects are length contracted.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If an event happens in one frame, how does it look in the other? So, in the ejecta's frame, t' = 50 seconds. I need to find the distance in the galaxy's frame.

Wait, but how does the time in one frame relate to the other? Oh, because of the time dilation. So, the galaxy's frame would see less time passing if the ejecta is moving at a high velocity.

Wait, no, the gamma factor comes into play here. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But wait, what's v here? The speed of 60,000 km/s. Let me compute the gamma factor.

Wait, 60,000 km/s is
