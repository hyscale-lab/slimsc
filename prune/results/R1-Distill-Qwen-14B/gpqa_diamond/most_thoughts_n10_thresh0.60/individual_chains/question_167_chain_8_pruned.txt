Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy method. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they're more complex than Gaussian states, which are easier to handle. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through this step by step.

The state given is |psi> = [ cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. I know that |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is its complex conjugate. Coherent states are Gaussian states, right? So when you take a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, you get a non-Gaussian state, which is what a Schrödinger cat state is. So this state is definitely non-Gaussian.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Wait, how did they get that? Oh right, the normalization comes from taking the inner product of the state with itself. So |psi><psi| would involve |alpha> and |-alpha>, so their overlap would involve the exponential of alpha squared terms. But I don't think I need to worry about N here because it's already provided.

The non-Gaussianity is measured using the relative entropy, del_b, which is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Oh wait, relative entropy usually measures the difference between two distributions. But here, it's the difference between the state's entropy and a reference Gaussian state's entropy. So the idea is that if the state is Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity would be zero because both terms would be the same. But if it's non-Gaussian, the del_b would be positive.

Wait, actually, relative entropy is typically defined as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau), right? But here, the question defines del_b as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. That's a bit different. Hmm. So the usual relative entropy is for comparing two states, rho and tau, which is rho compared to tau. But here, it's subtracting the entropy of tau from the entropy of rho. So not sure about the exact interpretation, but maybe it's just a way to quantify how different rho is from a Gaussian.

But maybe I can proceed without getting bog
