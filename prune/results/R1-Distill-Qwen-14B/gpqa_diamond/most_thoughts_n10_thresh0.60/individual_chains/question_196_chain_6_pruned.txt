Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. Oh wait, and the speed of light is c. The options are A to D, so I need to pick the correct formula.

Wait, so in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator would be v_max = sqrt(kA/m), right? Because in simple harmonic motion, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², which gives v_max as sqrt(kA²/m).

But wait, this is a relativistic case. So I guess special relativity comes into play here. Oh right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant. So the equations of motion would change.

In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential is still V(x) = (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy in the system should be the sum of the rest mass energy and
