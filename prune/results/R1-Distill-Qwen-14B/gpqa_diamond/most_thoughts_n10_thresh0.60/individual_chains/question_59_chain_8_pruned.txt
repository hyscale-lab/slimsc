Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is asking me to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂.

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out if there's an excess of acid or base after mixing. Then, based on that excess, calculate the pH.

Let me break it down step by step. 

First, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base involved.

CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 moles of OH⁻.

Wait, so let's find the moles for each component.

For CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M, 400 mL = 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)₂: 0.3 M, 300 mL = 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But each mole of Ba(OH)₂ gives 2 OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, HCl and Ba(OH)₂ will react. HCl is an acid, so it will donate H+ ions. Ba(OH)₂ gives OH⁻. The reaction between H+ and OH⁻ produces water.

But wait, how do the moles compare? Let's see. The total H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ is
