Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the given spectroscopic information.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. There's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. I remember that the broad peak around 3000 is usually indicative of O-H stretching, like in carboxylic acids. Because carboxylic acids have that broad, strong O-H stretch. The peak at 1700 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). Since the compound is a carboxylic acid, that makes sense because the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm^-1.

So, the compound has a carboxylic acid group. That narrows it down to the four given options, all of which have a COOH group at the end.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds or aromatic rings with hydrogens attached. So, all the structures are probably aliphatic, which they seem to be.

One of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break that down. A quartet means each peak is split into four by neighboring Hs. A triplet would split each of those into three, and a doublet would split each into two. So, the splitting is happening in a stepwise manner: first a quartet, then each of those peaks is split into triplets, and then each of those is a doublet. Wait, actually, the order might matter. Or perhaps it's a multiplet that's described as a doublet of triplets of quartets. Alternatively, maybe it's a splitting pattern that arises from coupling with multiple sets of protons.

Wait, maybe I should think about the splitting in terms of neighboring groups. For a proton that has two neighboring groups, each with a different number of hydrogens, you'd get a splitting into (n+1)(m+1)... etc. So, for example, a proton next to two different sets of Hs: one with two Hs (a triplet) and another with three Hs (a quartet). But wait, a quartet would be when a proton is next to a group with three Hs. But wait, the splitting in NMR is determined by the number of neighboring non-equivalent protons.

But perhaps I should think about each of the options and their structures to see which would result in such splitting patterns.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

Structure: The molecule has two C(H)(C2H5) groups attached to a central carbon, then a CH2 group connected to COOH. So, the central carbon is attached to two C2H5 groups and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, let me write it properly.

Wait, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the structure is something like two CH2CH3 groups attached to a central carbon (the second C), and the same for the third C. Then connected to a CH2 group and COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw the structure as:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, the two middle carbons each have a CH group attached to two ethyl groups. So each of those middle CH groups is connected to two ethyl groups and the central CH2CH2COOH part.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

Structure: CH2CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the two middle carbons each have a H and two ethyl groups attached. So, the first group is a CH2CH3, then a C(H)(C2H5), etc.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So, the two middle carbons each have a H and a methyl group attached, and the other substituents are CH3.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Structure: CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the first group is ethyl, then two CH groups each with a methyl.

So, the question is about the NMR signals. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Wait, but perhaps the key is to look for equivalent protons and how they split each other.

In all the options, the presence of a COOH group means that the proton on the carbon next to COOH (the alpha carbon) is probably deshielded and might show a triplet or some splitting due to neighboring groups. But let's think about the other groups.

Looking for the NMR signals that could lead to such splitting patterns. Let's take each option and see.

Starting with option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

So the structure is:

CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

The central CH's are each attached to a CH3 and another groups. So, the two middle CH groups are each attached to a CH2CH3 (from the first carbon) and a CH3, and perhaps the next CH2COOH.

Wait, perhaps the protons on the central CH groups are each attached to two other groups. Let me see, each CH is connected to a CH2CH3 group (on one side) and a CH3 group (on the other), and the central CH is connected to the next carbon which is CH2COOH.

Alternatively, perhaps the central CH groups are each attached to two different substituents. So, each H on the central CH would be split by the neighboring Hs.

Wait, maybe I should consider the environment of each proton. For example, in option D, the H on the CH2CH3 group is a -CH2CH2- group attached to the first C. The first C is connected to the second C (which is a CH group), so the Hs on the CH2CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH.

Wait, but perhaps the key is to look for the coupling between the different groups. For instance, the CH2 group next to the COOH (CH2COOH) would have protons that are split by adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR signals are from the CH groups in the middle. Let me think about their splitting.

In option D, the two CH groups are each next to each other. So, each H on a CH is adjacent to the Hs on the neighboring CH. So, if each CH has one H, then the two Hs on adjacent CHs would couple, leading to splitting.

Wait, but each of these CHs is also attached to a CH2CH3 group and a CH3 group, perhaps leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the central CH's are each attached to two different substituents, leading to coupling with different numbers of protons.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is symmetrical, which would affect the NMR signals.

Wait, let's take each option and see what their NMR might look like.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So, two CH groups each attached to a C2H5 and a CH3. Wait, no: each CH is attached to a C2H5 and another CH group. Let me see: the first CH is attached to a CH3 (from the first group), a C2H5 (from the second substituent), and the next carbon. Hmm, perhaps the two CH groups are each attached to two ethyl groups.

Wait, no. The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the central two carbons are CH groups, each attached to a C2H5 group. So, each CH has a H, and two substituents: a C2H5 and another group.

Wait, the first CH is connected to a CH3 (from the CH3 group), a C2H5, and the next carbon (which is another CH with a C2H5). So, each H on the CH groups would have neighboring Hs on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups would couple with each other, leading to a double doublet or more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on each CH group are seeing two different sets of neighboring Hs. For example, each H is next to a CH2 group and another CH group.

Hmm, this is a bit complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for specific splitting patterns.

The problem says that one of the NMR signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Wait, no: let me re-read that. "One of the signals in the 1H NMR is a doublet of triplets of quartets whilst a different signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets."

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let's think about what that implies. A quartet arises from coupling with three neighboring Hs. A triplet arises from coupling with two. A doublet arises from coupling with one.

So, a quartet would split into four peaks. Then, when each of those is split into triplets, each quartet would split into (4 x 3) =12 peaks. Then, each of those 12 would be split into a doublet, making 24 peaks. That's a very complex multiplet, but perhaps for the purposes of this problem, it's not necessary to go into such detail.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting arises from coupling with two different sets of protons. For example, a proton that is adjacent to two different groups, each with a different number of Hs.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a CH group that is adjacent to another CH group, which in turn is adjacent to a CH2 group. So, the H on a CH group would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, and with the Hs on the CH2 group.

Wait, maybe let's take a specific example. Let's consider option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

The structure would be:

CH2CH3 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - COOH.

So, the first CH2CH3 group is attached to a CH that has a CH3 group and another CH group. Each CH has a H and is connected to a CH3 on one side and the next CH on the other side.

So, the Hs on the CH groups are each adjacent to a CH3, a CH2CH3, and another CH group. Wait, but perhaps each H on the CH groups is next to another H on the adjacent CH group. So, each H would couple with the H on the adjacent CH, leading to a doublet. But then, if each CH is also adjacent to a CH2 group, which has two Hs, that would add another splitting.

Wait, perhaps the H on a CH group is split by two different sets of Hs: the H on the adjacent CH group (coupling constant J1) and the two Hs on a neighboring CH2 group (coupling constant J2). So, first, the H would be a doublet from the adjacent CH H, then each of those peaks would split into a triplet due to the CH2 Hs, and perhaps each of those would split again into a quartet due to another set of Hs. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH group is split by the Hs on the adjacent CH group (which is one H), and by the Hs on a neighboring CH2 group (two Hs). So, first, the H would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH), then each of those would be split into a triplet (from the CH2 Hs), resulting in a doublet of triplets. Then, if there's another splitting, perhaps from another adjacent group, it would become a doublet of triplets of quartets or something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, some structures have more substituents. For example, in option D, the CH2 group is after the two CH groups. So, the CH2 would have two Hs, each of which would couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group in option D is between the two CH groups and the COOH. So, the structure is:

CH2CH3 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - COOH.

So, the Hs on the CH2 group (the one before COOH) are each adjacent to two Hs on the CH groups. Wait, no, because the CH groups each have a single H.

Wait, the CH2 group is attached to a C(H)(CH3) group on one side and a COOH on the other via a CH2. So, the Hs on the CH2 would be next to the two CH groups. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs: one from each CH group, but wait, each CH has only one H. So, if the CH2 is between the two CH groups, each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs (one on each side). But wait, each CH has only one H, so each H on the CH2 would be next to two Hs from two different CH groups. Hmm, that's possible.

Wait, the Hs on the CH2 would be next to each of the CH groups. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH groups. Each CH group has one H. So, each H on the CH2 would be split by two Hs (one from each adjacent CH). So, each H on CH2 would be a triplet from each CH group. But since there are two adjacent CH groups, each with one H, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, perhaps each H on the CH2 is split by the two Hs on the adjacent CH groups. So, each H on CH2 would first be a doublet from each CH's H. But since there are two CH groups, each with one H, the overall splitting would be a triplet for each H on the CH2. Because for each H on CH2, the neighboring groups are two CH groups, each with one H. The splitting would be like (n+1)(m+1) where n and m are the number of Hs on each adjacent group. So, (1+1)(1+1) = 4, so a quartet. Hmm, that's possible.

Wait, but wait. If each H on the CH2 is next to two Hs (one from each CH group), that would be two sets of coupling. So, each H on the CH2 would be a doublet of doublets. Or perhaps a triplet if the couplings are similar. But I'm not sure. Anyway, perhaps the CH2 group would show a triplet or a quartet.

But going back to the NMR data given, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that seems complicated, perhaps indicating a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring Hs with different coupling constants.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a CH2 group adjacent to two CH groups, each with a single H, would cause the CH2 Hs to be split into a triplet. Because each H on the CH2 is next to two Hs (one from each CH group), so (2) + 1 = triplet.

But in the data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps that's a more complex splitting from another part of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are the ones causing the complex splitting. Let's think about option D again.

Each CH group in option D is attached to a CH3, a CH2CH3, and another CH group. So, each H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the adjacent CH group and perhaps to the Hs on the CH2CH3 group.

Wait, the CH2CH3 group is attached to the first CH. The Hs on the CH2CH3 would be adjacent to the H on the CH group. So, perhaps the H on the CH group is split by the two Hs on the CH2CH3's adjacent carbon. So, each H on the CH would be a triplet due to the two Hs on the CH2CH3.

But wait, each CH has one H, and the CH2CH3 has two Hs. So, each H on the CH would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2CH3, leading to a triplet. But also, each H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group, leading to a doublet. So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, that would give a doublet of triplets. But in the data, one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps there's another coupling further away.

Alternatively, maybe each H on the CH is coupled with the H on the adjacent CH (doublet), the two Hs on the CH2CH3 (triplet), and the two Hs on the CH2 group after the two CH groups. That would add another level of splitting, making it a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So, the H on the CH group is seeing three different sets of neighboring Hs:

1. The H on the adjacent CH group (doublet).
2. The two Hs on the CH2CH3 group (triplet).
3. The two Hs on the CH2 group next to the COOH (quartet? Or perhaps another triplet).

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach is to look for which option would result in the most splitting, given the substituents.

Looking at the options again, the structures have varying substituents. Let me think about each option's possible NMR signals.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

In this structure, each CH group is attached to a C2H5 group. So, the two CH groups are each next to a C2H5 and a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are adjacent to the CH2 group (with two Hs) and the other CH group (with one H). So, each H on the CH would be a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the adjacent CH), leading to a triplet of doublets, which would be a doublet of triplets. But if there's another coupling, such as with the ethyl groups, perhaps it would add another level.

Alternatively, the CH2 group would have Hs that are adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H, making each H on the CH2 a quartet (since (1+1)*(1+1) = 4). But that's getting a bit complicated.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Here, each CH group is attached to a CH3 group. So, each H on the CH would be adjacent to another CH group (with one H) and perhaps the CH2 group (with two Hs). So, each H on the CH would be a triplet (from the CH2) and a doublet (from the adjacent CH). So, a doublet of triplets.

Similarly, the CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would be a quartet, as (1+1)*(1+1)=4.

In this case, perhaps the CH2's Hs would be a quartet, and the CH's Hs would be doublet of triplets.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps the CH2's Hs are a quartet, and the CH's Hs are a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the problem says that the NMR shows several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl Hs. So, all are aliphatic.

Another thing to consider is symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, some Hs would be equivalent, leading to fewer signals.

Looking at option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

The two middle CH groups are identical, each attached to a C2H5 and a CH2 group. So, their Hs would be equivalent, giving a single signal for both.

Similarly, the CH2 group would be next to two identical CH groups, so their Hs would be equivalent, giving a single quartet.

In this case, the CH groups would each be next to a C2H5 and a CH2 group. So, each H on the CH would be a triplet from the CH2 and a doublet from the adjacent CH. So, a doublet of triplets. If they're equivalent, that's one signal.

The CH2 group's Hs would each be next to two CH groups, each with one H, so each H on CH2 would be a quartet.

So, the NMR would have a quartet for the CH2, and a doublet of triplets for the CH Hs.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps this structure doesn't match, unless there's another coupling.

Wait, perhaps the CH groups are also coupled with the ethyl groups. So, each H on the CH is adjacent to two Hs on the ethyl group (C2H5). Hmm, but the ethyl group is attached to the CH, so the H on the CH is adjacent to the two Hs on the CH2CH2 part of the ethyl group.

Wait, that might complicate things. So, each H on the CH would be coupled with the two Hs on the ethyl group, leading to a triplet, and with the adjacent CH group's H (doublet), and perhaps the CH2 group's Hs as well.

But this is getting really complicated. Maybe I should think about each option and see which would have the required splitting.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH2CH3 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - COOH.

The CH2CH3 group is at the end. The two middle CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and another CH group.

The CH2 group before COOH is between the two CH groups.

So, the Hs on the CH groups each are adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet), and perhaps the Hs on the CH2 group (two Hs). So, each would be a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, each H on the CH is attached to a CH2CH3 group. The Hs on the CH2CH3 group are adjacent to the H on the CH group. So, each H on the CH2CH3 would be a triplet (from the adjacent CH's H).

Wait, but the CH2CH3 group is attached to the CH group, so the Hs on the CH2CH3 (the CH2 part) are adjacent to the H on the CH group. So, each H on the CH2CH3 would be a triplet.

But the problem says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl H, but that includes all the Hs in ethyl groups, etc.

But the key here is the splitting patterns in the NMR. The problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm, perhaps in option D, the CH2 group next to the COOH is between two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would be a quartet (from the two CH Hs). Then, each of those would be split by the Hs on the adjacent CH groups, but perhaps that's already accounted for.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on the CH2 group (the one before COOH) are each adjacent to two Hs from each CH group. So, each H on the CH2 would be split into a quartet (since 2+1=3, but wait, two Hs would split into a triplet. Wait, no: if a proton is adjacent to two equivalent Hs, it would be a triplet. If adjacent to two nonequivalent Hs, it could be a doublet of doublets. But in this case, the two Hs on the adjacent CH groups are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, so each H on the CH2 would be a triplet. Then, perhaps each triplet would be split again by another group.

Alternatively, maybe the Hs on the CH2 group are split by the Hs on the adjacent CH groups (two Hs, each from a different CH) and also by the Hs on the ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to think about the number of neighboring Hs each proton is seeing.

The NMR data says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

So, for the first signal: each peak is a doublet (from one H neighbor), then each of those is a triplet (from two H neighbors), then each of those is a quartet (from three H neighbors). So, this proton is coupled to three different sets of Hs with different coupling constants.

For the second signal: each peak is a doublet (from one H neighbor), then a triplet (from two H), then another triplet (from two H). So, coupled to three different sets, but perhaps two with two Hs and one with one.

Looking at the options, which structure would have a proton that is coupled to three different sets of Hs, each with varying numbers.

Option D: The H on the CH2 group (next to COOH) is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H. So, each H on the CH2 would be a quartet from the two CH groups (since (1+1)*(1+1) =4). Then, perhaps the CH2 Hs are also adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl group. The ethyl group attached to the CH would have two Hs on the CH2CH3. So, each H on the CH2 would also couple with those two Hs, leading to another layer of splitting. So, the quartet would split into a triplet (from the CH2CH3's two Hs), making a quartet of triplets.

But the NMR signal in the problem is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the order wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH2 group is coupled with:

- The two Hs on the adjacent CH groups (each with one H, so quartet)
- The two Hs on another adjacent group (triplet)
- And another group (doublet)

This would lead to a quartet, which is then split into triplets, then into doublets, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH group (the middle ones) in option D is coupled with:

- The H on the adjacent CH group (doublet)
- The two Hs on the ethyl group (triplet)
- The two Hs on the CH2 group (quartet)
So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of quartets.

That would match one of the signals described in the problem.

Another H in the molecule, perhaps the H on the ethyl group, would be adjacent to the H on the CH group (triplet), and perhaps coupled with other groups, leading to a doublet of triplets of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, let's look at option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - COOH.

The two CH groups are each attached to a CH3, and the CH2 is next to them.

Each H on the CH groups is adjacent to a CH3 (which has three Hs, but they are all equivalent, so the CH H would be a quartet from the three Hs on the adjacent CH3. Wait, no, the CH3 is a substituent, not adjacent in a coupling sense. Wait, no, coupling occurs between adjacent Hs on neighboring carbons. So, the CH3's Hs are on a different carbon, so perhaps they don't directly couple with the H on the CH group.

Wait, the CH group is attached to a CH3, so the H on the CH is adjacent to no Hs on the CH3, since they are on separate carbons. So, the H on the CH would only couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH group and the CH2 group.

In this structure, each CH group is attached to a CH3 and a CH2 group.

So, the H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet). So, each H on the CH would be a doublet of triplets.

The CH2 group is between the two CH groups and the COOH. So, each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs from each CH group. Each CH group has one H, so each H on the CH2 would be a quartet (from two CH Hs: (1+1)*(1+1)=4). Then, perhaps the CH2 Hs are also adjacent to the Hs on the adjacent CH groups, but that might have already been accounted for.

So, the CH2 group would show a quartet, and the CH groups would show a doublet of triplets.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in option A, the structure is more complex, leading to more splitting.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

The structure is CH3 - C(H)(C2H5) - C(H)(C2H5) - CH2 - COOH.

Each CH group is attached to a C2H5 and another CH group.

So, each H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet). So, each H on the CH would be a doublet of triplets.

The CH2 group is between the two CH groups and the COOH. Each H on the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs from each CH group (each CH has one H, so two Hs total), making each H on the CH2 a triplet (from two Hs). But since the CH2 is between two identical CH groups, perhaps the Hs on the CH2 are a triplet.

Additionally, the CH2 group is adjacent to the ethyl groups on the CH groups. Each C2H5 group has two Hs on the adjacent CH2CH2 part. So, each H on the CH2 would also be adjacent to two Hs from each C2H5 group. Wait, no. The C2H5 is attached to the CH group, so the Hs on the C2H5 are on a different carbon. So, the Hs on the CH2 would not be adjacent to them, so no coupling there.

Wait, perhaps the Hs on the CH2 group would be adjacent to the Hs on the C2H5 groups on the CH groups. But that would require the CH2 group to be next to the CH2 part of the ethyl group, which it isn't. So, perhaps the CH2 Hs are only adjacent to the CH groups.

So, the CH2 group's Hs would be a quartet, due to coupling with two Hs (each from the CH groups), but wait, if each CH group has one H, the CH2 Hs would be a triplet (from two Hs).

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about which options don't have any vinyl Hs, which are all the options, so that's not helpful.

Another thought: the presence of a COOH group would cause the adjacent Hs (alpha Hs) to be deshielded and possibly split. But in the given data, the NMR shows several peaks, none of which are vinyl, so that's consistent.

Wait, the problem mentions that the NMR has several peaks, none of which are vinyl. So, all the Hs are in aliphatic regions, which none of the options have any aromatic or vinyl Hs.

Now, considering the splitting patterns again, perhaps the Hs on the CH groups are the ones causing the complex splitting.

In option C, the two CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and a CH2 group. So, each H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

The CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to two CH groups (each with one H), so each H on the CH2 would be a quartet.

So, in the NMR, the CH2 would show a quartet, and the CHs would show a doublet of triplets.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps option C doesn't fit.

Option A: Each CH group is attached to a C2H5 and another CH group. So, each H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets. Additionally, the Hs on the CH groups are adjacent to the ethyl groups. The ethyl groups have two Hs on their CH2 part, which are adjacent to the H on the CH group, so each H on the CH would also be a triplet (from the ethyl's two Hs). So, each H on the CH would be a doublet (from the adjacent CH H) and a triplet (from the ethyl Hs), making a doublet of triplets. Then, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs would be a quartet (from the two CH Hs), and also coupled with the ethyl Hs, leading to more splitting.

But I'm not sure that matches the given data.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is option A. Let me think again.

In option A, the CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 and another CH group. So, the Hs on the CH groups are adjacent to:

1. The H on the other CH group (doublet)
2. The two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet)
3. The two Hs on the adjacent C2H5 group (triplet)

So, each H on the CH would be a doublet (from CH), then each of those would split into a triplet (from CH2), and then each of those would split into a triplet (from C2H5), making a doublet of triplets of triplets. That matches one of the signals in the problem.

Additionally, the CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to two CH groups (each with one H), making a quartet. But perhaps those Hs are also adjacent to the ethyl groups, leading to another layer of splitting. So, the CH2 Hs could be a quartet split into a triplet, making a quartet of triplets. But the problem says one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the Hs on the CH2 group in option A would be a quartet from the two CH Hs and a triplet from the ethyl Hs, leading to a quartet of triplets, which would be more complex.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of signals expected in each option.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

The structure is symmetrical, so the two CH groups are equivalent. So, their Hs would give a single doublet of triplets. The CH2 group is also between two identical CH groups, so their Hs would give a quartet. The ethyl groups in option A would lead to more splitting but may not match.

Wait, the problem states that one of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, that would imply a proton that is split by three different groups, each contributing to the splitting.

In option A, the CH groups are each next to a CH2 group and a C2H5 group. So, perhaps the H on the CH is coupled with:

1. The H on the adjacent CH group (doublet)
2. The two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet)
3. The two Hs on the C2H5 group (triplet)

So, the splitting would be doublet of triplets of triplets, which matches one of the signals in the problem.

Another H in the molecule, perhaps the H on the ethyl group's CH2, would be coupled with the H on the adjacent CH group (triplet), and perhaps with other groups, leading to a doublet of triplets of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH2 group (next to the COOH) is coupled with:

1. The two Hs on each adjacent CH group (quartet)
2. The two Hs on the ethyl group (triplet)
3. Any other groups?

This might lead to a quartet of triplets, but I'm not sure if that's what the problem describes.

Alternatively, let's look for the option where a CH group is next to a CH2 group, which is next to a COOH. That might lead to the CH2 group's Hs being coupled with the two CH groups, giving a quartet, and perhaps also coupled with the Hs on another group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think again about option D.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH.

Structure: CH2CH3 - C(H)(CH3) - C(H)(CH3) - CH2 - COOH.

The Hs on the CH groups are each attached to a CH3 and another CH group. So, each H on the CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH group (doublet) and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets.

Additionally, the Hs on the CH groups are also adjacent to the ethyl group's Hs. The CH2CH3 group's Hs are adjacent to the H on the CH group, so each H on the CH2CH3 would be a triplet.

But wait, the problem says that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps the H on the CH2 group (the one before COOH) is adjacent to two CH groups, each with one H, making a quartet, and also adjacent to the Hs on the ethyl group, making a triplet. So, the quartet would split into a triplet, leading to a quartet of triplets.

But the problem states one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which seems different.

Alternatively, perhaps the H on the CH group (middle in D) is coupled with:

1. The H on the adjacent CH group (doublet)
2. The two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet)
3. The two Hs on the ethyl group (triplet)

So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of triplets, which matches one of the signals.

Another H, perhaps on the ethyl group's CH2, would be coupled with:

1. The H on the adjacent CH group (triplet)
2. The two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group (quartet)
3. Any others?

Hmm, perhaps leading to a triplet of quartets, which would be a quartet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think I'm going in circles here.

Another approach: look for the number of signals expected. Each option's structure may lead to a different number of signals. The problem says "several peaks", so perhaps more than two.

But without more info, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

The FTIR shows a strong peak at 1700, which is a carbonyl. The broad peak at 3000 is O-H (carboxylic acid).

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl Hs means no doublets from alkenes.

The presence of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH group might lead to a quartet (if coupled to two Hs).

But the key is the splitting patterns.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH.

Because in this structure, the CH groups are each attached to a C2H5 group and another CH group. So, the Hs on the CH groups would be adjacent to:

- The H on the other CH (doublet)
- The two Hs on the adjacent CH2 group (triplet)
- The two Hs on the C2H5 group (triplet)

So, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets of triplets, which matches one of the signals.

Another H, perhaps on the CH2 group, would be adjacent to two CH groups (each with one H), making a quartet, and perhaps adjacent to the C2H5 Hs, making a triplet. So, quartet of triplets, which isn't exactly described, but perhaps in the problem, it's the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group's Hs are a quartet from the two CH groups and a triplet from the ethyl groups, leading to a quartet of triplets (which is a more complex splitting).

But the problem specifies one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the fact that one of the NMR signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets suggests that the proton is coupled to three different groups, each with different numbers of Hs.

Suppose the proton is on a CH2 group that's between two CH groups and another group. Let's think about option D again.

In option D, the CH2 group is between the two CH groups (each with one H) and the COOH. So, each H on the CH2 would be coupled with the two CH groups (each with one H) → quartet. Additionally, the CH2 is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2, which has two Hs. So, each H on the CH2 would also be coupled with those two Hs → triplet. So, the splitting would be quartet (from CH groups) → each split into triplets (from ethyl's CH2), resulting in a quartet of triplets. But the problem describes one signal as a doublet of triplets of quartets, which is the opposite order.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is quartet → triplet → doublet.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A because it has more substituents, leading to more splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think about option C again.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH.

Structure: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

The CH groups are each attached to a CH3. So, the H on each CH would be adjacent to the H on the other CH (doublet) and the two Hs on the CH2 group (triplet), leading to a doublet of triplets. The CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to two CH groups (each with one H), leading to a quartet.

So, the CH2 would show a quartet, and the CHs would show a doublet of triplets.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So, perhaps the CH group's Hs are coupled with another group, leading to more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the CH group's Hs are also adjacent to the CH3 groups. But the CH3 groups are attached to the same carbon as the CH group, so their Hs are not directly adjacent. So, no coupling there.

Thus, in option C, the CH groups' Hs would only be coupled with the adjacent CH and CH2, leading to a doublet of triplets, and the CH2 would be a quartet.

But the problem requires more complex splitting, so perhaps option C doesn't fit.

Putting it all together, I'm starting to think that option D is the correct answer.

In option D, the Hs on the CH groups are adjacent to a CH2 group (two Hs) and another CH group (one H). So, each H on the CH would be a doublet of triplets. The CH2 group's Hs would be adjacent to two CH groups (each with one H), making a quartet. Additionally, the CH2 group is adjacent to the ethyl group's CH2, which has two Hs. So, each H on the CH2 would be a quartet (from the two CH Hs) and a triplet (from the ethyl's CH2 Hs). So, the splitting would be a quartet of triplets.

But the problem states that one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, which seems like the opposite order.

Alternatively, perhaps the order doesn't matter as much, and the key is the presence of three layers of splitting.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another thought: the signals in the NMR are described as a doublet of triplets of quartets and a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, perhaps the first is for a CH group's H and the second for an ethyl group's H.

In option D, the CH group's H would be a doublet of triplets, and the ethyl group's H would be a triplet of triplets or something else. But I'm not sure.

I think I've spent enough time thinking, and I'll go with option D as the correct answer.


The question involves identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid) and a strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl group, C=O). The 1H NMR spectrum indicates several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, and two specific splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
