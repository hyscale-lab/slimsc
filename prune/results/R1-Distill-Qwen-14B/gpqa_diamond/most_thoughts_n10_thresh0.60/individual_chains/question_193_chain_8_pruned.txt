Okay, so I have this astronomy question, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. I'm supposed to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is the distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, the question says the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So substituting plx in terms of r, we get N ∝ (r)^5. Because 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance (per unit range of distance). Oh, that means we're looking at the change in N as r changes by a small amount, so the derivative of N with respect to r. 

Let me think. If N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is 5*r^4. But wait, the question isn't directly about the derivative; it's about how the number changes per unit
