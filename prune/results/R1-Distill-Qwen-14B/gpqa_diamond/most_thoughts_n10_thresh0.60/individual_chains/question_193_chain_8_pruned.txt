Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given that the number varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the distance is in parsecs. The formula I remember is distance (d) equals 1 divided by the parallax (p), so d = 1/p. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes, meaning they appear to move more in the sky.

So, the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). Let me write that down. N ‚àù 1/(plx^5). And I need to find how N changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I need to express N as a function of distance r (since r is distance) and find how it varies, like the derivative or something.

Wait, but maybe I should think about it in terms of how N relates to the volume or something. Because the number of stars you see depends on how much volume you're looking into. The more volume, the more stars you can see, assuming a uniform distribution.

Oh right! The number of stars
