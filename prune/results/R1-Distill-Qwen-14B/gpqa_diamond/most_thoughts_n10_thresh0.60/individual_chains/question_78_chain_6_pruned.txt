Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a scenario where a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is after the time tr when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, d must be related to the position of the charge at tr, I think.

I remember that when charges are moving, you have to consider both the scalar potential V and the vector potential A. The fields are derived from these potentials via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential is usually due to the charge itself, and the vector potential comes from the motion of the charge.

Wait, the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward: V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point of observation. But since the charge is moving, how does that affect V and A?

Oh, right! When the charge is moving, there's this thing called retarded time. The fields at a later time t depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr. The distance d would then be the vector from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.

So the scalar potential V would be based on the charge's position at tr. But wait, the expressions in the options don't all directly show that. Let me look at the options.

Option C and D have expressions with (dc - d·v) and (dc + d·v) in the denominator. Hmm, I think this has to do with the Lorentz transformation or the way the potentials are transformed when considering motion.

Wait, another approach. The scalar potential V is given by the static solution, but when the charge is moving, it's not so simple. No, wait, actually, the scalar potential still depends on q and the distance, but perhaps with some correction due to motion.

Wait, no. The scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just q/(4πε₀ r). Because the charge's motion affects the fields. Oh, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think about how potentials are constructed.

The scalar potential V
