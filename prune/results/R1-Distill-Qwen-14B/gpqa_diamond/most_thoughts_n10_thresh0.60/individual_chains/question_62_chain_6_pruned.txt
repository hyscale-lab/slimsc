Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Let's parse that name. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then there's a substituent at position 1, which is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So, that's a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, and that CH2-OH is connected to the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, so the structure is cyclohexane with a CHO group and another substituent at the same carbon? Or maybe the substituent is on a methyl group attached to the cyclohexane? Oh wait, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexane has a carbaldehyde (CHO) at position 1. At the same carbon (position 1), there's a methyl group that's substituted with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. So the structure is:

The cyclohexane ring has a -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the same carbon as the CHO group. So, the molecule would look something like:

Cyclohexyl-C-CH(OH)-Cyclohexane?

Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. So, the cyclohexane ring has a substituent at position 1. That substituent is a methyl group (CH2) but actually wait, it's CH connected to two cyclohexyl groups and an OH. No, noâ€” wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, so that's a CH2 group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl attached. So, CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl? Or CH with both groups?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group where one H is replaced by OH and another H by
