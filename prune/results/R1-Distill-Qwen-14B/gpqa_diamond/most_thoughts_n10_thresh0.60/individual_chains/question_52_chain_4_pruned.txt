Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves stars, their effective temperatures, and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in different energy levels. Oh right, when there are spots on the star, the overall temperature changes, and that affects the ratio. I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation and how the excitation of atoms depends on temperature.

Wait, the question says when the star doesn't have spots, its Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait a second, when the spots are present, the star's overall photospheric temperature is 5500 K. But wait, aren't the spots themselves cooler than the surrounding photosphere? So the spots would have a lower temperature, but the question says that the overall Teff is 5500 K. So maybe the star's average temperature is 5500 K when spots are present.

The main point is that when the star has spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere is lower, and this affects the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower compared to when it doesn't.

So, the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in level 2 to level 1 (or vice versa) is changing. Let me recall the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in
