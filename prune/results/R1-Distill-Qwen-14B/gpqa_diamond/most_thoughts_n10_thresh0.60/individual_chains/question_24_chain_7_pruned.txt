Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully again.

So, the problem is about some mixtures undergoing various reactions. The main points are:

1. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Decolorizing bromine usually means they have double bonds, maybe alkenes or something similar. So X could be a mixture of alkenes or perhaps an alkene and another diene or something. But since there are two liquids, maybe they are different alkenes.

2. When mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) when heated, it forms mixture Y, which is also equimolar but made of two different liquids. Moreover, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the products after reaction with Pt have no double bonds. Because if they did, they would still decolorize bromine. So maybe the alkenes in X are hydrogenated to alkanes in Y. But wait, the question says it's a disproportionation reaction. Oh, right, after treatment with Pt, it's a disproportionation. Hmm, wait, what's a disproportionation reaction? That's when a substance is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one of the components in X is undergoing disproportionation.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. So perhaps each component undergoes a reaction. Or perhaps it's one of the components that's undergoing a disproportionation. Wait, but when X is treated with Pt under heat, it leads to Y, which is a mixture of two liquids from disproportionation. So maybe the two components in X are each undergoing a reaction, but not sure yet.

Wait, the result is a mixture Y of two other liquids, and that Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y must have single bonds, no double bonds. So perhaps X's components are dienes or something else.

Wait, but if X's components are alkenes, then hydrogenation (Pt catalyst) would add H2 and make alkanes. But wait, the problem says that when X is treated with Pt (and heated?), it forms Y through a disproportionation, which is a different pair of liquids.

Wait, but the hydrogenation of X and Y under severe conditions gives a single substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. So Z
