Okay, so I have to find the normalized eigenvector for the quantum operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, with the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, let me think.

First, I remember that for spin systems, the Pauli matrices represent the spin operators. Each component of the spin operator is given in the problem. So the operator P is a vector operator, and we need to find its eigenvector along a direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the direction vector n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. That means n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. So the operator we're interested in is P·n, which is the dot product of the operator vector P with the direction vector n.

So P·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction component. Since n is in x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero, so the P_y term will vanish. So P·n = P_x * nx + P_z * nz.

Given that, the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>, because that's the eigenvalue given.

Now, the matrices for the components are given. Let me write them down again.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P·n is (ħ/2) [ nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. Combining the two matrices:

nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

So the operator becomes (ħ/2) * [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix. Since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, the equation is:

(ħ/2) [[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

Dividing both sides by ħ/2, we get:

[[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix equation is:

nz*a + nx*b = a
nx*a - nz*b = b

Let me write these as two equations:

1. (nz - 1) a + nx b = 0
2. nx a + (-nz - 1) b = 0

Wait, no, wait. Let me rearrange equation 1:

nz a + nx b = a → (nz -1) a + nx b =0

Equation 2:

nx a - nz b = b → nx a + (-nz -1) b =0

So, we have a homogeneous system. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

But wait, for the eigenvector, the eigenvalue equation is (M - λ I) v = 0. So perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, since the eigenvalue is known, we can directly find eigenvectors. But perhaps it's easier to express the matrix M = [[nz, nx],[nx, -nz]] and find its eigenvectors for the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is [ (nz a + nx b) = a, nx a - nz b = b ]

So, equation (1): (nz -1) a + nx b =0
Equation (2): nx a + (-nz -1) b=0

Let me write these as:

(nz -1) a = - nx b → equation (1a)

nx a = (nz +1) b → equation (2a)

Let me substitute equation (2a) into equation (1a).

From (2a): a = [(nz +1)/nx ] b

Substituting into (1a):

(nz-1) [ (nz+1)/nx ) b ] = - nx b

So,

(nz-1)(nz+1) / nx * b = -nx b

Multiply both sides by nx:

(nz^2 -1) b = -nx^2 b

Assuming b ≠0, we can divide both sides by b:

nz^2 -1 = - nx^2 → nz^2 + nx^2 = 1

Which is true because n is a unit vector (since it's a direction), so nx^2 + nz^2 =1, as n is in x-z plane. So this equation holds, which means the equations are consistent.

So, the eigenvectors are determined by equation (2a): a = [(nz +1)/nx ] b

But wait, I need to think about the case when nx is zero. If nx is zero, then the direction is along z-axis. Because n is in x-z plane, so if nx=0, then n is along z.

But the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so nx can't be zero in general. But perhaps in the case of nx=0, I can handle it as a special case. But for now, let's proceed with nx not zero.

So, the eigenvector components are a and b, where a = ( (nz +1)/nx ) b

So the eigenvector can be written as [ (nz +1)/nx , 1 ] scaled by b. Or, more precisely, the ratio a/b is (nz +1)/nx.

Wait, actually, the vector is [a, b] = [ (nz +1)/nx * b, b ].

So the vector is proportional to [ (nz +1)/nx , 1 ]

But I can write this as (1, [nx/(nz+1)] ), but perhaps it's better to factor out some terms.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvector is along the direction given by the components a and b. Let's express a in terms of b. So a = ( (nz +1) / nx ) * b.

So, the normalized eigenvector will have components proportional to (nz +1, nx ), because [ (nz+1), nx ] multiplied by 1/(sqrt( (nz+1)^2 + nx^2 )).

Wait, let me compute the normalization. The vector is [ a, b ] = [ (nz +1) b / nx, b ].

The square of the norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = [ (nz+1)^2 / nx^2 ) * |b|^2 ] + |b|^2.

Factor out |b|^2: [ ( (nz +1)^2 + nx^2 ) / nx^2 ] |b|^2.

But since nx^2 + nz^2 =1, let's compute (nz +1)^2 + nx^2:

= nz^2 + 2 nz +1 + nx^2

= (nz^2 + nx^2) + 2 nz +1

= 1 + 2 nz +1

= 2 (1 + nz )

So the norm squared is [ 2 (1 + nz ) / nx^2 ] |b|^2.

So |b| is set such that the norm is 1.

So 2 (1 + nz ) / nx^2 * |b|^2 =1 → |b|^2 = nx^2 / [ 2 (1 + nz ) ].

But perhaps it's easier to write the eigenvector in terms of components without scaling by b.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to find the eigenvectors without any constraints, but I'm not sure. Let me think about another method.

Wait, the operator P·n has eigenvalues ±ħ/2, since the eigenvalues of spin-1/2 operators are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvectors correspond to spin-up and spin-down along direction n.

The eigenvector for spin-up (eigenvalue +ħ/2) can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere representation.

In quantum mechanics, the spin-up state along direction n is given by:

|ψ> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |↓>

But wait, since the direction is in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 because the direction is in x-z, which is φ=0 (since y-component is zero). So, sin(θ/2) would be along x, so the phase is zero. So, the state would be cos(θ/2) |↑> + sin(θ/2) |↓>.

Wait, but wait, let's get back. The direction vector n is in x-z plane, so the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ is zero because it's in x-z plane. So the state would be:

|ψ> = cos(θ/2) |↑> + e^{i*0} sin(θ/2) |↓> = cos(θ/2)|↑> + sin(θ/2)|↓>

So the components are [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

But wait, that's the standard parametrization. So the eigenvector would be of the form [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but let me think again. The standard spin-up state along z is |↑> = [1; 0], and along x is (|↑> + |↓>)/√2, which is [1/√2, 1/√2]^T.

So if n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ?), wait no, the spherical coordinates for a
