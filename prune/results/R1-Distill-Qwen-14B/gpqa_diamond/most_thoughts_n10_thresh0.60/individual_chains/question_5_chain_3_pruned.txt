Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. 

Hmm, wait, the operator is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. So the operator P is a vector operator, right? So I think P is the sum of the components multiplied by the direction vector n. Like, P = nx P_x + ny P_y + nz P_z. Oh wait, but the direction is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So that means the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), because it's lying in the x-z plane. So ny is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

The eigenvalue equation would be P|ψ> = (+ħ/2)|ψ>. So I need to write down the matrix for P and find its eigenvectors.

Wait, the components are given as 2x2 matrices. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix is:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the matrix is diagonal: 
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P is nx * Px + nz * Pz, since ny is zero.

Let me denote the direction vector as n = (nx, 0, nz). Since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. But I don't know the exact values of nx and nz, but maybe I don't need them because the eigenvector might be in a generic form.

So let's construct the matrix for P. P = nx * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So combining these:

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2) * (nz).
The (1,2) element is (ħ/2) * (nx).
The (2,1) element is same as (1,2) because the matrix is symmetric.
The (2,2) element is (ħ/2) * (-nz).

Wait, let me compute each component:

P_matrix = [
    [ (nz * ħ/2), (nx * ħ/2) ],
    [ (nx * ħ/2), (-nz * ħ/2) ]
]

So P_matrix is:

[ (ħ/2) * nz, (ħ/2) * nx ]
[ (ħ/2) * nx, -(ħ/2) * nz ]

Now, we're looking for the eigenvectors of this matrix with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalue equation is (P_matrix - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is the eigenvalue, which is +ħ/2 here.

So let's subtract λ I from P_matrix:

P_matrix - λ I = [
    [ (ħ/2 nz) - (ħ/2), (ħ/2 nx) ],
    [ (ħ/2 nx), (-ħ/2 nz) - (ħ/2) )
]

Wait, actually, let me compute each element:

Element (1,1): (ħ/2 nz) - (ħ/2) = (ħ/2)(nz - 1)
Element (1,2): ħ/2 nx
Element (2,1): ħ/2 nx
Element (2,2): (-ħ/2 nz) - (ħ/2) = (-ħ/2)(nz + 1)

So the matrix becomes:

[ (ħ/2)(nz -1), (ħ/2) nx ]
[ (ħ/2) nx, (-ħ/2)(nz +1) ]

But since ħ/2 is a common factor, I can factor that out:

(ħ/2) * [
    [nz -1, nx],
    [nx, -(nz +1)]
]

We need the determinant of this matrix to be zero for non-trivial solutions. So set determinant to zero.

The determinant is:

(nz -1)*(-(nz+1)) - (nx)^2 = 0

Expanding that:

- (nz -1)(nz +1) - nx² = 0
- [nz^2 -
