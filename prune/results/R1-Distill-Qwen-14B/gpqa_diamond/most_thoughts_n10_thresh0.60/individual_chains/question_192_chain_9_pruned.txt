Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electric fields around a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me see. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, some positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the conductor's center. Also, the distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and l and L are both greater than R. The angle between l and s is θ.

The options are four different expressions for E. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay, so I remember from my physics classes that when dealing with conductors and cavities, there's some induced charge behavior. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces.

Wait, right! So, when a charge +q is inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (which is the outer surface of the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q, because the conductor is neutral. Then, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge +q to balance it out, since the total charge of the conductor is zero. So the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially uncharged. When you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) would have an induced charge of -q because the cavity's charge attracts opposite charges. But the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, so the outer surface will have +q. Is that right? Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must be +q.

So, the outer surface has +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So, the electric field at P due to the charges on the conductor's outer surface would be the same as if all that charge were concentrated at the center, right? Because for a spherical charge distribution, the electric field outside is like a point charge.

Wait, but the outer surface charge is +q. So the field due to the conductor's outer surface at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², since L is the distance from the center to P.

But wait, the inner surface has -q, but since P is outside the conductor, the inner charge's field would be negligible because the conductor's material shields it. Or wait, no—the inner charge's field is inside the conductor, but since P is outside, the net effect is just from the outer charge.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the conductor's inner surface is -q. The conductor's outer surface is +q. So, when we're outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's +q. So, the field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / (L)^2, because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but another thought: the field at P is due to all the charges. So, the cavity is inside the conductor. So, the +q inside the cavity and the induced charges. But wait, the conductor's inner surface is -q, so the field inside the conductor (but outside the cavity) would be zero because it's a conductor. But at point P, which is outside the conductor, the field is due to the outer surface's charge, which is +q.

So, the electric field at P is the same as if the +q were at the center of the conductor. Therefore, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Looking at the options, option B says exactly that: (1/(4πε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but another consideration: what about the charge inside the cavity? Since the conductor is uncharged, the inner surface is -q, and the outer is +q. But the charge inside the cavity is +q, but when the conductor is present, does the point P's field only depend on the outer charge +q?

Alternatively, perhaps the field at P is due to both the charge inside the cavity and the induced charges on the outer surface. But wait, the conductor's outer surface charge is +q as a result of the cavity's charge, so the net effect would be that the field outside is as if all the charge is at the center.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about Gauss's Law. Let's imagine a Gaussian surface that's a sphere of radius L, centered at the conductor's center. The total enclosed charge within this Gaussian surface would be the charge on the outer surface,
