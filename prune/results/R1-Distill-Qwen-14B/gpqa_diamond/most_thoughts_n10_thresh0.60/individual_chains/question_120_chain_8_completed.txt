Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of stars. Oh right, the parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance. So a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, "uniformly distributed" probably means that their density is uniform in space. So the number density of stars doesn't depend on where you are in space.

I think I need to find how the number of stars per unit parallax interval changes with plx. So I guess I need to relate the number of stars in a thin shell at a certain distance to the parallax.

Let me think about the volume. For stars at a distance d, the volume of a thin spherical shell would be 4πr² dr, where r is d. But since we're dealing with parallax, plx is 1/d (approximately, because plx (in arcseconds) is about 1/d in parsecs). So d = 1/plx.

So the volume of the shell is 4π (1/plx)^2 * dr. Wait, but dr is a small change in distance. So how does that relate to a change in parallax? Because plx is 1/d, a change in plx, let's say d_plx, would correspond to a change in d of about d_plx * (d^2). Because plx = 1/d → d_plx = -1/(d^2) dd. So dd = -d² d_plx. Since d_plx is small, the negative sign just indicates the direction, but we can ignore the sign for now.

So the volume element can be written in terms of plx. Let's see:

Volume = 4π (d)^2 dr 
But d = 1/plx, so Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 dr.

But dr is related to d_plx. From plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d_plx. But we're dealing with the change in plx, so maybe I should express dr in terms of d_plx.

Wait, let's express dr in terms of d_plx. If plx increases by d_plx, the distance decreases because plx and distance are inversely related. So:

dd = - (1/plx^2) d_plx.

So, substituting back into the volume:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx^2) d_plx )

But since we're considering an infinitesimal change, the negative just tells us the direction, so we can take the absolute value. So,

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d_plx )

Wait, that can't be right. Hold on, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should express the shell's volume in terms of plx. So the shell is between plx and plx + d_plx. The distance corresponding to plx is d = 1/plx. The next distance is d + dd, which would be 1/(plx + d_plx) ≈ 1/(plx) - (d_plx)/(plx^2) + ... So the shell's thickness in distance is approximately dd = - (d_plx)/(plx^2).

But the volume of a thin shell is 4π d^2 dd. Substituting d =1/plx and dd:

Volume = 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - (d_plx)/(plx^2) ) ].

Again, the negative is just direction, so take the absolute value. Then,

Volume = 4π (1/plx²) * (d_plx / plx²) ) 

So that's 4π d_plx / plx^4.

Wait, but the number of stars in that volume would be the volume multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. So the number of stars N in the shell is:

N = n * Volume = n * 4π d_plx / plx^4.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So per d_plx, that's just N per d_plx, which is n *4π / plx^4.

Wait, but the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)", so that's the number of stars in a d_plx interval. So N/(d_plx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. But that doesn't seem right. Because I thought it might be 1/plx^2, but maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait another approach: perhaps think in terms of the relation between distance and volume. The number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4π d² dr * n, where n is the number density. 

But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) d_plx. So substituting:

Number of stars = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d_plx) * n.

Again, ignoring the negative, it's 4π n (d_plx) / plx^4.

So per unit d_plx, the number is 4π n / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be A.

But wait, that seems high. I've heard that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases with increasing parallax, which makes sense because stars get sparser as you look further away. So the number per unit plx should decrease as plx increases.

But according to this, the number per unit plx is inversely proportional to plx^4. That's steeper than I would expect. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the differential. The number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + d_plx is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (d_plx) * (1/plx^2) ) = 1/plx^4 d_plx. But maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the confusion is between the number per unit parallax and per unit distance.

Wait, another approach: the number density is n stars per volume. The volume element in terms of plx is dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 (d_plx / plx^2 ), as before.

So the number is n * 4π d_plx / plx^4.

So as plx increases, number per unit plx (since d_plx is fixed) goes down as 1/plx^4.

So the correct function is 1/plx^4, which is option A. But wait, I thought the answer was B, 1/plx^2. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of number per unit volume in plx space. Hmm, maybe it's helpful to consider how many stars are in a range of plx.

Wait, the number of stars per unit volume in space is n. The number in a thin shell of radius d is 4π d² dr * n. So, N = 4 π n d^2 dr.

But d = 1/plx, so N =4 π n (1/plx)^2 * dr.

But dr is related to d_plx. dr = (d plx)^{-1} d_plx? No, perhaps another approach: express dr in terms of d_plx. Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx^2) d_plx.

So N = 4 π n (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) d_plx.

Ignoring the negative sign, N =4 π n (d_plx / plx^4).

So the number of stars per unit plx is N/d_plx = 4 π n / plx^4.

So the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but this seems counterintuitive. Let me think of a different way. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density is n.

The number of stars at a distance between d and d + dd is 4 π d² dd * n.

But since parallax plx = 1/d, then d =1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) d_plx.

Substituting, number of stars is 4 π (1/plx)^2 * ( - 1/plx^2 d_plx ) * n.

Again, N = 4 π n (-1) d_plx/(plx^4).

So number per unit parallax range is N/(d_plx) = 4 π n / plx^4.

So again, the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4. So the answer is A.

But wait, I've seen in some sources that the number of stars per unit distance (not per unit parallax) is proportional to 1/(distance squared). Because the volume of a shell at distance d is 4 π d² dr, so the number of stars in that shell is n 4 π d² dr. So per unit dr, it's 4 π n d², which is 1/(plx^2) because d = 1/plx.

Wait, but in that case, the number per unit distance is 1/plx^2, but that's in terms of distance. But the question is about the number per unit parallax.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the variables. Let me clarify.

The question says: how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx?

So, we're looking for N(> p) = number of stars with plx between p and p + delta_p.

Alternatively, the number per unit plx is dN/dp.

So, dN/dp = ?

We know that the number of stars in a shell with distance d is 4 π n (d²) dr.

But dr is related to dp. Since p = 1/d → d = 1/p.

So, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

Substituting into dN:

dN = 4 π n d² dr = 4 π n (1/p²) ( -1/p² dp )

So, dN = -4 π n (1/p^4) dp.

Thus, dN/dp = -4 π n / p^4.

The magnitude is 4 π n / p^4, so the number per unit p (parallax) increases as 1/p^4.

So that's 1/plx^4, which is option A.

Wait, but why is the derivative negative? Because as p increases, the number decreases. But the question is about the dependence, not the sign. So the magnitude is 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star. The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning their number density \( n \) is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is given by:

\[
N = 4 \pi d^2 dr \cdot n
\]

Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting this into the volume element \( 4 \pi d^2 dr \), we get:

\[
N = 4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 dr \cdot n
\]

Next, we relate \( dr \) to a small change in parallax \( d_{\text{plx}} \). From \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), taking the differential gives:

\[
dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d_{\text{plx}}
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \( N \), we find:

\[
N = 4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d_{\text{plx}}\right) \cdot n
\]

Simplifying:

\[
N = -\frac{4 \pi n}{\text{plx}^4} d_{\text{plx}}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the number of stars decreases as \( \text{plx} \) increases, which aligns with the sparsity of stars at larger distances. The number of stars per unit range of parallax is given by \( \frac{N}{d_{\text{plx}}} \), which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{N}{d_{\text{plx}}} = \frac{4 \pi n}{\text{plx}^4}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This corresponds to option **A**.
