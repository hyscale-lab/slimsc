Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question talks about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to form a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a substance similar to X.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. So, what gases fit that? Well, hydrogen has one proton and one neutron (if it's deuterium), but that's a molecule of H2, which has two atoms, each with a proton and a neutron. Wait, no, H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's deuterium), but the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons are equal. So if W is H2, each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), so H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So, 2=2, that fits. So W could be hydrogen gas, but maybe it's D2, deuterium. Alternatively, maybe another gas like O2? No, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in O-16, so O2 would have 16 each. But O is a heavier gas, maybe not. Or maybe CH4? No, that's a molecule, but probably not a gas released in such a reaction.

Wait, another thought: maybe the gas is CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 protons (C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 +16=22) but neutrons would be... C-12 has 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8 each. So 6 + 8*2 = 22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons? That would make W CO2. But wait, CO2 is not a gas with the same number of protons and neutrons per molecule. Wait, the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So for CO2, the molecule has 22 protons (6 from C and 8*2 from O), and 22 neutrons (6 from C and 8*2 from O at 16 each). Oh, wait, maybe that's correct. So 22=22, which would fit. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think about other possibilities. What about NH3? No, ammonia is a gas, but let's see. NH3 has 14 protons (N has 7, H has 1 each, so
