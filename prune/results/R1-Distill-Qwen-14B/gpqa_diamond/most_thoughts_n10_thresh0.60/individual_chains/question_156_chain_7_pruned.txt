Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and think it through step by step. 

The question involves two reactions with (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral ones. I need to figure out how many peaks each would show.

First, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA. Since (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, the epoxidation will form an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. Wait, but wait. Epoxidation via mCPBA typically follows a cyclic transition state where the peracid approaches the less substituted side, leading to the formation of the trans epoxide. Hmm, no, wait. Actually, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry of the double bond leads to the epoxide's configuration. For a trans (E) double bond, the resulting epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite faces, making it a trans epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's the same as the starting geometry because the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The reaction of mCPBA with an alkene is a pericyclic reaction, specifically an electrocyclic opening, but perhaps more accurately, it's a concerted addition. The peracid adds across the double bond, leading to the epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's configuration. For a trans (E) double bond, the epoxidation would form a trans epoxide because the two new bonds form on opposite sides. Or is it the same as the double bond's configuration? Wait, no, the double bond's substituents are in a certain arrangement, and the epoxide's substituents are on adjacent carbons, but the stereochemistry is determined by how the groups add.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Let's consider (E)-oct-4-ene.
