Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But here, it's a sum of two projectors, each for |0⟩ and |1⟩, each multiplied by 1/2. So this must be a mixed state, right? Because it's an equal probability of being in state |0⟩ or |1⟩.

Wait, but wait. The way it's written is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) all multiplied by 1/2. So each term is (1/2)|0⟩⟨0| and (1/2)|1⟩⟨1|. So each has a probability of 0.5. That makes sense for a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because for a single qubit, the completely mixed state is the maximally mixed state, which is (I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Oh wait, because I think the identity matrix for a qubit is 2x2, so I/2 would be the same as (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. So yes, ρ is the maximally mixed state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure what that means. Oh, wait, I think it refers to the Bloch sphere representation. Because for a single qubit, the state can be represented on a Bloch sphere. For pure states, the state is on the surface, and for mixed states, it's inside. The maximally mixed state should be at the center, right? Because the Bloch vector for the maximally mixed state is zero, so its coordinates (r) would be (0,0,0).

Wait, let me think about that. The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = 2*(<
