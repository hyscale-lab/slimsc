Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down what the question is saying and trying to identify each compound.

The problem mentions five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. Binary compounds mean each has only two elements, right? So Y and F in different proportions or different structures.

The first substance is A1, which is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, I remember that some fluorine compounds are strong oxidizing agents. Wait, fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent, but maybe A1 is a compound like F2O or something else. Wait, but more likely, maybe A1 is a fluoride with a high oxidation state of Y.

Wait, when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. Because the oF (I think that's the oxidation state of fluorine) in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, fluorine usually has an oxidation state of -1 in most compounds. But 31.96% of that... Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, maybe oF is the oxidation state, but 31.96% is a percentage, perhaps indicating the composition. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%". Oh,
