Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait—those numbers seem a bit odd. Oh wait, in quantum states, the vector has to be normalized. So I should probably check if this state is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component should equal 1 for a valid state.

So the components are -1, 2, 1. Let's calculate the squares: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 1 equals 6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized. That's a problem. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1. Hmm. Wait, but maybe the question expects me to normalize it before proceeding? Or perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the vector is (-1, 2, 1), but I'm supposed to ignore the normalization because the problem is about finding probabilities regardless. Wait, no, probabilities depend on the norm. So I think I need to normalize the state first. Because otherwise, the probabilities won't add up correctly.

Wait, but how? Let me think. The state vector is given as a column vector [ -1; 2; 1 ]. The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4+1 )= sqrt(6). So the normalized state is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. So I should use this normalized state in my calculations.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P has three rows. Let me write it out:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, wait, let me check again. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0). Second row: (1/√2, 0, 1/√2). Third row:
