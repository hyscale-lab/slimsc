Okay, I need to figure out the number of loops in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the loop count relates to in terms of Feynman diagrams.

I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is connected to the order of the diagram in perturbation theory. Each loop typically contributes a factor of the coupling constant, and the overall scaling can tell us about the loop order.

Looking at the expression provided: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is approximately 1/137. But more importantly, in quantum field theory, the loop expansion is usually done in terms of the coupling constants. Alpha itself is proportional to the square of the electric charge (e^2), and for non-Abelian gauge theories, there's another coupling constant g, like the strong coupling.

Wait, but in terms of loop order, each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant. For example, tree-level diagrams (no loops) have zero factors of the coupling beyond the vertices. One-loop diagrams have one factor, and so on.

But wait, sometimes the coupling constants themselves can have a certain power depending on the number of vertices. Alternatively, perhaps the power of the coupling constants can help determine the loop order.

Let me think about the structure of Feynman diagrams and their scaling with energy scales and loops. For a loop diagram, the amplitude often scales with (coupling)^L * (something with energy scales), where L is the number of loops.

Wait, another approach: the loop integrals in Feynman diagrams typically bring in factors of 4π and the energy scale. Each loop contributes an integral over a four-momentum, which introduces a factor of 1/(16π²) in 4D spacetime due to the measure (like in dimensional regularization). But wait, the expression here has (4pi)^6 in the denominator. Let me check that.

Wait, if each loop brings a factor of 1/(16π²), then for L loops, it would be (1/(16π²))^L. But the given expression has 1/(4pi)^6, which is (1/(4π))^6. Let me compute (4π)^6 versus (16π²)^L.

Hmm, 16 is 4 squared, so
