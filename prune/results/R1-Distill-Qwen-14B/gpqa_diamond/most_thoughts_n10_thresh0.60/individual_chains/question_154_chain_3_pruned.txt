Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which structure corresponds to the spectral data given. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight of the compound. There's also a peak at 158 with 32%, which makes me think about possible fragmentations or maybe an isotope. Chlorine has a significant mass (about 35), so maybe that's a Cl atom in the molecule. Because Cl has a natural abundance of about 75%, but since the molecular ion is at 100%, perhaps the Cl is part of the main molecule. The 158 peak might be the molecular ion plus a Cl isotope, but wait, molecular weight is 156, so 156 + 2 would be 158. Oh, wait, Cl has an atomic weight around 35.5, so maybe the molecule has a Cl and the other isotope? Wait, I might be getting that mixed up. Alternatively, maybe the 158 is a fragment that includes another Cl.

Looking at the IR data next. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since the compound is a white solid, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because those are often solids. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches due to hydrogen bonding. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, but maybe a bit higher if it's an acid derivative. Alternatively, esters or amides have carbonyls around there too.

Now the 1H NMR: There's a peak at 11.0 ppm as a singlet integrating for 1H. That's a very downfield shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton because those are also downfield, around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the singlet in this caseâ€”carboxylic acids are usually broad singlets because of the O-H exchange. But maybe in this case, it's a deuterated solvent or something else is going on. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but then why a singlet? Aldehydes typically are deshielded, but that would depend on substitution.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest they are adjacent to each other in a para-substituted benzene ring. So perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but if it's a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, like a di-substituted ring, but maybe one substituent is a Cl and another is a carbonyl group.

Wait, let's
