Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let me think this through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms in the photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms is related to the thermal energy of the star's atmosphere. Oh right, it's about the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium (LTE, which the question states).

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is proportional to the exponential of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Wait, in this problem, it's the same energy level but different stars, so the energy difference for the same transition would be the same for both stars. The question says the energy difference is about 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's a specific value, but perhaps we don't need to plug it in immediately.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps the ratio (N1/N2) is 2, where N1 is
