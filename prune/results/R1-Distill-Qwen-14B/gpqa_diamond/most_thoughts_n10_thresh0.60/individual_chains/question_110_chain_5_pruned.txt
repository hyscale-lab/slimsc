Okay, I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let's start by understanding the requirements.

So, the question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky. It says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, which is apparent mag <=16. So a star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be detected by HIRES, and <=17 for ESPRESSO. So for a star to be detected by both, it must have apparent V mag <=16. Because if it's brighter than (apparent mag <=16), both can see it. If it's between 16 and 17, HIRES can't see it because it's too faint for HIRES, but ESPRESSO can. But the question is which stars can be detected by both. So only stars with apparent V mag <=16 can be detected by both.

Now, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star, considering any extinction (dust reddening) if applicable.

Let's go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute mag 15.5, distance 10 pc. Apparent mag is calculated using m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d). So log10(10) is 1, so 5*1=5. So m =15.5 + 5 = 20.5 mag. Oh wait, no, wait. The formula is m = M +5*(log10(d) -1). So for d=10 pc, log10(10)=1. So m =15.5 +5*(1-1) => 15.5 +0 =15.5. Hmm, wait that's right because at 10 pc, absolute and apparent magnitudes are the same. So Star1's apparent V mag is 15.5. But wait, Star1's DEC is -75, which is in the southern hemisphere. Both observatories are in the southern and northern hemispheres; Paranal is in Chile (southern declinations are okay), Keck is in Hawaii, which is northern (so DEC -75 might be below their visible declinations, but the question says to disregard the pointing limits, so we don't need to worry about that. So Star1's apparent mag is 15.5. Now, since 15.5 is less than 16, so it can be detected by HIRES (since HIRES can go up to 16) and by ESPRESSO (up to 17). So Star1 is visible by both.

Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected with both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V mag is 16.5. That's given. So for HIRES, which requires m <=16, this star is too faint (16.5>16), so HIRES can't detect it. ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17). So Star2 can be detected only by ESPRESSO. So it won't be part of the answer.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction. The E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. The total absorption in V is 3.1 * E(B-V). So extinction A_V = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_actual + A_V. Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter
