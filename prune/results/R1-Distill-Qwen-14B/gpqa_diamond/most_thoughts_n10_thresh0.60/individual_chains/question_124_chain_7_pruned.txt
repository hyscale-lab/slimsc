Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let's read it carefully and think through it step by step. So the question is about particles being collided in a detector. The setup is that when particles collide at the center of a spherical detector, new particles are produced. These new particles are ultra-relativistic and have a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the detector's inner walls.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through. So the key here seems to be the relation between the Lorentz factor, the speed of the particles, and how far they travel before decaying or interacting. Since these are ultra-relativistic particles, I think their speed is very close to the speed of light, so maybe we can approximate their velocity as c, the speed of light. That should simplify things a bit.

Wait, but the problem mentions that one third of these particles reach the walls. So, the particles are moving outward from the center of the detector, and some of them decay before reaching the walls. So the fraction that makes it to the wall depends on how long they live or how far they can travel before decaying. The faster they are, the farther they can go in a given time, but if they decay quickly, that might limit how far they go.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about the particles' lifetime or decay rate. So maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps it's more about the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector wall compared to their lifetime. If their lifetime is such that they can only travel a certain distance before decaying, then the fraction that reaches the wall depends on their velocity. But if their velocity is higher, they'll reach the wall faster, so more of them will make it before decaying.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the velocity and the distance they can cover in the time they're alive. Let's think in terms of the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls.

The detector has a radius R = 30 meters. The time it takes for a particle moving at velocity v to reach the wall is t = R / v. Since they're moving at a relativistic speed, v is approximately c, so t ≈ R / c. Let's compute that. The speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / 3e8 ≈ 1e-7 seconds, which is 0.1 nanoseconds. That's a very short time.

Wait, but how does this relate to their decay time? Oh right, the particles are fast-decaying, so their mean lifetime τ is probably very short. The proper lifetime τ (the lifetime in their rest frame) is related to the time we measure in the lab frame. So the particle's lifetime as observed in the lab is τ' = γ τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor. So to make it reach the wall before decaying, the time it's moving must be less than its lab frame lifetime.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about this. The particles are created at the center, so they have to travel a distance R = 30 meters. The time it takes in the lab frame is t = R / v. But in their own rest frame, their lifetime is τ, so from our lab frame, their lifetime is longer: τ' = γ τ. So for a particle to reach the wall, the time it takes (t) must be less than its lifetime τ' → t < τ' → R/(v) < γ τ.

Wait, but if the particle's lifetime is τ, then the fraction that decays before reaching the wall depends on the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall versus their lifetime. If t is much smaller than τ, almost all particles would reach the wall. But if t is comparable to or larger than τ, then a significant fraction would decay.

But wait, the problem states that with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third
