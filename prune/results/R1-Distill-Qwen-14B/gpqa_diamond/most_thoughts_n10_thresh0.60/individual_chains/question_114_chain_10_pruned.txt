Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these reactions, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem has two parts. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I need to pick the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

Hmm, let's start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Reacting ketones with NaCN—wait, what reaction is that? Oh right, the nucleophilic addition to ketones. So ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions with reagents like HCN, NaCN, etc. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions, right? So in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone would react with CN-.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the CN- would add to the carbonyl carbon, right? So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2-CN. But with substituents. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the structure: 

The carbon chain is four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. The second carbon has a hydroxyl and a methyl group. So it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, the structure might be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the substituents would be on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the product is formed via a different mechanism.

Wait, the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with NaCN, in acidic conditions, perhaps via a hydrolysis reaction. Wait, no, wait—wait. Wait, I think that when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN- in acid), it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product is a cyanohydrin, which is a compound with a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

So for butan-2-one, adding CN- via acid catalysis would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN,
