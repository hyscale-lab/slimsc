Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is often involved in nucleophilic substitution or addition reactions. Butan-2-one is a ketone, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I should recall that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide source, perhaps under specific conditions, it could undergo a substitution. Alternatively, I remember that in the presence of an acid catalyst, the ketone can form an enol, which then reacts. Or maybe it's a condensation?

Wait, but in the product, we get a hydroxy group and a nitrile. So butan-2-one becomes 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. So butan
