Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC nomenclature. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a benzene ring with several substituents: a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is like an aldehyde group attached to the benzene), and a cyano group. These three are all meta to each other. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl group and a dimethyl amino group. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Additionally, the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile group. I need to find the correct IUPAC name from the given options.

Hmm, okay. Let me sketch this out mentally. Benzene rings can be tricky, but drawing a rough structure might help. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the carboxylic acid as the primary substituent. Wait, but in IUPAC nomenclature, the principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts from there.

Wait, wait. Carboxylic acids have the highest priority, so the numbering should give the carboxylic acid the lowest possible number. So the ring is numbered such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1 if possible, but let me verify. Alternatively, I think the substituents are numbered according to their positions relative to the
