Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I remember that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. So σ is a vector of the three Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. And n is a unit vector, which means it's pointing in some direction, but since it's arbitrary, I think the direction might not matter in the end.

I know that the eigenvalues of a spin operator are ± ħ/2, right? But wait, here the operator is H, which is the Hamiltonian. So I need to find the eigenvalues of H.

Wait, Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when multiplied by ħ/2, they become the eigenvalues for spin components. Oh wait, but the Hamiltonian here is a dot product of σ with n, scaled by ε.

Let me think. So σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So the operator H is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices in the direction of n.

What's the eigenvalue equation here? H|ψ> = E|ψ>, right. So to find E, the eigenvalues, I can think about the properties of σ · n.

Wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a linear combination like σ · n,
