Alright, I've got this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding their resistance to anthracnose. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each, and also double-mutants. The resistance levels are given, and I need to figure out the gene interactions.

First, what's the key here? I remember that in genetics, when looking at mutant phenotypes, especially in double mutants, we can use epistasis to determine the relationships between genes. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that suggests an epistatic relationship.

Let me list the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So it's less than wild-type (100%), but not as bad as others.
- g2: 0% resistance. That's really low, meaning the plant can't resist the fungus at all.
- g3: 50% resistance. So half as resistant as wild-type.
- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's even worse than either single mutant.
- g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2.

Hmm. So, looking at the double mutants. Let's think about each double mutant:

1. g1g3: 10%. This is lower than either g1 or g3 alone. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single mutant. What does that mean? Maybe they're in the same pathway, and knocking both out doesn't just add their effects but perhaps the product of each is additive in some way. Alternatively, they might function in parallel pathways. But I'm not sure yet.

2. g2g3: 0%. Same as g2. So when g3 is knocked out in addition to g2, the resistance doesn't get any worse than just g2 alone. That suggests that g2 is epistatic to g3. Because the double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype. So the function of G3 is downstream of G2, or G2 is upstream.

3. g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2. So when G1 and G2 are both knocked out, the resistance is same as when only G2 is knocked out. So here, G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype than g2. So the action of G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking it out would disable the pathway regardless of G1's presence.

Now, what about the single mutants? g2 is completely susceptible (0%), so G2 must be a critical gene. The question says at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream, which aligns with G2 possibly being that TF.

Looking at the data: g2 is the most severe. So it's likely that G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, including possibly G1 and G3. Because when G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes can't function, leading to no resistance.

Now, looking at the other double mutants. g1g3 is worse than either single. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the plant is more susceptible than either alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways. Because if you knock both out, the effect is more severe than either one alone. So G1 and G3 might be redundant or in parallel pathways. Redundancy means that each can compensate for the other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is worse.

Wait, but what's the exact term for this? If the double mutant is more severe than either single, that suggests that the two genes function in parallel pathways. Alternatively, they might be redundant. Redundancy would mean that each can perform the same function, so knocking both out leads to a worse phenotype than either single.

So, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either 75% (g1) or 50% (g3). So it's additive in the sense that their effects are separate. So G1 and G3 are acting in separate pathways, perhaps, and both contribute to resistance. So when both are gone, the resistance is worse.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 have pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So G2 is a TF, as it's upstream. So this option says G1 is a TF. That's not matching because from the data, G2 is the one with 0% resistance. So G2 is likely the TF.

Option B: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter. Hmm, same promoter doesn't quite make sense. If they have same promoter, then knocking out one would affect the other, but the data doesn't suggest that. The single mutants have different resistances, so their promoters are different.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I don't see evidence of that here. The question is about their function in resistance. Also, from the data, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So in the double g1g2, the resistance is same as g2, which suggests that G2 is upstream. So G1 can't be epistatic towards G3. Because in the double g1g3, the effect is worse than either, which suggests that they are in parallel pathways. So their epistatic relationship is that knocking both out makes things worse, so they are additive but perhaps not epistatic to each other.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, gene redundancy would mean that each can do the other's job. So if G1 is redundant with G3, knocking both out would have a worse effect than either single. Which is exactly what the g1g3 case shows (10% vs 75% and 50%). So that makes sense for redundancy. But the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but in the double g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so they are not epistatic to each other. Epistatic would mean that one masks the effect of the other.

Wait, but in the g1g2 double mutant, the resistance is same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G1. Similarly, in g2g3, same as g2, so G2 is epistatic to G3. So G2 is the upstream gene, a transcription factor.

So looking back at the options, which option has G2 as TF, and in the case of G1 and G3, they are redundant.

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but if they're redundant, then knocking both out would make them additive, but the epistatic part isn't clear between G1 and G3. Because in the double mutant, the effect is worse, meaning that they are not epistatic to each other. So perhaps the correct term is redundancy, not epistasis.

Let me think again. The term in the options: gene redundancy refers to when two genes can perform the same function. So when you knock out both, the effect is worse than either, which is what's seen here (g1g3 is 10%). So that's correct for G1 and G3.

So for the epistatic relationships, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream. If G2 is the TF, then without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function, hence the severe phenotype in g2, g1g2, and g2g3.

So looking at the options again:

Option C) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. No, because G1 is not epistatic to G3. Because in the double mutant g1g3, the effect is worse than either, so they are in parallel, not one masking the other.

Option D) G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Wait, but if they are redundant, the presence of G1 might mask the effect of G3, so if both are knocked out, you see a worse phenotype. Wait, but in this case, the single mutants have lower resistance: g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. So if G1 is epistatic towards G3, would that mean that in the double mutant, the resistance is determined by G1? But here, the double mutant is worse than either, which suggests that they are additive, not epistatic.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify what epistasis is. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then knocking out A will mask the effect of B. So in a double mutant of A and B, the phenotype will be the same as the single mutant of A. For example, if A is epistatic to B, then a double mutant A- B- would have the same phenotype as A-.

In this case, the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 both have the same phenotype as g2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

What about the other combinations, like g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single, so in this case, their effects are additive, not epistatic. That suggests that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive, leading to a worse phenotype.

So, G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, perhaps, each contributing to resistance. So knocking both out removes both contributions, leading to more susceptibility.

So the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways (or are redundant), so knocking both out leads to additive effects.

Looking at the options:

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I don't think G1 is epistatic towards G3 because their double mutant is worse than either. So that part doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the term 'gene redundancy' correct. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then the function of one can compensate for the other. So when both are knocked out, the function is entirely lost, leading to a worse phenotype. So that fits with the g1g3 data.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But if they're redundant, then neither is epistatic towards the other. Because the double mutant's phenotype is worse, meaning their functions are additive, not one masking the other.

Wait, so perhaps the correct term is that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but function additively. But in that case, the option may not mention that.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is C.

Wait, Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that a single gene affects multiple traits. But in this context, we're only looking at resistance. So I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'pleiotropy' refers to G2 affecting multiple pathways. But I think that's not the case.

Let me go back to the options:

Looking for G2 as TF, and G1 and G3 in some additive or redundant relationship.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So in that case, when both are knocked out, the effect is additive because the redundancy is gone. So that fits the data.

But the option also says G1 is epistatic towards G3. I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the epistatic relationships are only between G2 and the others. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. But between G1 and G3, their double mutant is more susceptible than either, so they are not epistatic to each other. So the correct option must have G2 as TF, and G1 and G3 in some redundant or additive situation, perhaps.

Looking at the options:

Option A) G1 is TF. No, because g2 is the most severe, which is more likely the TF.

Option B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter. No, because the single mutants have different resistance levels.

Option C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropy, G1 epistatic to G3. Not sure about pleiotropy.

Option D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3. Hmm.

Wait, in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either, so that's additive. So G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, meaning that their functions are additive. So this suggests that they're not epistatic to each other but are instead in parallel pathways, perhaps redundant. So the option that best fits would be D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, but then the third part of the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But if they're redundant, knocking both out doesn't lead to an epistatic situation. So perhaps the third part is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the option. Let me read the options again.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. So gene redundancy is correct because they're additive in the double mutant. But the epistatic part is confusing. If G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance should be same as g1 or same as g3, whichever is more severe.

But in reality, the g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either, so that doesn't fit. So perhaps the third part is wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct option is C, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The data:

g2 has 0% resistance. So G2 is critical.

In the double mutants involving G2 (g1g2, g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

G1 has 75%, G3 has 50%. So without G1, resistance is reduced but not gone. Without G3, resistance is halved.

In the double mutant g1g3, resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So G1 and G3 must be contributing to resistance in separate pathways. So their functions are additive, not epistatic.

So, the conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor upstream, and G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways (additive), providing some level of redundancy. So, when both are knocked out, the effect is worse.

Looking at the options, which option states that G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and possibly something else.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit with the data. Because in the double mutant, it's worse, which isn't epistatic.

Wait, let me think about what 'gene redundancy' means. If two genes are redundant, they can perform the same function. So knocking both out would lead to a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. Which is exactly what happens in g1g3: 10% is worse than 75% (g1) and 50% (g3). So this fits. So G1 and G3 are redundant.

But what about epistasis between G1 and G3? There's no epistatic relationship between them because their double mutant is worse, not the same as either. So the option that says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is TF, would be correct.

Looking back at the options:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, the last part about epistasis is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's consider each option's statements.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that one gene affects multiple traits, but I don't think that's the case here. The question is about resistance; each gene's effect is on the same trait.

So, perhaps the correct option is D, even though the last part doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps the last part isn't directly relevant.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main points are:

- G2 is a TF, since its knockout is the most severe and upstream.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are either in parallel pathways (redundant) because their double mutant is more severe.

So the correct option should reflect that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But the third part says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which I don't think is correct. So perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but among the options, D is the closest.

Wait, looking again, the options don't all have all the three aspects. Let me read the options.

Option D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But, in our case, G1 and G3 are redundant, but there's no epistatic relationship between them. So perhaps the third part is incorrect. But in the data, when both are knocked out, their effect is additive, which doesn't involve epistasis.

So, maybe the correct option is A, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option that correctly states G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 show redundancy, without the epistatic part.

But looking at the options, none of them have exactly that. Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance.

But looking for that in the options, the only option that says G2 is TF and G1 and G3 are redundant is D. So perhaps I have to go with that.

Wait, but the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what 'gene redundancy' implies. If two genes are redundant, knocking one out may not cause a phenotype, but knocking both out would. So in the case of g1 and g3, their single knockouts are viable (g1 at 75%, g3 at 50%), but the double is worse (10%). So that fits with redundancy.

So, the correct conclusion is that G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G2 is epistatic to both. So, looking at the options, which one matches this.

Option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which might not be correct. So perhaps the correct option is not D.

Wait, looking again, the options only have three parts each, and I'm to choose based on which is the best fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But G1 and G3 don't show pleiotropy—each affects the same trait (resistance) in their own way.

So perhaps the best option is D, despite the third part, because the first two points fit.

Wait, another approach: In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either. So this suggests that both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance, and their functions are additive. So they're in separate pathways. Therefore, this is not epistasis; it's additive. So in the options, the part about G1 being epistatic to G3 is incorrect. So perhaps the correct option doesn't have that.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an option that doesn't mention the third part conflictingly. Let me see.

Looking through all options:

A) G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1.

No, since G2 is the TF, not G1.

B) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1.

No, because same promoter is unlikely, and G3 isn't epistatic to G1.

C) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 pleiotropic, G1 epistatic to G3.

No, because G1 and G3 aren't pleiotropic.

D) G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic to G3.

Hmm. So, the first two parts fit, but the third part doesn't. So perhaps this isn't the right option.

Wait, maybe the question is about what conclusion we can draw, and the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are additive (redundant). So the correct option would have G2 as TF, and G1 and G3 as redundant, without any incorrect epistatic statement.

But looking at the options, none do that. So perhaps the correct option is D, despite the third part, because the other parts fit. Or perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic part refers to G2 being epistatic to both, but the option doesn't mention that. So, perhaps the correct option is C or D.

Wait, another way: which option correctly states that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3?

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. But the option says G2 is epistatic towards G1, but not towards G3.

No, because in the double mutant g2g3, the resistance is same as g2.

Similarly, option D says G2 is TF, but doesn't state the epistatic relationship towards G1 and G3. Hmm.

But the options don't all mention all three.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about what each part of the options signify.

The correct conclusion is that:

- G2 is the transcription factor upstream of the others.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, meaning that the function of G1 and G3 is downstream of G2.

- G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways (redundant), so their double mutant is worse than either single.

So, looking at the options, the correct one should have:

1. G2 is TF.

2. G1 and G3 are in some kind of redundant or additive relationship.

3. G2 is epistatic to both.

Which option combines this?

Looking again:

Option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but the third part is incorrect. So perhaps D is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's validity.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy (so their double mutant is worse than either), which is correct. But the third part says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which is incorrect because the double mutant is worse than either, so they are not epistatic.

But maybe the 'G1 is epistatic towards G3' part is a mistake, and the correct option would have that G2 is epistatic to both.

But none of the options state that. So perhaps the correct option is the one that says G2 is a TF, and the rest is about G1 and G3's relationship.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

In the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse, so G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other.

So, the epistatic relationships are only between G2 and the others.

So, the correct option must mention that G2 is a TF and epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, which options have G2 as TF and mention epistasis?

Option A: G1 is TF. No.

Option B: G2 is TF, but says G3 is epistatic to G1. No.

Option C: G2 is TF, but says G1 is epistatic to G3. Which is not correct.

Option D: G2 is TF. The last part says G1 is epistatic towards G3, which is incorrect.

Hmm. So none of the options perfectly fit. But perhaps I'm supposed to pick the best option.

Wait, the question says, which conclusion can you draw from the experiment.

The main points are:

- G2 is a TF upstream.

- G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are additive, meaning they function in parallel pathways, possibly redundant.

Looking at the options, which one includes 'G2 is TF' and 'G1 and G3 are redundant'?

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy.

The third part of the option is about G1 being epistatic to G3, which may not be correct, but perhaps the question only requires that you select the option where G2 is a TF and G1 and G3 are redundant.

So, I'd go with option D.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes (G1, G2, and G3) in white lupine plants concerning their resistance to anthracnose. The resistance levels of single and double mutants are provided, and the goal is to determine the gene interactions and functional relationships.

### Key Observations:
1. **Single Mutants**:
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (moderate reduction).
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (significant reduction).

2. **Double Mutants**:
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).

### Analysis:
- **G2 is a transcription factor (TF)**: The complete susceptibility of g2 (0% resistance) suggests that G2 is critical and likely acts upstream of other genes. The double mutants g1g2 and g2g3 also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This means G2 is required for the function of G1 and G3.

- **G1 and G3 are redundant**: The double mutant g1g3 has a resistance of 10%, which is worse than either single mutant (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). This indicates that G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways or are redundant, meaning their combined loss results in an additive effect on susceptibility.

- **No epistasis between G1 and G3**: The double mutant g1g3 does not show a phenotype identical to either single mutant, ruling out epistasis between G1 and G3. Instead, their relationship is better described as redundancy.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data clearly show G2 is the critical gene (0% resistance in g2).
- **Option B**: Incorrect. It claims G1 and G3 have the same promoter, which is unsupported by the data. Additionally, it states G3 is epistatic to G1, which contradicts the observation that the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, it claims G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, which is not supported by the data. Pleiotropy would require G1 or G3 to influence multiple traits, but the data only pertain to resistance.
- **Option D**: Correct. It correctly identifies G2 as the transcription factor and states that G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which aligns with the data. The claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is inconsistent with the observation that the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either single mutant, but this is the best overall option given the choices.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and the claim about G1 being epistatic towards G3 is likely an error in the option. 

**Answer: D**
