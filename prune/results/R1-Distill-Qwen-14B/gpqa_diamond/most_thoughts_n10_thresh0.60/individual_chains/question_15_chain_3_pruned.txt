Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting, which is important because the researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance. Let's break down what I know.

Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the key things here are their orbital periods and the host stars' properties.

Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Wait, but shorter period means it's closer to the star, right? Because orbital period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars have different masses. The star with Planet_1 is twice as massive as the one with Planet_2. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, more massive stars can have the same radius as less massive ones? Maybe they're in different stages. Like, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so maybe a subgiant or something.

The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the probability (P) is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately (R_star) / (a). But wait, another consideration: the planet's orbital distance. Because planets with shorter periods (closer-in) should have a higher probability of transiting because their orbital plane is more likely to align edge-on with our line of sight. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, the transit probability isn't just about the distance. Let me think. The probability of a transit is approximately (R_star / a), assuming the star's radius is much larger than the planet's. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula I remember is P ~ 1 / (a/(R_star)) ), but I might be mixing it up.

Wait, the probability of a transit is the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but in a way. Because for a planet to transit, its orbit must be edge-on relative to us. The probability is approximately (R*/ a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major
