Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition. Hmm, I remember the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the nucleophile attacks the beta position, forming an enolate intermediate. 

The question is about three different reactions (A, B, and C), and I need to find their products from the options given. Let me take it step by step.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as conditions. NaOEt is a strong base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diester, making it a strong base. When the enolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate), the nucleophile (from malonate) will attack the beta position of the acrylate. 

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually, the substituents are in the E configuration. So the structure is probably COOCH2-CH2-p-tolyl, but wait, wait, I think the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3? No, wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the acrylate. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. The 3-position would be the middle carbon of the three in the acrylate. So it's CH2-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the central carbon? Or perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, no, the substituent is on the 3-position. So the main chain is probably CH2-CH2, but wait, for acrylate, it's CH2=CHCOOCH3. So in this case, the substituent is on the middle carbon, making it (E) configuration? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, perhaps the acrylate is substituted on the beta position. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3, but that would be 2-(p-tolyl)acrylate, not 3. Hmm. Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl... No, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the structure. The compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the acrylate part
