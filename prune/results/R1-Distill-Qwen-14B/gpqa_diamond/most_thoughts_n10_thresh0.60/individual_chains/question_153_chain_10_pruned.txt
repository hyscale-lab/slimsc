Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition reaction, which I remember involves enolates attacking a beta position in an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Right, the Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

There are three separate reactions given, and I need to determine the major products for each. The options are labeled A, B, and C, and each option provides possible products for all three reactions.

Let's take them one by one.

Starting with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it forms the enolate, which is a strong nucleophile. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? Or wait, perhaps it's CH2-COOEt attached to a p-tolyl group at the 3 position. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester. The acrylate part is CH2=CHCOOEt. But the substituent is at the 3 position. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? No, because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. Wait, no, acrylate is (propen-2-yl) ester. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but the 3-position would be the CH2 group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Let me draw this out mentally.

Alternatively, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably CH2=CH-C(O)OEt with a p-tolyl group on the carbon adjacent to the ester. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So, substituting at the 3-position would be on the CH2. Wait, wait, no. Carbonyl is at position 1. Then positions are 1 (carbonyl), 2 (double bond to 3). So perhaps the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. The 3-position would be the CH2 group, but the p-tolyl is attached where?

Wait, maybe the structure is (E)-CH2-C(C6H4-4-CH3)=CH-COOEt? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt, but that would be at the 2-position. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, and the p-tolyl is attached to the double bond. So, structure would be
