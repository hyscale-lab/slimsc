Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), and I need to figure out which symmetries all operators must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Hmm, I remember that effective field theories are built by extending the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries they must obey.

Wait, I think both the Standard Model and SMEFT respect certain symmetries. The Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which is about how fields transform under rotations and boosts. And Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations, so that's like the spacetime symmetry group. Oh wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

So SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the SM plus higher-order terms. The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, so I guess all operators in SMEFT must too. Because if an operator doesn't respect Lorentz, it would break the theory's consistency.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes translations, so that's momentum conservation and energy-momentum relation stuff. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, it must also be Poincare-invariant because Lorentz transformations and translations are part of the same symmetry structure. So operators should respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So 1 and 2 are both in.

Now, what about CP and CPT? I remember that the SM doesn't necessarily respect CP symmetry; in fact, there's CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if SMEFT includes the SM, then some operators might violate CP. But wait, the question is what operators must respect. So maybe in SMEFT, you can have operators that break CP, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if the SM already doesn't have CP symmetry, then SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP either. So CP symmetry (3) is not a must.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. SMEFT is built to respect the same symmetries as the SM unless they're explicitly broken. The SM violates CP in some sectors, but not all. So in SMEFT, the operators can violate CP, meaning that they don't have to respect it. So the operators don't necessarily have to maintain CP symmetry.

What about CPT symmetry? I think C
