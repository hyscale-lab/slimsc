Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F. The compounds are A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. 

Let me go through what each substance does. 

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction would be something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized usually means it's acting as a reducing agent. So, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Next, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So, Y reacts with F2 to form A3. So, probably Y is in a lower oxidation state in A3. For example, if Y is in a +1 state in A3, it might be YF. But wait, fluorine usually has a -1 charge. So, for a binary compound, Y's oxidation state would be positive. Like, if Y is Na, it would be NaF. Or maybe something else.

Then, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, we get A5. So, A4 is some solution (maybe an acid?) that reacts with Y to form A5. 

In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So, when A5 is put in water, it breaks down into two products. Maybe a gas and another compound, or two different compounds.

The question is asking for the molecular weight range of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D) 110-130.

Hmm. Let's try to figure out what Y is. Since we have five binary fluorides, Y must form five different compounds with fluorine. Let me think about elements that form multiple fluorides. For example, nitrogen has NF3, N2F4, etc. Wait, but I'm not sure about five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something like sulfur? Or maybe another element.

Wait, another possibility: Y could be chlorine. But chlorine has ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. Wait, but chlorine is in group 17 as well, so perhaps not. Or maybe Y is oxygen? Hmm, O has OF2, O2F2, etc., but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is phosphorus. Let's think. Phosphorus can form PF3, PF5, maybe others, but I'm not sure if it's five. Alternatively, Y could be something like tin. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the bright-red substance A1. That makes me think of something like KMnO4, but that's with Mn, not F. Alternatively, maybe it's something like PbF2? No, that's not red. Wait, another red compound—maybe K2Cr2O7 is orange, but I'm not thinking correctly. Oh, wait, maybe A1 is fluorine's compound with another element. Alternatively, perhaps Y is in a high oxidation state.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition. A1 → A2 + F2. So when A1 decomposes, fluorine is released. That suggests that A1 is a fluorinated compound where fluorine is in a lower oxidation state. For example, perhaps A1 is YF3 and A2 is YF. Or maybe A1 is a more complex structure.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about A5. When Y is added to A4's solution, a 1:1 molar ratio, and A5 forms. Then A5 decomposes in water into two substances. Maybe A5 is a salt that forms an acid and a base upon decomposition, or perhaps it's a carbonate that breaks into CO2 and
