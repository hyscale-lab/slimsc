Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry.

First, I'll read through the problem again to get all the details.

The reaction starts with solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. When C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent.

Okay, so I need to figure out what these compounds are, probably by looking at the reactions and their products. Once I know what E is, I can determine its molecular symmetry group.

Let me start by looking for familiar reactions and products. The bright red product C after reacting with B—bright red often makes me think of things like iodine complexes or maybe some metal ions. Alternatively, maybe something like sulfur or another colored product.

Wait, the reaction with water to form A, F, and G. Since F and G are acids, they might be like sulfuric acid or another acid. Wait, but F is strong, G is weak. So, perhaps F is H2SO4 (since sulfuric is a strong acid), and G is another acid, maybe HNO3? Or wait, no, nitric is also strong. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is H2S (weak?), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps F is something else.

Let me think about the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. 8 equivalents of B. So, if B is a diatomic gas, like O2, maybe. Because 8 would suggest maybe forming something with multiple bonds.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of the possible structures. The reaction with D produces E, which is dangerous. Maybe E is something like phosgene or another highly toxic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think of a possible scenario where C reacts with D to form E. Suppose C is something like sulfur trioxide (SO3), reacting with D which could be something like Cl2. But wait, what would that form? Maybe SO3 + Cl2 → something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, the first reaction might be about a metal reacting
