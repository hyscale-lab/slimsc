Okay, so I've got this metric given here, and I'm supposed to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

Wait, first, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. I remember it's a solution to the Einstein field equations in some cases, maybe representing a universe with negative curvature.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Hmm, that looks like a two-dimensional metric, so this is a 2D space, right? But wait, pseudospheres are higher-dimensional? Oh wait no, in general relativity, a pseudosphere could be a 2D surface embedded in higher dimensions, but the metric given here is 2D. So maybe this is a model of a 2D space with constant curvature.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's a 2D surface. Let's see, the general form of a metric in 2D is ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). So the function here is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). 

I remember that for a metric of the form ds² = f(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate, the area element can be calculated using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times r dr dθ. But wait, here the metric is in terms of x and y, not polar coordinates. So perhaps I should convert it into polar coordinates. 

Wait, x² + y² could be r squared, so let me set r² = x² + y². Let me think, in polar coordinates, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². But in this case, the given metric is still in terms of dx and dy, so perhaps I can write it as:

g_{xy} = [32/(4 - r²)] (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y².

So the area element in 2D is sqrt(det(g)) dr dθ. But wait, since it's a diagonal metric, the determinant is just (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2, but since g_xy is zero,
