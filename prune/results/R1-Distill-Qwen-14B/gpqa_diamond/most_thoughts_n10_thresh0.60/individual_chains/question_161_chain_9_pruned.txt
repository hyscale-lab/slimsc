Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm. Let me try to break it down.

So the scenario is Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. To get a good image, he needs a ultra-high vacuum, right? He uses vacuum pumps to get the pressure down to less than 10^-9 Torr in the sample compartment. That's super low pressure, so there shouldn't be many gas molecules around.

But even then, some gas particles are still there, and a mass spectrometer detected them. Mike found the mean free path of these gas molecules is λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Oh right, the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is the pressure. So, under the same conditions, if pressure is lower, the mean free path is longer.

But then, when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. And the temperature is the same. So why would λ change? Mike's observation is that λ2 is different from λ1.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Hmm. Oh, maybe the electron beam interacts with the gas molecules. Like, the electrons are scattering off the gas particles. But wait, when the electrons are moving, maybe they're causing the gas molecules to move more? Or perhaps the electrons are ionizing the gas molecules, leading to more collisions?

Wait, another thought. The mean free path is the average distance a gas molecule travels between collisions. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving really fast. Do they contribute to collisions with the gas molecules? Or maybe, the presence of the electron beam causes some sort of additional effect on the gas. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more mobile, perhaps increasing the effective pressure.

Wait, but the pressure doesn't change. The pressure is still the same, right? Because the pumps are running, but maybe the beam affects the local pressure or the movement of the gas molecules.

Wait, another angle. The mean free path of electrons? Oh wait, no, the question is about the gas molecules. But when the electron beam is on,
