Alright, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. And we need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the primary fusion process in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, then pp-II goes to helium-3, and pp-III goes to helium-4. Oh, right, the pp-III branch is the main part of the proton-proton cycle that leads to helium production. So, if that stops, what happens?

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the Sun's core, right? The dominant source is the pp-III reactions. If the pp-III branch suddenly stops, then that main source of neutrinos would be cut off. But wait, the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So, are there other sources of neutrinos in the Sun?

I think there are other processes, like the CNO cycle, which also produces neutrinos but contributes a smaller fraction. And then there's the boron neutrino process, which is a minor contributor. But wait, the pp-III branch is
