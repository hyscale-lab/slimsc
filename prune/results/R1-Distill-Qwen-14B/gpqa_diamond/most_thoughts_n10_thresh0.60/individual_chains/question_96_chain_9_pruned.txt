Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the black hole's entropy. The options are A to D, with exponents ranging from 59 to 66.

Wait, I remember that the event horizon radius (R) can be found using the angular size formula. Angular size θ is approximately equal to R/d when θ is small, right? Oh wait, no, wait—that's the small angle approximation, where θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse, which in this case would be R/d. So R ≈ θ * d, but I need to make sure the units are correct.

First, let's convert θ from degrees to radians. Oh right, because the formula uses radians. So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). So θ_rad = 10^-17 degrees * π/180 ≈ 10^-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians. But maybe I can keep it as θ = 10^-17 degrees for now and just use the relation R ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but actually, the formula is R ≈ θ (in radians) * d. So I need to compute R as θ_rad multiplied by d.

Wait, but what are the units of d? It's given in parsecs. Oh, right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 10^10 parsecs = 10^10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, but let me compute R. So R = θ_rad * d.

θ_rad = (10^-17 degrees) * (π/(180 degrees)).

So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π/180 ≈ 1e-17 * 1.745e-2 = approx
