Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic compound. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, wait, 6-membered aromatic rings (like benzene derivatives) have 6 carbons, but the molecule has 8 in total. That probably means there are two substituents attached to the ring. Each substituent might contribute to the total count.

The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents on the benzene ring likely include a carbonyl group and a halogen, maybe like a ketone and a bromine or chlorine? Or perhaps an ester or amide group?

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6, so substituents add 2 carbons. But wait, that depends on the substituents. For example, if one substituent is a carbonyl group attached directly (like a ketone), that's just one substituent adding maybe one carbon? Or maybe it's part of a larger group. Alternatively, if the substituent is something like a methoxy group (-OCH3), that contributes three carbons (O doesn't count), but that doesn't have a carbonyl. So in this case, since there's a carbonyl, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group like an acetyl (COCH3) which adds two carbons (the CO is from the ring, and the CH3 is attached). Wait, but that's part of a substituent; let me think.

Wait, the substituents: di-substituted benzene. So two groups attached. One is a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone, ester, etc.), and the other is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I) because of the aromatic-halogen bond.

So substituents are X (halogen) and R (which includes a carbonyl). Let's count the carbons. Benzene is 6, substituent X is one atom (like Cl) which doesn't add a carbon. Substituent R, which is a carbonyl group, maybe something like a ketone (CO-) attached to perhaps a methyl group. For example, if R is COCH3, that's two carbons (the CO doesn't add a carbon, but the CH3 does). So 6 + 0 (X) + 2 (R) = 8. That fits.

So the structure would be something like benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. Wait, but that adds 6 + 1 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 9? Wait, no. Wait, Cl isn't a carbon. The substituents are, for example, Cl and COCH3. So the benzene ring (6 C) plus COCH3 (2 C) and Cl (0 C) makes 8 in total. So that adds up. So the substituents are a halogen and an acyl group (like acetyl).

Wait, but the substituent could also be a carbonyl group in another position. For example, another possibility is that one substituent is a carbonyl like a ketone (CO-), but that would be part of a substituent that's maybe more than just a methyl. Wait, but how else can the substituents add up to 8 carbons in total? Let me think again.

Another approach: the molecule has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more. So each substituent can't have more than two carbons combined. So perhaps one substituent is Cl (no carbons) and the other is a -COCH3 group (two carbons: the CO doesn't add a C, but the CH3 does). So that gives 6 + 0 + 2 = 8. That seems to fit.

So the structure is benzene with a Cl and a COCH3 group attached. Now, the positions matter for the NMR. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be either para, meta, or ortho. But the NMR will show different patterns based on their positions.

But wait, the substituents are a Cl and a ketone group (like COCH3). Cl is a strong deactivating group, and the ketone is also deactivating. Depending on their positions, the aromatic protons will have different chemical shifts.

But for the NMR, I'm more focused on the substituents' own protons. The COCH3 group will have a methyl group (3H) as a singlet, probably around 2.1-2.3 ppm. But wait, looking at the options, option C has a 2.3 ppm triplet (3H, s), which fits. Wait, the COCH3's methyl would be a singlet because all three are equivalent. So that's a possibility.

The aromatic protons would depend on the substituents' positions. If they are para to each other, the ring would be symmetric, leading to two sets of protons. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, the protons are in two doublets. But in our case, substituents are Cl and COCH3. So if they are para, the ring would have two sets of two protons each, each as doublets.

Wait, let me think about the substitution pattern. Let's say the substituents are meta. Then the aromatic protons would be in a different arrangement. But perhaps the substituents being para would lead to two doublets. So in the NMR, aromatic peaks would be a couple of doublets.

But let's look at the options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). The 9.9 is a singlet, likely an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde has a strong absorption in IR as well. But the question says a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc. But in this case, looking at the substituents, if one substituent is COCH3, then the aldehyde would imply another group. Wait, but the substituents are two: one Cl and one R (which includes the carbonyl). So maybe the substituent R is a carbonyl group plus another group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a bromine and a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group as part of a larger substituent, like a methoxy group, but that doesn't fit the carbonyl. Or perhaps a nitro group, but that doesn't have a carbonyl. Alternatively, a substituent like -COOH, but that's a carboxylic acid, which is possible.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl. So any carbonyl-containing group, like ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, etc. But given that the substituents should add up to 2 carbons, perhaps a substituent like -COCH3 (which is two carbons: the CO is from the ring, and the CH3 adds one, but wait, no. The CO is a substituent. Wait, COCH3 is a substituent that has one carbon in the CO and another as CH3, but that's two carbons in the substituent? Or does the CO count as part of the ring? Wait, no, because the ring is benzene. So if the substituent is a COCH3 group attached to the ring, that's two carbons: the ring's carbon is connected to the CO, which is connected to CH3. So the substituent is -COCH3, which is two carbons (the CO doesn't add a carbon, but the CH3 does). So that's correct.

So substituents are Cl and COCH3. Let's say they are para to each other. Then the ring would have two sets of two protons each, each as doublets (since each set is adjacent to a substituent). So in the NMR, the aromatic region would show two doublets. Let's see, the substituents are electron-withdrawing groups, so the aromatic protons would be deshielded, so upfield or downfield?

Well, the substituents are Cl and COCH3, which are both deactivating. So the ring is deactivating, so the protons would be in the lower ppm regions. Wait, but substituents can have different effects based on their positions. For example, para substituents can cause certain shifts.

In para substitution, the two substituents are across from each other, so the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Each set would be a pair of protons that are adjacent to each substituent. So each set would be a doublet.

Alternatively, if the substituents are meta to each other, then the ring would have more complex splitting, but let's assume for now the substituents are para.

So in the NMR, the aromatic region would have two doublets. Let's say each with 2H. So looking at the options:

Option A: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d). Yes, that's two doublets each integrating for 2H. So that fits the para substitution for the substituents.

What about the other peaks in Option A? 9.9 (1H, s) is a singlet. That could be an aldehyde proton, but earlier I thought that substituent is COCH3, which doesn't have an aldehyde. Wait, unless there's another substituent. Wait, but the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the only protons in the molecule would be from the COCH3 (3H) and the aromatic protons. So where does the 9.9 ppm singlet come from? That might not fit because our substituents don't have an aldehyde group. Maybe I made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is not COCH3 but something else. Let me think again. The substituent is another group that includes a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a ketone group attached directly, like a benzyl ketone. For example, substituent R could be a carbonyl connected to another carbon, perhaps a -CO- group with another substituent. But earlier, the substituents need to add up to 2 carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an acetylamino group, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, like -O-CO-CH3. But that would add more carbons. Let me think.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3), which is two carbons in the substituent. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

In that case, the COCH3's methyl protons would appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. Looking at the options, option C has 2.3 (3H, s), which would fit that. So what does option C look like?

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So the aromatic peaks match the para-substituted scenario, and the 2.3 is the methyl group from COCH3. That could fit.

But wait, where is the Cl? Cl doesn't have protons, so it won't show up in the NMR. The other substituent is COCH3, which contributes the methyl peak.

In the aromatic region, in option C, there are two doublets: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that suggests a para-substituted ring, where each substituent is opposite each other, so the aromatic protons are in two sets of two, each as a doublet.

But wait, in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, the protons would be in two sets. For example, if substituents are para, each substituent will have adjacent protons. Let me imagine the structure: ring with Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4. Then the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, and positions 3 and 5 would be adjacent to COCH3. Each set would be as a doublet because each proton is next to one substituent (which is an electron-withdrawing group, so deshielded).

So the protons next to Cl would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm. Wait, Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields adjacent protons, making their chemical shift downfield. COCH3 is also an electron-withdrawing group, so their adjacent protons would also be deshielded.

But which substituent is more de-shielding? Cl is more electronegative than COCH3 (which is a ketone group, also de-shielding). So the protons adjacent to Cl would have a higher ppm value than those adjacent to COCH3.

So in the NMR, the 2H adjacent to Cl would be a doublet at higher ppm (like around 7.8), and the 2H adjacent to COCH3 would be a doublet at a lower ppm (like around 7.6). So option C shows 7.8 and 7.6, which fits this idea.

So option C's NMR would have two doublets in the aromatic region and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for the methyl group.

Wait, but option A also has two doublets in the aromatic region, but with a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which I'm not sure about. Let me think again about the substituents.

If substituents are Cl and COCH3, then their NMR would include the aromatic protons as two doublets (assuming para substitution) and the COCH3 methyl as a singlet.

So option C seems to fit, but wait, in option C, the aromatic protons are at 7.8 and 7.6, which are both downfield, which makes sense because of the electron-withdrawing substituents. The methyl comes in at 2.3, which is typical for a ketone's methyl group.

But what about the IR? The IR has a carbonyl peak, which would be from the ketone group (C=O). So that's correct.

So among the options, option C has the right aromatic pattern and the methyl singlet. Let me check other options.

Option D has a 6.9 (1H, s), which might be an aromatic proton in a different environment, perhaps if there's a substituent that's meta. But I'm not sure; our substituents are para, so it's unlikely.

Option B has 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are around where you might see protons attached to oxygen, like in an ether or something, but I don't think that's relevant here.

So the correct NMR should be option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s).

Wait, but earlier I thought about the substituents being para. That would lead to two doublets, each 2H, which option C has. So I think option C is the correct answer.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons beyond the benzene ring (6 carbons). The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). 

The substituents are likely para to each other, as this would result in a symmetric aromatic ring with two sets of equivalent protons. The aromatic protons adjacent to the halogen (a strong electron-withdrawing group) would be more deshielded and appear at higher ppm, while those adjacent to the ketone group would be less deshielded and appear at lower ppm. The methyl group of the ketone (-COCH₃) would appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could correspond to an aldehyde proton. However, the substituents are a halogen and a ketone, not an aldehyde. This option is inconsistent with the substituents.
- **Option B**: Shows peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm, which are characteristic of protons attached to oxygen (e.g., in an ether). This does not match the expected substituents.
- **Option C**: Contains two doublets in the aromatic region (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) and a singlet at 2.3 ppm. This matches the expected pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a halogen and a ketone group, where the methyl group of the ketone appears as a singlet.
- **Option D**: Includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm, which could correspond to an aromatic proton in a different environment. However, the para-substitution pattern does not support this.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it aligns with the substituents (halogen and ketone) and their expected chemical shifts.

Answer: C
