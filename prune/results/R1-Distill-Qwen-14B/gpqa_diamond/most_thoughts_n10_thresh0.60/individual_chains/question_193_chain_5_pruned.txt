Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says. 

It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, so mathematically, I guess that would be N ∝ 1/parallax^5, or N = k/(parallax)^5, where k is some constant. 

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Parallax p is the reciprocal of distance. So p = 1/d, where d is the distance. Or wait, in parsecs. Yeah, because parallax in arcseconds is 1 over distance in parsecs. So d = 1/p, so p = 1/d. Got it.

So if I have N proportional to 1/(p)^5, substituting p from above, that would be N proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that. 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. 

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, so they're probably asking about the differential number of stars with distance. Like, the number of stars in a thin shell between r and r + dr. 

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number in a thin shell dr would be roughly the derivative of N with respect to r, multiplied by dr. So dN/dr = 5*d^4. That would mean that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r^4. 

Looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C. 

Wait, let me double-check. If N = k * d^5, and d is the distance, then dN/dr = 5k d^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^4. So when the distance increases, the number in each thin shell increases rapidly. That makes sense because as you go to larger distances, the volume increases, but in this case, the density might be dropping off in a certain way. 

Another angle: thinking about the volume. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r² dr. If the number of stars is
