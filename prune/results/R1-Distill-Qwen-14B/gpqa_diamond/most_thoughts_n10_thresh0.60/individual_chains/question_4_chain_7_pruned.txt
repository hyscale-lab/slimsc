Okay, so I have this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where a magnet can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Maxwell's equations, but let me think this through.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total, right? They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. I remember them as:

1. Gauss's Law for Electric Fields
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields
3. Faraday's Law of Induction
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition

But wait, in our universe, the key thing about magnets is that they can't have isolated poles, right? Magnets always have both a north and a south pole. This is because the magnetic field lines form closed loops. So Gauss's Law for magnetism says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero, which implies no isolated magnetic charges.

So if in this parallel universe a magnet can have isolated poles, that means magnetic monopoles exist. How would that affect Maxwell's equations?

Let me recall each equation:

1. Gauss's Law (Electric): ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This deals with electric charges. If magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's a similar law for magnetism.

2. Gauss's Law (Magnetic): ∇·B = 0. This is because there are no magnetic monopoles in our universe. If there were, this equation would change. So ∇·B would equal something like μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This is about changing magnetic fields inducing electric fields. I don't think this equation changes with the existence of magnetic monopoles.

4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. Wait, the original Ampère's Law without Maxwell's correction was ∇×B = μ₀ J. But in reality, Maxwell added the displacement current term. If magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's an analogous term added to Faraday's Law? Wait, no, because Faraday's Law already has the time derivative of B. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, when you have magnetic charges, both the divergence and curl of the magnetic field equations would change. Because Gauss's Law for magnetism would no longer
