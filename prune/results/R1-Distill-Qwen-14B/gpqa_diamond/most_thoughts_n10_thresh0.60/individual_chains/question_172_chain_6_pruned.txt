Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds, so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. It states that the ratio of the populations is proportional to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T). Oh right, the formula is n2/n1 = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the excitation level is twice as much in star_1. So if I let n1 be the population in star_1 and n2 in star_2 for the excited state, then n1/n2 = 2. Or wait, wait. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited"—does that mean the number in the excited state is higher? I think so. So n1 (excited in star1) divided by n2 (excited in star2) equals 2. So n1 = 2 n2.

But wait,
