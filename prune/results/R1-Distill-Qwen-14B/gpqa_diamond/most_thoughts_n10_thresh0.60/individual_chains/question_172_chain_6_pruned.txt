Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means that we can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy levels in a gas to temperature. The equation goes something like this: the ratio of the populations (n_upper / n_lower) is equal to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So for star_1, the population of the excited state compared to the ground state is higher. Let's denote n1 as the population ratio for star_1 and n2 for star_2. According to the question, n1 = 2 * n2.

Wait, actually, the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so maybe the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as much for star_1 as for star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n_upper/n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for each star, this ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

So for star_1: n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star_2: n2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the excitation is twice as much as in star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

So putting that together: exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Hmm, let me write that equation down.

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this. Let's do that.

ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T1))) = ln(2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))

Simplify the left side: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ln(exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))

Which becomes: -ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Now, rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T2 - T1) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, let me double-check that algebra. So, the expression inside the brackets:

-1/T1 + 1/T2 = ( -T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2 ) ? Wait, wait. Let's compute -1/T1 + 1/T2 as:

= ( - T2 + T1 ) / (T1 T2 )

Which is ( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 )

So going back:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

We can rearrange this as:

( T1 - T2 ) / ( T1 T2 ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But the question gives the energy difference, ΔE, as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38e-23 J is a very small number. Isn't that close to k (Boltzmann's constant) which is about 1.38e-23 J/K? Oh! So ΔE
