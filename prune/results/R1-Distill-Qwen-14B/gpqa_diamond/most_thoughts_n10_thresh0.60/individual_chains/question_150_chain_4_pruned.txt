Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The question is about identifying the final product after a series of reactions. The compound starts with the molecular formula C8H9NO and has a specific 1H-NMR spectrum. The reagents used are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, and finally aq. KOH with heat. 

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound based on the NMR data. Let's look at the NMR peaks:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupled with two neighboring protons. Wait, but an aldehyde is at the end, so maybe it's next to a CH2 group? Because a triplet would mean two neighboring protons. Or perhaps it's part of a conjugated system, like an enal.

- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. So maybe aromatic protons. If it's a doublet, perhaps they're in a para-substituted benzene ring. Like two protons on adjacent carbons, each coupled with one proton.

- 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H. Also aromatic. Could be another set of protons on a benzene ring, maybe in a para-substituted position as well.

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. Maybe it's a couple of protons that are deshielded, like in an enol form or adjacent to an oxygen. Or perhaps it's part of an ene-yne structure, but more likely, this could be a conjugated diene or something like that. Alternatively, maybe they're on adjacent carbons in a conjugated system, like a 1,2-diene, but I'm not sure.

- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. This seems like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe oxygen. So like OCH2 or something. But wait, the splitting is a doublet. So maybe the CH2 is next to another CH2 or another group with two protons. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester.

Putting this together, I'm thinking maybe the compound has an aldehyde group, two aromatic rings, and maybe some substituents. Let's think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. So the molecular weight is 12*8 +1*9 +14 +16 = 96 +9 +14 +16 = 135? Wait, maybe I should just consider the structure.

Wait, C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1
