Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what we've got here. The question involves determining the structure of a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO: so, for each degree, I know that each double bond or ring counts as one. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1.

So, plugging in: (2*8 + 2 - 9 - 0 + 1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, a benzene ring (which is three degrees), a double bond (one), and two rings or another double bond. Or maybe a benzene and some other structures.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. The triplet suggests it's coupling with two neighboring protons. So perhaps the aldehyde is next to a CH2 group?

Then, 6.98 ppm doublet, integrating 2H. That's probably part of a substituted aromatic ring, maybe para substituted. Similarly, 6.51 ppm doublet, 2H; that might be another aromatic ring. Wait, but two doublets could be from a para-substituted benzene where each pair is across from each other. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton or perhaps an enol form. But it's 2H, so maybe a conjugated diene or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a pair of protons adjacent to an electronegative group, but I'm not sure.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe it's connected to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Or perhaps it's part of an amine? But the molecular formula has an N, but the NMR doesn't show a peak around the amine region like 2-3 ppm for CH2NH or something. Hmm.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure involves a benzaldehyde group with substituents. The aldehyde (9.72 ppm) is part of a larger structure. Let me think of possible structures.

Wait, the NMR has two aromatic doublets. So perhaps the molecule has two para-substituted benzene rings. That would account for two sets of aromatic protons. For example, each benzene ring has two protons as
