Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group, right? So that means there's probably an -O-C=O group in the molecule.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's break them down.

First, two aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents affect the aromatic protons. The substituents could be in positions that lead to different splitting. For example, if the substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be two sets of two each, maybe a doublet each. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic-H. Hmm. That could mean that each substituent has a certain symmetry. Like maybe each substituent has identical protons, so they split into two groups. Or maybe the substituents are ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, di-substituted benzene rings... the substituents can be in positions that lead to different NMR signals. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring could have two equivalent protons on each substituent, leading to maybe two doublets. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the substituents are in ortho positions, perhaps the ring protons are more deshielded and split into different signals. But the NMR shows two signals for the aromatic-H, so maybe each substituent leads to a set of two equivalent protons each. So perhaps two substituents each with two protons? No, wait, each substituent wouldn't have protons necessarily. Maybe the substituents are groups like -OCH3? No, wait, but in this case, the presence of ester groups.

Wait, the substituents might be ester groups. So perhaps each substituent is an ester group. So the benzene ring has two ester substituents. But wait, an ester is an R-O-CO-O-R group? No, more accurately, it's an RCOOR' group. So if each substituent is an ester, like maybe -COOR, but that's not possible because that would
