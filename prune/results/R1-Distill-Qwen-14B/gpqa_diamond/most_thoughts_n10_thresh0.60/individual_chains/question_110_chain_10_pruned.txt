Okay, let's tackle this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Hmm, so I need to figure out for each star whether it's observable by both instruments, based on their apparent magnitudes and the telescopes' capabilities.

First, I should probably gather all the information given. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. Wait, no, wait. It says "brighter than 17 mag", but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So if the V magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's lower than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars with V mag less than or equal to 17, because if a star is brighter (lower mag), it's more detectable. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for a star to be detected by HIRES, its V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, no, wait—wait. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". Oh, wait, that's a bit confusing. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a star that's "brighter than 17" would have a magnitude less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe any star with V ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag—so V ≤16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤17 (as seen by ESPRESSO) and also ≤16 (as seen by HIRES), because both instruments must see it. Wait, wait. No, no, because HIRES can only see up to V=16, but ESPRESSO can go up to V=17. So any star with V ≤16 can be seen by both. Because if a star is 16 or brighter, HIRES can detect it, and since it's also ≤17, ESPRESSO can too. But a star with V=17 can't be seen by HIRES because HIRES only goes up to 16, but can be seen by ESPRESSO.

Wait, no. Wait
