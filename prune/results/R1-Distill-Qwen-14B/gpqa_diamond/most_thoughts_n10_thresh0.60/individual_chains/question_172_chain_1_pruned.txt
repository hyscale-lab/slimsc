Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when a star is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation.

So the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( - (E_upper - E_lower)/(k*T) ). Here, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference Î”E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number seems familiar because k (Boltzmann's constant) is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, yeah, k is 1.380649e-23 J/K. So the energy difference here is exactly k times a temperature, maybe?

The ratio of excitation levels is given as N1/N2 = 2. Let me denote star_1 as having the higher excitation, so N1 is twice N2. But wait, the problem says "iron atoms in photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So in
