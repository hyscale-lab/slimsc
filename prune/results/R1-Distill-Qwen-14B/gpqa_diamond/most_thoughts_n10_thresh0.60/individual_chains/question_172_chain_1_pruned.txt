Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of elements depend on the temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here.

The question says that iron atoms in star 1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. So the excitation level is higher in star 1. I think the Boltzmann factor is responsible for the population ratio between energy levels. The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. 

Wait, in this case, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting. So E = k * T * something.

Wait, the excitation is twice as much in star 1. So n1/n2 = 2. But wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio for star 1 over star 2 is 2. Let me denote the populations as n1 and n2 for each star.

So (n1/n2) = 2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E)/(k T1) ) / exp( - (E)/(k T2) ) 

Wait, but I think E is the energy difference. Let me make sure: the energy levels are E_i and E_j. Let's say E_i is higher than E_j by delta E. So the ratio is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this problem, perhaps E_i is the excited state, E_j is the lower state. So for each star, the ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( - delta E/(k T) )

But wait, the question is about the ratio between the two stars. So for star 1, the ratio is (n1_upper / n1_lower) = (g1/g2) * exp(-delta E/(
