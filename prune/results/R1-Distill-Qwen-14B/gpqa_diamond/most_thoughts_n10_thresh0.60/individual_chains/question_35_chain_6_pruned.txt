Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see. The problem gives me some setup and a multiple-choice question. 

First, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, like an electron but heavier) would have spin 1/2, so its components would be proportional to the Pauli matrices. 

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by a matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, right! That's the Pauli Y matrix, sigma_y. So S is sigma_y, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So Ay = c * S = (h/4π) * sigma_y. Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. 

Eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by a scalar, the eigenvalues just get scaled by that factor. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1), so ±h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly mention h/(4π) as eigenvalues. Let me check the options again.

Option A: Imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because eigenvalues of Ay should be real or imaginary? Wait, no. Wait, Ay is a Hermitian operator because it's an angular momentum component, which should be Hermitian. So the eigenvalues should be real numbers. So any option that suggests eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be wrong.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues are real. So any options stating that the eigenvalues have imaginary parts should be incorrect. Let's look again.

Option A: Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). So eigenvalues are complex? That can't be right. So option A is incorrect.
