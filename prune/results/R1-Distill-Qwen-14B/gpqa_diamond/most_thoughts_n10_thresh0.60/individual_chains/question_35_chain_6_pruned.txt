Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's equal to c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second as (i, 0). So, I should probably write down the matrix Ay first.

Let me compute Ay. Since c is h/(4π), and S is as given, then Ay should be:

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So that matrix would be:

[0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Wait, no, because when you multiply each element by c. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, because the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector.

The options are all about properties of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors. Let's think about each option.

First, let's compute the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So, the matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i*(h/(4π)))(i*(h/(4π))) ]

Calculating each part: (-a)^2 is a². The other term is [ (-i)(i) ]*(h/(4π))². Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the term is 1*(h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Therefore, a² = h²/(16 π²), so a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, let
