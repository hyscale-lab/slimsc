Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm not super confident, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

First, I should probably think about conservation laws. Since it's an annihilation process, I guess both energy and momentum are conserved. But wait, wait. The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can make some approximations.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, so its speed is much less than the speed of light. That probably means we can use non-relativistic approximations for the antiproton's energy and momentum. But wait, what about the proton? In the lab frame, the proton is at rest, I think, because it's just sitting there waiting to annihilate with the moving antiproton. Or is it? Wait, the setup says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the proton is considered stationary. Because in particle reactions, sometimes one is at rest and the other is moving.

So, if the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly (non-relativistically), we can model this situation using conservation of energy and momentum in the lab frame.

Let me think. The initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄). The proton is at rest, so its energy is just m_p c². The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately its rest energy plus (1/2) m_p̄ v². But since they're matter and antimatter, their rest masses are the same, right? So m_p = m_p̄ = m_p (like 938 MeV/c² or something, but maybe it's not needed here because perhaps the mass cancels out?).

Wait, but the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. So the mass of A is 300 MeV/c². So A is much lighter than the proton. Hmm. Wait, but the product is 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. So total mass is 4 * 300 MeV/c² = 12
