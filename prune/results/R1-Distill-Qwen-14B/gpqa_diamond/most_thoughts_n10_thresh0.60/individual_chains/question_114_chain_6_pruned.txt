Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the first reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh right, the addition of HCN to ketones. But wait, under what conditions does that happen?

Wait, I remember that for the addition of HCN to ketones, you typically use an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the formation of an enol or enolate, and an acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So NaCN is providing the cyanide ion as the nucleophile, and the acid (A) would be H3O+ or something like that. So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+.

Wait but wait, after the addition of HCN to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin. The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that out. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So yeah, that's
