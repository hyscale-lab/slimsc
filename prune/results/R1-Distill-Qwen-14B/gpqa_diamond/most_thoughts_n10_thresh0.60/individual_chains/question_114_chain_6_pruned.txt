Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see... The question is about choosing the correct reagents for two reactions. Hmm.

Alright, the first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give different combinations for A and B, so I need to figure out which ones work.

Let me start with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN typically leads me to think about a nucleophilic substitution, but wait, butanone is a ketone. In the presence of a base like NaCN, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced. Oh wait, no, NaCN is a source of CN- which is a nucleophile. Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl?

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. When a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN- in a basic condition, perhaps it's a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a condensation reaction. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think, for ketones reacting with cyanide, I think it's a nucle
