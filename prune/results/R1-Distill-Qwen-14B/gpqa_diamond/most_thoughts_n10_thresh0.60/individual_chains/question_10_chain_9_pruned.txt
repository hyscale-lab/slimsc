Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I know.

The question gives four options, a, b, c, d. Each describes a planet's characteristics. I think density is mass divided by volume. So for each option, I'll need to calculate the density.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Oh, right, Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So if this planet has the same mass and radius, its density should be same as Earth, which is about 5.5.

Option b: Planet with 2 Earth masses and density 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but density is given here. So maybe that's already a clue. But wait, does the density depend on mass? Or is it about the composition? I'm a bit confused. If a planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5, then its density is higher than Earth? Wait no, wait, Earth's density is 5.5. So this planet's density is same as Earth's. Because the question says it has a density of approximately 5.5, so that's same as Earth's. So maybe option D is one of the choices.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm, same composition implies same density, right? Because composition affects density. So if Earth's density is 5.5, this planet should have the same. But wait, wait, no. Wait, mass and radius. Let me
