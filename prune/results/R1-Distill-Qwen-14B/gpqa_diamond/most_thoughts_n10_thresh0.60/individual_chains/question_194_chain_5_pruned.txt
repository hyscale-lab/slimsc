Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So for each possible combination of S1, S2, S3, I calculate E and then sum e^{-βE}.

Wait, but each spin has two possible states, so there are 2^3 =8 possible states in total. That's manageable. Maybe I can list all the possible states and calculate E for each.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Since the system is symmetric with all spins interacting with each other, perhaps I can find the number of states with a particular value of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because the energy depends on this sum, the partition function can be grouped by the value of that sum.

Wait, let's think about the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term is the product of two spins. Since each S can be +1 or -1, each product is either +1 or -1 as well.

Wait no, because S_i * S_j is 1 if they're the same, and -1 if different. So each term S_i S_j contributes either +1 or -1.

So the sum could be 3, 1, or -1, depending on how many pairs are aligned.

Wait, let me see:

If all three spins are aligned (all +1 or all -1), then each product S_i S_j is +1. So the sum is 3. So E would be -J*(3) = -3J.

If exactly two spins are aligned and one is opposite? Wait, no. Let's think: if two spins are same and the third is opposite, how many aligned pairs do we have. Let's say S1 and S2 are +1, S3 is -1. Then S1S2 = +1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3 = -1. So sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. Wait, that's one plus two minuses: 1-1-1 = -1. So the sum is -1, E is -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no, E is -J times the sum. So in this case, sum is -1, so E is -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Let's take another example where two are same. Suppose S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. So E= -J*(-1)= J.

Wait another case: suppose two spins are opposite to the third. Like S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Then S1S2 = -1, S1S3 = -1, S2S3=+1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. So again, sum is -1, E is J.

Wait, but what if only one pair is aligned, and the others are not? For example, S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1. Then all three products are +1, sum is 3, E is -3J.

Wait, no, that's all aligned. What if only two pairs are aligned? Wait, can that happen? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps another scenario: if all three spins are the same, then all products are +1, sum 3, E=-3J. If two spins are same and third is opposite, then the sum is -1,
