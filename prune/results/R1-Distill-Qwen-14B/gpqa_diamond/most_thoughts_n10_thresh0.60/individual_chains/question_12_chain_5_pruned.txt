Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when a particle decays, energy and momentum are conserved. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The problem is Pi(+) decaying into a mu(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, right, the equation given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. And Pi(+) is at rest. So the initial momentum is zero because Pi is stationary. That means the total momentum of the products must also be zero. So the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Now, the masses given are Pi is 139.6 MeV, and mu is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino, I think, is considered massless in these kinds of problems because its mass is negligible. So the neutrino's energy would just be its momentum times c squared, right?

So, let's denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu. And their momenta as p_mu and p_nu. Since the total momentum is zero, p_mu = -p_nu. So their magnitudes are equal, p_mu = p_nu = p (let's say).

But wait, for the muon, its total energy E_mu is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. And for the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p c. Because E² = (pc)² + (mc²)², and when m=0, E = pc.

So, for conservation of energy, the initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Substituting the expressions:
(m_mu c² + K_mu) + (p c) = 139.6 MeV.

Also, since the momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, their vector sum is zero, so momentum is conserved.

But wait, the muon's momentum is p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu^2)/(c^2) - (m_mu^2 c^2) ) / c, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the conservation of energy and momentum.
