Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options given are A to D with varying pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I need to figure out the total amounts of H+ and OH- ions in the mixture.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, let's calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid. It dissociates partially, but I think for neutralization, the H+ it provides might be important. Wait, but when mixing with a strong base, perhaps I should consider the strong acid and base first.

Wait, no, maybe I should consider all H+ and OH- from all sources.

So, for each solution, calculate moles.

First solution: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH.

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when dissolved in water, it dissociates into CH3COO- and H+. So the H+ from it is not as much as a strong acid like HCl.

Second solution: 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Each mole gives one mole of H+, so that's 0.08 moles H+.

Third solution: 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH- ions. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives 2 OH-, total moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total volume of the mixture is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

Wait, but before that, perhaps I should calculate the H+ and OH- from all sources and see if there's any excess.

But wait, CH3COOH is an acid, so it contributes H+. HCl is also an acid, contributing H+. Ba(OH)2 contributes OH-.

So the total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl. The total OH- comes only from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react. So first, let's compute all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, but wait: CH3COOH is a weak acid; when we mix it with other solutions, will the dissociation change? Hmm, maybe it's better to first compute the net H+ or OH- after all reactions, considering neutralization.

So let me think: The H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH) will react with OH- (from Ba(OH)2) to form water. The excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but wait another thing: CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when mixed with a strong base, perhaps it will get neutralized to some extent, but the strong acid (HCl) will react first.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Calculate the total moles of H+ from all sources (weak and strong acids).
2. Calculate the total moles of OH- from the base.
3. Subtract the moles of OH- from the total H+ to see if there's any excess H+ or OH-.
4. If H+ > OH-, then the solution is acidic, and the excess H+ will determine the pH.
5. If OH- > H+, then the solution is basic, and the excess OH- will determine the pH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when H+ is added from HCl, which is a strong acid, it's going to contribute a lot of H+. Then the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will neutralize some of that H+.

But wait, wait, CH3COOH is an acid, so when you mix it with a base, will it react? Let me think: the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from all sources, including the H+ from CH3COOH. But wait, in solution, the H+ comes from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but the H+ from HCl is strong, so it's fully dissociated, while CH3COOH only partially dissociates. So maybe the neutralization will proceed as follows:

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will fully dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH-.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl-.

CH3COOH is a weak acid; it will only partially dissociate, but in the presence of a strong acid and base, perhaps its dissociation is suppressed, or maybe the strong acid's H+ affects the acetic acid's dissociation?

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to calculate the total H+ from all sources and total OH-, then see which is in excess.

So:

Total H+ sources:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. But since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. Hmm, but when calculating the total H+ in solution, I can't just take all 0.05 moles as H+ because it's weak. But wait, when we have other H+ sources, like from HCl, will the CH3COOH dissociate more or less? Because in a solution with high H+, the dissociation of CH3COOH will be suppressed (Le Chatelier's principle). So perhaps the contribution of H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl, especially since HCl is a strong acid.

Wait, but when mixing, perhaps the initial [H+] is from HCl, and the CH3COOH contributes some more. But in reality, the HCl will provide 0.08 moles H+ in 1.2 L, which is a concentration of 0.08 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0667 M. That's a pH of around 1.18 (since pH = -log(0.0667) ≈ 1.18). But the presence of CH3COOH would contribute a little more H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is to calculate the net moles of H+ and OH-.

So:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total H+ from CH3COOH: Let's say, approximately, the same as the moles of CH3COOH, but since it's a weak acid, it's less than that. Alternatively, perhaps when considering neutralization, the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and see if one is in excess.

So:

Total H+:

From HCl: 0.08 mol.

From CH3COOH: but since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all of its H+. But how much? Let me think: the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M. The dissociation of CH3COOH can be calculated using the Ka value. The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5.

But wait, when you add a strong acid like HCl, it will increase the H+ concentration in solution, which will suppress the dissociation of acetic acid. So the contribution of H+ from acetic acid may be less.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, since the HCl is a strong acid, the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl. So perhaps I can ignore it when calculating the total H+.

So, let's approximate:

Total H+ = 0.08 mol.

Total OH-: from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So, the reaction between H+ and OH- is:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ = 0.08, moles of OH- = 0.18.

So, OH- is in excess. The excess is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

This excess OH- will determine the pH of the solution.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.10 mol / 1.2 L = 0.0833 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0833) ≈ 1.08.

pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. The options are A) 12.62, B)1.38, C)8.92, D)8.68.

Hmm, that's a problem. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't ignore the H+ from CH3COOH. Let's recalculate that.

So, let me think again.

Total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

Total OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So, H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: Let's calculate it.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so its dissociation is:

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-.

The initial concentration of CH3COOH is 0.1 M in 0.5 L, so 0.05 mol.

But when mixed with other solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L, so the concentration becomes 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

But wait, the presence of H+ from HCl will affect the dissociation of acetic acid. So the total H+ from CH3COOH will be less than its initial concentration because H+ is already high.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the H+ contributed by CH3COOH using the Ka expression.

Ka = [H+][CH3COO^-] / [CH3COOH] = 1.8e-5.

Let me denote the concentration of H+ from CH3COOH as x.

But in solution, the total H+ from all sources is 0.08 (from HCl) plus x (from CH3COOH), but if x is much smaller than 0.08, then x can be ignored. So perhaps the contribution from CH3COOH is negligible. But let's see.

Wait, but if the solution is made by mixing all three, the initial H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, no, the way to think about this is: when all three solutions are mixed, the acetic acid is present along with HCl, which is a much stronger acid. So, the H+ from acetic acid is negligible compared to HCl.

So, perhaps the initial calculation was correct, and the excess OH- is 0.10 mol, leading to a pH of ~12.92, but that's not an option. So maybe I messed up the initial calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. But it's a weak acid, so H+ from it is less than 0.05 mol.

So, H+ total from HCl and CH3COOH: 0.08 + (some x < 0.05).

But when I mix all three, the total volume is 1200 mL (1.2 L).

Hmm, perhaps the error is in assuming that all of the OH- from Ba(OH)2 reacts with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but the OH- is 0.18 mol, and H+ is 0.08 + x (x <0.05). So, 0.13 < H+ + x < 0.13.

So, OH- is 0.18, which is more than 0.13, so the excess OH- is 0.05 mol.

Wait, no. Wait, if H+ is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13, then OH- is 0.18. So, 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 mol excess OH-.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Ah, that's option A.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible. So perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me think again. The H+ from CH3COOH is not negligible. Because when we mix it with HCl, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, but CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, which is about half. So perhaps it's better to include it.

Wait, but let's calculate the total H+ available.

HCl gives 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH, being a weak acid, might contribute some H+. Let's calculate it.

The initial concentration of CH3COOH after mixing is (0.05 mol) / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

In solution, the H+ from CH3COOH can be calculated using the Ka expression.

Ka = 1.8e-5 = [H+][CH3COO^-]/[CH3COOH].

Assuming that the dissociation of CH3COOH is x, then:

Ka = x^2 / (0.0417 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.0417 (since x is small).

So x^2 ≈ 1.8e-5 * 0.0417 ≈ 7.506e-7.

x ≈ sqrt(7.506e-7) ≈ 2.74e-4 M.

So, the H+ from CH3COOH is approximately 2.74e-4 M.

But the total volume is 1.2 L, so moles of H+ from CH3COOH is 2.74e-4 * 1.2 ≈ 3.29e-4 mol. Hmm, that's much less than 0.05 mol. So, the H+ from CH3COOH is about 0.000329 mol, which is negligible compared to the 0.08 mol from HCl.

So, the total H+ is approximately 0.08 mol.

So, when reacting with OH-:

Total OH- is 0.18 mol.

H+ is 0.08 mol.

Excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Concentration of OH- is 0.10 / 1.2 = 0.0833 M.

pOH = -log(0.0833) ≈ 1.08.

pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92. But that's still not matching any option.

Wait, but earlier when I considered H+ from CH3COOH as 0.05 mol, I got excess OH- as 0.05 mol, leading to a pH of 12.62 (option A).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in that initial assumption. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I should not ignore the H+ from CH3COOH. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH. The total OH- is from Ba(OH)2. The reaction between H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, and the excess will determine the pH.

So:

Total H+ = (HCl H+ ) + (CH3COOH H+ )

Total OH- = (Ba(OH)2 OH- )

So, let's compute each.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. But how much H+ does it release?

The H+ from CH3COOH can be found using the dissociation:

Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA]

But in this solution, the H+ is coming from both HCl and CH3COOH. The HCl provides a high concentration of H+ which suppresses the dissociation of CH3COOH.

So, the [H+] in the solution is dominated by HCl, which is 0.08 mol in 1.2 L, so [H+] from HCl is 0.08 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0667 M.

The CH3COOH will dissociate a little, but the presence of H+ from HCl will shift the equilibrium.

So, the initial [H+] is 0.0667 M.

For CH3COOH, the dissociation can be modeled by:

Ka = ( [H+] + x ) * x / ( [CH3COOH] - x )

But since x is small compared to [H+], we can approximate [H+] as 0.0667 + x ≈ 0.0667.

So,

Ka ≈ (0.0667) * x / (0.0417)

Wait, wait, [CH3COOH] after mixing is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

So,

1.8e-5 ≈ (0.0667) * x / 0.0417

Solving for x:

x ≈ (1.8e-5 * 0.0417) / 0.0667 ≈ (7.506e-7) / 0.0667 ≈ 1.125e-5 M.

So, the H+ from CH3COOH is about 1.125e-5 M, which is 1.125e-5 * 1.2 L = 1.35e-5 mol. That's negligible compared to the 0.08 mol from HCl.

So, the total H+ is approximately 0.08 + 1.35e-5 ≈ 0.0800135 mol. So, about 0.08 mol.

Now, the OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, the H+ and OH- will react:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Moles of H+ available: 0.08.
Moles of OH- available: 0.18.

The OH- is in excess by 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.10 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0833 M.

pOH = -log(0.0833) ≈ 1.08.

pH = 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

Hmm, but again, this doesn't match any of the options. The closest option is A) 12.62.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again. Maybe the H+ from CH3COOH isn't negligible, and I should include it.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in considering that the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible, but the OH- from Ba(OH)2 might neutralize some of it, leading to a different excess.

Wait, let me approach this from another angle. Let's compute the total H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and the total OH- from Ba(OH)2, then see which is in excess.

Total H+ = 0.08 (from HCl) + (H+ from CH3COOH).

H+ from CH3COOH: as calculated earlier, approximately 1.125e-5 mol, which is negligible. So total H+ ≈ 0.08 mol.

Total OH- = 0.18 mol.

So, OH- is in excess by 0.10 mol.

pH = 14 - pOH.

pOH = -log(0.0833) ≈ 1.08.

pH ≈ 12.92. But none of the options match this.

Wait, but the options are A) 12.62, which is a lower pH than 12.92. Hmm.

Perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Let me recompute the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 mol OH-.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.

Wait, but when combining all, the volume is 1.2 L, so the concentrations are:

HCl: 0.08 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0667 M H+.

CH3COOH: 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol OH- / 1.2 L = 0.15 M OH-.

Wait, but how does the reaction proceed?

Wait, perhaps the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. So, first, the OH- reacts with H+ from HCl, then any remaining OH- reacts with H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, but is that correct?

Alternatively, the OH- will react with all available H+ from all sources.

Wait, the total H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, from CH3COOH is 0.05 mol (but only a small fraction dissociates). But perhaps for a more accurate calculation, I should consider the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the net H+ and OH- after any possible neutralization.

Wait, the initial moles are:

H+ (HCl) = 0.08 mol.

H+ (CH3COOH) = let's say approximately 0.0000135 mol (as calculated earlier), which is negligible.

OH- (Ba(OH)2) = 0.18 mol.

So, the OH- will react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

Total H+ = 0.08 + (x, where x is negligible) ≈ 0.08.

So, OH- (0.18) reacts with H+ (0.08), leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH- in solution.

So, [OH-] = 0.10 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0833 M.

pOH = 1.08; pH = 12.92.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I've miscalculated the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps I should not neglect the H+ from CH3COOH. Let me compute it accurately.

The [CH3COOH] after mixing is 0.0417 M.

Ka = 1.8e-5 = [H+][A-]/[HA]

But since the solution is weakly acidic, and the H+ from HCl is 0.0667 M, which is much higher than what CH3COOH would contribute on its own.

So, the H+ from CH3COOH can be found using the approximation:

Ka = ( [H+]_total ) * x / ( [HA] - x )

But [H+]_total is approximately [H+] from HCl plus x, which is 0.0667 + x.

Since x is much smaller than 0.0667, [H+] ≈ 0.0667.

So,

1.8e-5 = (0.0667) * x / (0.0417 - x )

Assuming x is small, denominator ≈ 0.0417.

So,

x ≈ (1.8e-5 * 0.0417) / 0.0667 ≈ (7.506e-7) / 0.0667 ≈ 1.125e-5 M.

So, moles of H+ from CH3COOH is 1.125e-5 * 1.2 L ≈ 1.35e-5 mol.

So, the total H+ is 0.08 + 1.35e-5 ≈ 0.0800135 mol.

The OH- is 0.18 mol.

So, OH- in excess is 0.18 - 0.0800135 ≈ 0.0999865 mol.

Which is approximately 0.10 mol.

So, [OH-] = 0.10 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0833 M.

pOH = -log(0.0833) ≈ 1.08 → pH ≈ 12.92.

But again, not matching any option.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something else. Let me check the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: when Ba(OH)2 is added, it reacts with HCl first, and any remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is in two steps.

First, HCl (H+) reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Then, any remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

Let me try that.

So, moles of H+ (HCl) = 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- = 0.18 mol.

They react in a 1:1 ratio.

So, after reaction, 0.08 mol H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so OH- will deprotonate it.

Each mole of OH- can neutralize one mole of H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol available.

So, the 0.10 mol OH- will react with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol water and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

Wait, no. Let me think: each OH- can take an H+ from CH3COOH. So, OH- (0.10) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05). So, all CH3COOH is neutralized, and the remaining OH- is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So, after all reactions, the excess OH- is 0.05 mol.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Ah, that's option A.

So, perhaps this is the correct approach.

Wait, so the initial approach didn't consider that the CH3COOH can also react with the excess OH- after the HCl is neutralized.

So, the correct method is:

1. HCl (H+) reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2: neutralizes 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.10 mol OH-.

2. The remaining 0.10 mol OH- reacts with CH3COOH. CH3COOH has 0.05 mol available. So, all 0.05 mol CH3COOH is neutralized, and 0.05 mol OH- remains.

3. The total excess OH- is 0.05 mol.

So, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

pOH = 1.38 → pH = 12.62, which is option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given solutions:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **HCl (strong acid):**  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since HCl fully dissociates, it contributes \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
   CH₃COOH partially dissociates, contributing a small amount of H⁺. However, the H⁺ from CH₃COOH is negligible compared to the strong acid HCl due to the high H⁺ concentration from HCl.

3. **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Each Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions, so total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction
The OH⁻ ions react with the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH:
1. **Reaction of OH⁻ with H⁺ from HCl:**  
   \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ + 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \to 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
   After this reaction, \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) remains.

2. **Reaction of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH:**  
   The remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH. CH₃COOH has \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \) available, so all of it is neutralized, leaving \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \) in excess.

### Step 3: Calculate [OH⁻] and pH
The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
The concentration of excess OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
\]

The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **12.62**, which corresponds to **Option A**.  
**Answer: A**
