Okay, so I need to figure out which reaction sequence will lead to the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about the target molecule. It's a phenyl group substituted with a nitro group and a bromo group, and attached to an ethan-1-one group, which is an acetophenone-like structure.

So, benzene rings are usually substituted through electrophilic substitution reactions. The substituents direct incoming groups to certain positions. Nitro groups are strong meta directors, and bromine is also a meta director when it's already on the ring. Since the nitro group is at position 5 and bromo at position 3, that suggests that the substituents are arranged in a way where nitro is, say, in the para position relative to another substituent. Wait, no, maybe I should draw the structure.

Let me imagine the benzene ring. The ethan-1-one group is at position 1. Then, the nitro group is at position 5, and bromo at position 3. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, that makes it 1,3,5-trisubstituted. Oh wait, no, because ethan-1-one is like a ketone attached at position 1, so the other substituents are at 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2). So the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3, and 5. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the numbering is such that the ketone is at the first position, and the other two substituents are at 3 and 5.

Now, to build this molecule step by step, starting from benzene. The first step is to introduce one substituent. Let's think about the order. The presence of nitro groups and bromine suggests that the substituents are introduced in a way that each directs the next group appropriately.

Wait, nitro groups are meta-directing, and once introduced, they will direct incoming groups to meta positions. But if you have a nitro group, any subsequent substituents will go meta to it. Similarly, bromine is also meta-directing, but it's usually introduced via an electrophilic substitution, perhaps from a halogen
