Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see, the options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D.

Wait, the question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So I should probably look at each option's mass and radius to compute the density.

Let me break down each option:

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So Earth's density is around 5.5 g/cm³. That's a known fact. So option a would have a density of 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, the question says the density is about 5.5, so that's given. So the density here is 5.5. But wait, Earth's density is also 5.5. So this planet's density is same as Earth's, but it's more massive. But wait, does that mean it's more dense? Wait, no, because density is mass/volume. If it's more massive but same density, then the volume must be bigger.

Wait, maybe I should compute the density for each. Alternatively, maybe some of these can be compared without calculations.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Earth's mass is M. So this planet has 5M. But since it's same composition, density would be same as Earth's, right? Because density depends on material composition. So Earth is about 5.5 g/cm³, so this planet would also have same density. But wait, wait, if the planet is more massive but same density, same composition, then its radius would be larger. Because volume scales with radius cubed. So the mass is 5 times, and since density is same, volume is 5 times. Volume is (4/3)π r³. So if volume is 5 times, r would be cube root of 5 * Earth's radius. So larger than Earth. But the question is about density, which is same as Earth. So its density is same as Earth's, so 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same as before, same density. Because it's same composition, so density remains same. So density is 5.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For options b, c, d, the
