Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take some wrong turns, but I'll try to figure it out.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its molecular formula and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a series of reactions. The compound has the formula C8H9NO. The reagents used are sodium nitrite and HCl, followed by water, and then aqueous KOH and heat. The options given are four different aldehydes or similar structures.

First, I need to figure out what the initial structure is. Let's look at the NMR data to get some clues.

The 1H NMR data provided is:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Let me think about each peak. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet, which suggests an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group (CHO).

Looking at the next set of peaks. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm regions are doublets, each integrating for 2H. These are likely aromatic protons. The fact that they are doublets suggests they are adjacent to substituents. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, you might see doublets. Alternatively, maybe they're part of a conjugated system.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad signals sometimes indicate exchange with protons that are not in a fixed environment, like OH groups. But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure.

Degrees of unsaturation calculation: Degrees of unsat. = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1.

So, (2*8 + 2 -9 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 = 5 degrees. That's five degrees: maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond or ring (another maybe from the aldehyde), and another from maybe an ester or something else.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. The aldehyde would contribute one of the double bonds. The molecular formula might suggest a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons at 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are likely from two para-substituted benzene rings. Wait, but each is a doublet with 2H, so maybe each is part of a benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the compound has two aromatic rings attached. Because the aldehyde is at 9.72, maybe the compound is a diary
