Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's an electron in the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. Then, I need to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix representation is given by Aij. The elements Aij are hbar/2 when i is different from j, and zero otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. So first, I think I should normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Let me compute the norm of this state.

The inner product of |alpha> with itself would be |1+i|^2 for the |up> component and |2-i|^2 for the |down> component, since the states are orthonormal.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1+1=2.

Similarly, |2-i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Wait, but I might not need the normalized state for the probabilities because the probabilities would be the squared magnitudes of the coefficients divided by the norm. Or, wait, the state is already given as proportional, so maybe I should compute probabilities before normalization? Let me think.

Wait, no. If the state is proportional, then the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients multiplied by the normalization factor. So first, I need to find the probabilities for |up> and |down> in the state |alpha> after normalization.

Actually, the state is given as proportional, so perhaps the probabilities are the squared magnitudes of the coefficients divided by the sum of squares of their magnitudes. So for |up>, the coefficient is (1+i), so |1+i|^2 is 2. For |down>, it's (2-i), so |2-i|^2 is 5. So the total is 7. So the probabilities are 2/7 and 5/7, respectively. Wait, that's when the state is normalized. Because |alpha> is proportional, the actual probabilities would be (2/7) and (5/7) for |up> and |down>.

Wait, but wait. The state |alpha> is proportional to that combination, so when normalized, the probabilities are 2/7 and 5/7. So that's the first part? Or is the question about the probabilities of the eigenstates of another operator, not the z-projection?

Oh, wait, no. The first part is to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A whose matrix is
