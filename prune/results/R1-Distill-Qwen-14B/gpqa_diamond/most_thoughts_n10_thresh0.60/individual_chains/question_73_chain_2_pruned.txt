Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, the question states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with relativistic velocities, we can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh right, I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the numbers. So v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So substituting these in: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Calculating numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (0.1c)/0.7 = approximately 0.1428c. So that's about 0.14c when rounded. Oh wait, looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma*m*c². So I need to calculate the energy for each and sum them.

First, calculate gamma for each. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
v=0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 =0.64. Square root is 0.8, so gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m * c² * 2m? Wait wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the mass is 2m. So E1 = gamma * (2m) * c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, no
