Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The question says two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The problem asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the velocities. Oh right, because you can't just do v_rel = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. That's the classical approach, but at relativistic speeds, we have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Let me make sure I get that right. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's the speed of B?

Wait, no. Wait, the way the question is phrased, both are moving in the positive x-direction. So if I'm in one frame, say the rest frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's the speed of B?

Wait, no, the relative speed is the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So A is moving at 0.6c; B is at 0.5c. So from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Calculating numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative velocity is (-0.1c)/0.7 = -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, but the question probably just wants the magnitude. So about 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Next, the total energy of the system. Hmm, I think I need to calculate the rest mass energies plus their kinetic energies, right? Or wait, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of their individual relativistic energies.

Each astronaut's energy is given by gamma * m c². So for each, compute gamma and multiply by their mass and c².

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) ) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = gamma2 *3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me calculate that more
