Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully again.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They want to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, I remember that blackbody radiation peak wavelength depends on the temperature. The peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same too. Because if λ_max is the same, T must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature.

If both stars have the same temperature, then the luminosity would depend on their radius and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So since both have the same T, L is proportional to R².

Wait, Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Then L1 would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25 times L2. So the factor would be 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1's radial velocity is 0, Star_2's is 700 km/s. Does that affect anything? Oh, radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But when we calculate luminosities based on observed brightness, which depends on the intrinsic luminosity and the distance. Oh, but in this problem, the question is about the computed luminosity based on their properties, not observed brightness. Or wait, the problem says they computed the luminosity using blackbody radiation, so the velocities might not directly affect the computation. Unless the velocities are used to find the actual temperatures, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same, implying same T.

Wait, but if the stars are moving, does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh,
