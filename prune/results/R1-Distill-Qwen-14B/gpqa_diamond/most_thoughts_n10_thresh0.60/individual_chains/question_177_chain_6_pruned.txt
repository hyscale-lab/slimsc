Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength depends on the temperature of the star—so that means both stars have the same temperature? Because a black body's peak wavelength is given by Wien's law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, but wait, how does radial velocity affect luminosity? Oh wait, luminosity is intrinsic brightness, and it's calculated based on the star's properties. Radial velocity might be a red herring here, or maybe it's used for something else, like Doppler shift. But the problem says that the luminosities were computed assuming they radiate as black bodies. So maybe the radial velocities don't directly affect the luminosity calculation. Or perhaps they are used to find some other parameter, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, luminosity for a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both stars have the same T (because their peak wavelengths are the same), I can compare their luminosities based on their radii.

Wait, the problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.

So L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, that ratio simplifies to (R1/R2)². Because R1 is
