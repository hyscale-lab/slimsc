Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when atoms are in a photosphere, especially under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation levels are related to temperature. Oh right, LTE means that the gas in that region behaves according to the laws of thermodynamics, so the excitation states of atoms can be described by the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, twice as excited in a specific energy level. So the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one is double for star_1 compared to star_2. 

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. 

In this case, it's the same iron atoms, so the statistical weights g_i and g_j might be the same if we're comparing the same energy levels. Or wait, maybe the specific energy levels have different g factors? But the question says the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Hmm, well, if we can assume that the statistical weights are the same for both stars when comparing the same energy levels, then they cancel out. So the ratio n_i/n_j would be exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

Wait, the ratio is n1/n2 for the same level. Oh no, wait, no. In the problem, for each star, the iron atoms in a specific energy level have a certain excitation. But the ratio of excitation between the two stars is given. Specifically, star_1's level is twice as excited as star_2's. So perhaps for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level to a lower one is given as 2 for star_1 and perhaps something else for star_2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me re-read the question. Oh, wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Oh wait, does that mean that in star_1, the
