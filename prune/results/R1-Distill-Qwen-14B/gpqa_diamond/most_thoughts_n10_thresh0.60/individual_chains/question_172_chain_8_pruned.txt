Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science problem about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between these levels is 1.38e-23 J. Both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of populations in two energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of particles in state 2 to state 1 is equal to e^(-ΔE/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. Let me denote the energy levels as E_high and E_low, where E_high is the higher energy level. So, the number of atoms in E_high relative to E_low would be given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me define n1 as the number of atoms in E_high for star_1, and n2 for star_2. But wait, actually, the problem says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So, I think the ratio n1/(n1 + n2) isn't directly involved. Maybe it's the ratio of the populations in the two energy levels.

Wait, the question says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote that ΔE = E_high - E_low = 1.38e-23 J.

In star 1, the population in E_high is twice as much as in star 2's E_high? Or is it that in star 1, the ratio of E_high to E_low is twice that of star 2? Hmm, the wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2."

Wait, perhaps it means that the excitation (the population) is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2 for the same energy level. So, for example, n1_high = 2 * n2_high. Or maybe n1_high
