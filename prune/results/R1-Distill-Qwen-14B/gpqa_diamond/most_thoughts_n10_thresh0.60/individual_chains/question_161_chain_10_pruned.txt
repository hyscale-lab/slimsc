Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup: Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He's connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, aiming to have almost no gas molecules around. But despite that, some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path as λ1 based on factors like volume, pressure, and temperature.

Wait, mean free path... I remember that's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula I think is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), or something like that. Oh wait, more accurately, the mean free path depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. Oh right, the formula is λ = (1) / (n * π * d² / 2), but I might be mixing up the exact terms here. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and P is pressure. So higher pressure would mean shorter mean free path, since more molecules are around to collide.

But then, Mike starts the electron beam and notices that the mean free path changes. It's no longer λ1 but λ2. Why would that be?

Wait, the electron beam is being used. So when the electrons are moving through the vacuum chamber, they interact with the gas molecules. The gas molecules are moving around, and when the electrons come in, the gas molecules scatter the electrons. But how does that affect the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves?

Hmm, maybe it's about electron scattering causing more collisions. Or perhaps it's about the gas molecules getting ionized or excited, which changes their behavior. Wait, but the question says that the mean free path of the gas molecules is now λ2, not λ1. So, what's causing this change?

Wait, when the electrons are moving through the gas, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by the electrons. This could cause the gas molecules to undergo more collisions. But wait, the mean free path is about the gas molecules colliding with each other,
