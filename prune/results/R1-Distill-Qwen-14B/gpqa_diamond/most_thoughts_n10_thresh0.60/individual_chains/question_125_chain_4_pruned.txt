Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in quantum mechanics, the three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator is a standard problem. It's often treated in spherical coordinates because of the symmetry.

The question asks about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to that energy. Hmm, right. So I need to find both the energy value and the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions) for that state.

Wait, what's the third excited state? Well, in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is the first state, n=0. The first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, so the third excited state would be n=3. Wait, no, wait—no, wait. Wait, the terminology can sometimes be confusing. Let me clarify: the ground state is the lowest energy, so the first excited state is the next one up. So ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1 (if n is the principal quantum number), second is n=2, third is n=3. So third excited state is n=3.

But wait, in the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh right, because the potential is isotropic, the energy depends on the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the quantum numbers in x, y, z directions. Alternatively, in spherical coordinates, the energy is determined by the principal quantum number n, which would be n = 2l + something? Wait no, another approach.

Wait, the 3D harmonic oscillator can be considered as three independent 1D harmonic oscillators, each in x, y, z directions. So the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction. The energy for each 1D oscillator is (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction (n_x, n_y, n_z). So the total energy is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, the principal quantum number n in 3D is the sum n = n_x + n_y +
