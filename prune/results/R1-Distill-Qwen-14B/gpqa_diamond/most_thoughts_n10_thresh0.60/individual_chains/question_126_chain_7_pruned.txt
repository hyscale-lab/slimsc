Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about two reactions and the products formed. Then, these products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. We need to determine how many peaks they observe in each case.

First, let me break down what each reaction is doing.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Let me draw that. Hexan-3-one means a 6-carbon chain with a ketone group on C3. The fifth carbon has a methoxy group attached.

So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-something? Wait, no. Let's number the chain.

Hexan-3-one: positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So carbonyl is on C3. So structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one would be:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So the ketone is on C3, which is the third carbon. The fifth carbon is CH(OCH3), but wait, let's see. 

Actually, the structure is:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is:

Carbon chain: 1 2 3 4 5 6

So carbonyl on C3. So it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon.

Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be:

At position 5, a methoxy substituent. So the structure is:

CH2CH
