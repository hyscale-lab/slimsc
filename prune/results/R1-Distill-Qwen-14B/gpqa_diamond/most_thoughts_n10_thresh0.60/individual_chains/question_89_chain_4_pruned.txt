Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on my adamantane structures, but I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon, very rigid with multiple rings. The 1,3-dibromo probably means there are two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it usually causes an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So, I think this is an E2 mechanism here. The product would be a diene, but wait, in this case, since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Wait, no, the two bromines are on 1 and 3. So elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 2 and 3? No, wait, no, because each elimination removes two substituents from adjacent carbons. So if the structure is Br-C-C-Br, eliminating H and Br from each adjacent C would form a double bond between those two Cs. So the product would be a mono-ene, because we have two Brs on adjacent carbons. So elimination would give a trans double bond. So the product is 1,3-diene or perhaps in adamantane, the structure after elimination would be an adamantane with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure becomes a bicyclic compound with a double bond.

But the product is a light yellow solid, which is typical for alkenes but more importantly, the IR spectrum shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, 1720 is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Oh, so maybe the product isn't an alkene. Hmm, that's conflicting. Because elimination would form an alkene, but maybe I'm wrong here.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. But with two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution. KOH could cause a nucleophilic substitution, but with two bromines, maybe it's a double SN2? But that's less likely because SN2 requires a good leaving group and a suitable structure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but wait, that gives alkenes, but then why the IR peak for carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the first reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, forming a diene, but then some further reaction. But the IR is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester or maybe an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization or some kind of ring formation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, wait, another possibility: the product could be an epoxide. But would KOH form an epoxide? No, epoxidation usually uses peracids. So perhaps it's a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction is elimination of HBr twice, forming a conjugated diene, but that might not directly give a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is treated with KOH in a way that forms a ketone.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double elimination, but perhaps it's forming an enol which then tautomerizes. Or maybe it's forming a cyclopropane via some kind of elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the IR. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong indication of a carbonyl group. So the product after KOH must have a carbonyl. So maybe the first reaction is a substitution to form a ketone.

Wait, but how? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that would form a diol. But diol's IR doesn't have a strong peak at 1720. Alternatively, maybe one Br is replaced by OH, and the other undergoes elimination. Wait, that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that elimination occurs, forming a carbonyl. Like, if the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, considering the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me think of the structure. Adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings in a diamond-like structure. If the bromines are on adjacent carbons, perhaps when KOH is added, it abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to each Br, leading to the formation of a
