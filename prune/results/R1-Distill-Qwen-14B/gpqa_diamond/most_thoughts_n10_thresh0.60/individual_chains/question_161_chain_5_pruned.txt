Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let's read through it again.

Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, less than 1e-9 Torr. His goal is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron microscopy by scattering the electrons. But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there.

Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. That's the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. He does this using factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes to λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't change things. So why is λ2 different from λ1?

Hmm, I remember that the mean free path depends on several factors. The main formula I think is λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density of the gas molecules and σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another formula involves pressure, volume, and temperature: λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * P), where d is the diameter of the molecules. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, wait, another approach. The mean free path in a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure. Because lower pressure means fewer molecules, so on average, they have to travel further before hitting another molecule. So if the pressure is the same, the mean free path shouldn't change. But in this scenario, Mike's setup changes when the electron beam is on.

Oh, right! The electron beam is introducing energy into the system. When the beam hits the gas molecules, it can cause scattering. But wait, how does that affect the mean free path? Well, when the electron beam is active, the gas molecules get bombarded by electrons. Each collision with the electron beam would change the gas molecules' motion, perhaps ionizing them or causing them to move more. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam is causing the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature is the same, so that's not it.

Wait, another thought: the presence of the electron beam might cause the gas to be ionized. Ionized gas molecules have a different behavior. They might have different cross-sections for scattering each other. Or, since they're charged,
