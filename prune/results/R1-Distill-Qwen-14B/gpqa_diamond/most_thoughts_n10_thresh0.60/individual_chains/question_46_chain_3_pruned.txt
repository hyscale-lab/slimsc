Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it. The question is about what happens when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let's see.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis. Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on a double bond are rearranged. It's like breaking and reforming the double bonds. Grubbs catalyst typically induces ring-closing metathesis or ring-opening, but in this case, the starting material is an alkene, so I think it's more about breaking it and forming new alkenes.

The starting compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene would have the double bond starting at carbon 1. So, structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons properly.

Pent means five carbons. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the main chain is five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, wait. Let me number the carbons. Carbon 1 is the first carbon, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the rest would be C3, C4, C5. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would make it pentene with a methyl branch on C3. Hmm, but maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2-CH2? No, wait.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, that can't be because pent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3 if it were 1-pentene. But with a methyl branch on the third carbon, so 3-methyl.

Wait, let's write it step by step.

The formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2
