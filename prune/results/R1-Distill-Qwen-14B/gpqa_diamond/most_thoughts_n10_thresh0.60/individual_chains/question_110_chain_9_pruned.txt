Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. The key is to figure out which stars are bright enough for both instruments. Wait, I remember that the brightness as observed from Earth (apparent magnitude) is what matters here, not the absolute magnitude. Oh right, because absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at a standard distance, but actual brightness depends on distance and other factors.

The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So stars with V < 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So stars with V < 16 can be detected by HIRES. Wait, no: the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, meaning less than 17. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if a star is magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16, so magnitude less than 16.

Wait, the exact wording: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter
