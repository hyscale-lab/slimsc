Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and going through several transformations. The final product is product 4, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on it. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

First, let me sketch out each step to visualize what's happening.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that ketones can undergo various reactions with bromine. Oh wait, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When ketones react with Br2, I think it's a halogenation reaction. Oh right, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are more reactive. So, cyclohexanone would undergo an addition of bromine at the alpha position. But wait, wait, maybe it's an enolate formation? Or is it an electrophilic addition?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. Or wait, no, that's when you have a double bond. Oh wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. So when you treat it with bromine, maybe it undergoes a halogen addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihalide addition. Wait, I think I'm
