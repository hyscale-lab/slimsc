Okay, I've got this question about stars and the energy levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. So the question is about comparing two stars, star_1 and star_2.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, the excitation here refers to the number of atoms in an excited state relative to the ground state or another lower energy level. So the ratio of the populations is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2 for this energy level.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The formula I remember is n_upper/n_lower = exp( -Î”E/(k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. For each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or another level) depends on the temperature. So for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1, perhaps? Or wait, no. Let me read the question again.

It says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So if the ratio for star_1 is, say, n1_upper/n1_lower = 2, and for star_2, that ratio is n2_upper/n2_lower = 1. Because if star_1's excited level is twice as populated as star_2's, but wait wait, the exact wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe the ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio for star_1 is higher than star_2 by a factor of two. So maybe n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower). Like, star_1's ratio is twice that of star_2's.

Wait, let me think again. The question says that in star_1, the excited level has twice the number
