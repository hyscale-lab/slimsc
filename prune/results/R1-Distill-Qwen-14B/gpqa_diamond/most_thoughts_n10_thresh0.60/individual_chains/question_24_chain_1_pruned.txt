Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving mixtures X, Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. The goal is to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A) 16, B) 18, C) 22, D) 12.

Alright, let's break down the information given.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of double or triple bonds because alkenes and alkynes can react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. So, mixture X likely contains alkenes or alkynes.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The problem states that this is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, in this case, one of the components in X must be undergoing disproportionation.

The resulting mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that Y doesn't have any double or triple bonds, maybe because they were hydrogenated. But wait, the next part says that when X and Y are hydrogenated, they both give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a solvent, probably something like hexane or something similar.

Wait, so both X and Y, when hydrogenated with severe conditions, give Z. That means Z is the fully saturated version of whatever was in X and Y. But Y comes from X via a reaction with platinum under heat. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the hydrogenation part. If X is hydrogenated under severe conditions, it gives Z. Similarly, Y when hydrogenated gives Z. So, perhaps X and Y are unsaturated, and Z is the fully saturated product. But wait, Y doesn't have any double bonds because it doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, maybe Y has rings or something else.

Wait, but the problem says that mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So Y has no double or triple bonds left. Therefore, mixture Y must have had all
