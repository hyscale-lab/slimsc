Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectral data. Let me start by analyzing the information step by step.

First, the FTIR data. There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in carboxylic acids. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So that makes sense because a carboxylic acid has both an O-H and a C=O group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds in the compound, so the structure must be entirely saturated. So any options with double bonds can be eliminated, but looking at the given options, I don't see any with obvious double bonds. So that point is probably just a hint to rule out other possibilities not listed.

Now, the NMR details. The signals are a bit complex. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me think about splitting patterns. Each splitting comes from neighboring protons.

Let's consider the structure of the compounds. All the options have a COOH group, so the -COOH is present. The rest of the structure varies in the branching around the central carbons.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, the structures are all similar. Let me write them out more clearly.

Option D: CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH
So, the structure is COOH attached to a chain that's CH3-CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3). Wait, is that correct? Let me parse it. It's CH3CH2 (ethyl group) connected to a carbon that has a CH3 and another group, then another carbon which also has a CH3 and another group, then COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the central part. For instance, in option D, the central two carbons (the ones attached to COOH) would each have a CH3 and an ethyl group? Or wait, no, let me look again.

Wait, for option D: structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, each of the two central carbons (the ones next to each other) has a CH3 substituent and a CH2CH3 substituent. Or wait, no: each central carbon is connected to a CH3 and to another group. Let me
