Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a boson X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

First, I remember that in particle physics, the decay of a boson into fermions depends on the mass of the fermions. The boson can decay into a pair of fermions if the sum of their rest masses is less than the mass of the boson. Oh wait, right, the threshold condition is that the fermion mass should be less than half the boson's mass because each fermion gets some energy, but in the rest frame, each would have energy at least their rest mass.

So, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay product must have a mass less than 3 GeV because 6/2 is 3. Let me list the known fermion masses. 

Quarks: The up, down, strange, and charm quarks have masses. Up and down are like a few MeV, strange maybe around 100 MeV, and charm is about 1.5 GeV. Oh wait, charm is about 1.2-1.5 GeV roughly. Then the bottom quark is about 4.5-5 GeV. Top quark is way heavier, around 173 GeV, so that's way above 3 GeV. 

Leptons: Electrons are almost massless, muons about 0.1 GeV, taus around 1.78 GeV. So let's see.

So, looking at possible fermion pairs:

For quarks, any quark pair where each quark has mass less than 3 GeV. Let's list quarks:

- u, d: masses are very low, so definitely allowed. So uū and dđ.
- s: about 100 MeV, so sī is allowed.
- c: about 1.2 GeV, so cē is allowed because 1.2 < 3.
- b: about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3, so bī not allowed.
- t: way too heavy, so tī not allowed.

For leptons:

- e: negligible, so ee is allowed.
- μ: 0.1 GeV, so μμ allowed.
- τ: 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3, so ττ allowed.

So possible decay channels are X → (u d, s s, c c, e e, μμ, ττ). Wait, but wait, what about the quarks? The Lagrangian is given as -λ f ψ_f... Hmm, the interaction term is written as L(y) = -λ f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting this. Or maybe it's a typo. Wait, the interaction term looks a bit off.
