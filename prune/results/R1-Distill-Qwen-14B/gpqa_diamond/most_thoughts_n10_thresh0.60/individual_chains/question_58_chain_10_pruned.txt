Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which one never requires regularization. Let me think about what regularization means. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the math work out by introducing a temporary 'cutoff' or some other method. But once you get the finite result, you remove the regularization.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as other quantum field theories. Because strings vibrate at different energies, and maybe the theory is background-independent, so it doesn't need the same kind of renormalization. Wait, but I'm not sure if it still requires some form of regularization when dealing with loop diagrams or high energies. Oh wait, string theory's strength is that it's a theory of quantum gravity and it avoids some of the problems with perturbation theory because of the way it handles high energies. So maybe it doesn't need regularization in the same way.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD does have asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, making perturbative methods work. But wait, when you calculate things like loop diagrams, you still get divergences. So you must use regularization techniques here. Like dimensional regularization or something else. So QCD does require regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I know that QED calculations require renormalization, which involves dealing with infinities. So yeah, regularization is definitely needed here. Without regularization, the calculations blow up, so they have to regularize to get meaningful results.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical ED, you don't have infinities in the same way because you're not quantizing the fields. For example, in Maxwell's equations, you can have point charges, but when you calculate things like the self-energy of a charge, you might get infinities, but those are handled in a different way, perhaps through the concept of renormalization in classical terms, but I don't think you
