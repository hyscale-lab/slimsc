Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different values.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma (γ) multiplied by the velocity (β). So, the mean distance L = c * γβ * τ, where τ is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find τ? Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for the width Γ (which is ΔE), the lifetime τ is roughly ħ/(Γ). But wait, I think Γ is the total decay width, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). But I'm not entirely sure about the exact relation. Oh wait, I remember now: τ is the inverse of the total decay rate, which is Γ. But since Γ is the decay width, the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, no, the natural line width is Γ = ħ
