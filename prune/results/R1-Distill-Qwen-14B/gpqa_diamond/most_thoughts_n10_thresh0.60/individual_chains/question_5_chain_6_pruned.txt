Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think aloud as I go through it.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The components of the operator P (Px, Py, Pz) are provided as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. And I need to determine the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, the operator P is probably the spin operator, right? Because spin operators have components similar to this. The eigenvalues for spin are ± ħ/2, so the eigenvalue +ħ/2 makes sense.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so it's like a polar angle θ from the z-axis, but since it's in x-z, the azimuthal angle φ is 0 or π, maybe? Or perhaps it's something else, but I'll get back to that.

So, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n. The spin operator along an arbitrary direction can be found using the Pauli matrices. The general form is P = (ħ/2) (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

Wait, but in this problem, the components of P are given as matrices. So Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is σ_x. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]] which is σ_y. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], which is σ_z.

So the operator P along direction n is a combination of these components. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, n has components (nx, 0, nz). Because any direction in the x-z plane would have no y-component. So n is (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, no. The usual spherical coordinates have n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0, because any direction in x-z would have zero y-component. So φ = 0, so cosφ = 1, sinφ=0. So n becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait no, wait. Wait, the x-z plane is the plane where the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n can be represented as (a, 0, b), with a² + b² = 1. So, yes, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the polar angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along n is:

P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z )

But n_y is zero, so:

P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z

Substituting the given matrices:

P = (n_x * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0
