Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about a wave function and finding the normalization constant 'a'. I remember that wave functions need to be normalized, meaning the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, so it's a complex function. To find the normalization, I need to calculate the integral of the absolute square of this function from x=1 to x=3 because the particles are only found between these points.

But wait, let me think about the wave function structure. It's written as a complex number: real part minus imaginary part. So the absolute square would be (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So the absolute square is [ (a / sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5)^2. 

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a^2)/(1+x) ) + 0.25 ] dx must equal 1. 

Let me write that out as an equation: ∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts: the integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so the first part becomes a² * [ ln(1+3) - ln(1+1) ] = a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) is ln(2).

The second part, integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3, is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So putting it together: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2). Let me compute ln(2). I remember that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. That must be the answer.

Wait, but did I make any mistakes here? Let me double-check the steps. The wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. When squared, it's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. Integrate from 1 to 3. Yep. The first integral is a² ln(2), the second is 0.5. Sum to 1. So a² is 0.5/(ln 2). Calculations look correct. So the answer should be B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \(a\), we start by normalizing the given wave function \(\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i\). The normalization condition requires that the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\) equals 1. 

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\).  
   The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln(1+x)\), so:

   \[
   a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+3) - \ln(1+1)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\).  
   This evaluates to:

   \[
   0.25 \int_1^3 dx = 0.25 (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtracting \(0.5\) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \(a\) is approximately \(0.85\). Comparing this with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
