Okay, so I've got this science question about dyes and the light they emit. Hmm. The question says that a textile dye with an extensively conjugated pi-electron system emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. And I need to find out what color it absorbs. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Wait, I remember something about the relationship between energy and wavelength. Oh right, the energy of a photon is inversely related to its wavelength. Like, higher energy means shorter wavelength, and lower energy means longer wavelength. The formula I think is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, and λ is wavelength.

So first, I should probably convert the given energy from eV to wavelength. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Oh wait, I remember that 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of about 1240 nm. So if the energy is 2.3393 eV, the wavelength λ would be 1240 / 2.3393. Let me calculate that. 

1240 divided by 2.3393. Let me see, 2.3393 times 500 is about 1169.65, so 1240-1169.65 is 70.35. So 70.35 divided by 2.3393 is approximately 30.08. So total wavelength is about 530.08 nm? Wait, 500 + 30 is 530? No, wait, 2.3393 * 530 would be 2.3393 *500=1169.65 plus 2.3393 *30=70.179, which adds up to 1239.8, which is close to 1240. So yeah, the wavelength is approximately 530 nm.

Wait, but wait a second. The energy given is 2.3393 eV, and since the energy is the energy of the emitted photon, that's the energy corresponding to the wavelength of the emitted light. But the question is about the color absorbed. Oh right! Because when a dye emits light, it's reflecting or emitting that color, which is the complementary color of what it absorbs. Because dyes work by absorbing certain wavelengths and reflecting others. So if a dye emits green light (around 530 nm), it must be absorbing the complementary color. 

Wait, what's the color of 530 nm? The visible spectrum ranges from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). 530 is in the green region. So the emitted light is green. Then, the absorbed light would be the complementary. Let me think about the color wheel. The complement of green is magenta, but I don't see magenta as an option. Hmm, the options are red, violet, blue, yellow. Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The energy of the absorbed photon would be related to the energy gap in the molecule. The dye has a conjugated pi system, which allows for delocalized electrons, resulting in lower energy transitions. But wait, that might not
