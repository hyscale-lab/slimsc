Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about density matrices and their geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, what does this represent? I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this one isn't like that. Instead, it's a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ projectors, each multiplied by 1/2.

So, each term here is a projector. Let me write them out in matrix form. The |0⟩⟨0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0s elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| has a 1 in the bottom-right and 0s elsewhere. When I add them together, each gets multiplied by 1/2. So, the resulting matrix is diagonal with 1/2 and 1/2 on the diagonal.

Wait, so ρ is a diagonal matrix [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. That looks familiar. Isn't that the maximally mixed state for a single qubit? Yeah, I think so. The maximally mixed state has equal probabilities for both states |0⟩ and |1⟩. So, it's like a completely random state between the two.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubits space. I'm not entirely sure what that refers to, but I think it's about the Bloch sphere representation. Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. For a pure state |ψ⟩, it's represented as a point on the surface of the sphere, with the vector r giving the direction. But for mixed states, it's inside the sphere.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. I remember the formula: ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. Let me break that down. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, the vector r has components (x, y, z), and the dot product r·σ is xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z.

Given that, our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me expand each of those projectors. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So, I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. But wait, in ρ, we have (I) multiplied by 1/2. So ρ is (I)/2, which is [[1/2,0],[0,1/2]].

Now, according to the Bloch sphere
