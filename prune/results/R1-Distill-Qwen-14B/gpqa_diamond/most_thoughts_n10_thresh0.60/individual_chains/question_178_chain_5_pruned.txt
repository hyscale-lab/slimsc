Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum field theory problem. The question is about determining the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ in a given Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that the mass dimension of a coupling constant is important because it tells us about the renormalizability of the theory. If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory is renormalizable; if it's negative, it's not. Oh wait, wait—I think I might have that backwards. Let me think.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of κ. So first, I should probably figure out the mass dimensions of each field involved.

Let me recall the mass dimensions for common fields. The fermion field ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in 4 spacetime dimensions, the Dirac equation leads to ψ having [ψ] = 3/2. Then, the field strength tensor F^{μν} for electromagnetism has a mass dimension of 2. Right, because F is derived from the gauge field A, which has dimension 1, and F involves derivatives of A, so [A]_M =1 → [∂A]_M = 2, so F has dimension 2.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? Oh, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. So it's an antisymmetric tensor built from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} doesn't contribute any mass dimension. So the [σ_{μν}]_M is 0.

Putting it all together: The Lagrangian term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's find the mass dimension of each part.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor) also has dimension 3/2. The σ is dimensionless, and F has dimension 2.

So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions: (3/2) + (3/2) +0 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3, and multiplied by F (2), gives 5. But that's just the fields part. The term is multiplied by κ, so the entire term must have mass dimension 4 because the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime. Because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over 4 dimensions, each Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

So [κ][ψ̄ σ ψ F] =4. We have [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [ψ̄ ψ] [F] = (3) (2) =6? Wait, no, wait. No, ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, so each ψ̄ ψ is 3. Then σ is dimensionless, then F is 2. So the product is (3) * (2) =6. So [L] = [κ] *6 =4. Therefore, [κ] =4/6=2/3? Wait, that can’t be right because none of the options have 2/3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So how many derivatives or fields?

Wait, σ_{μν} is made from [γ_mu, gamma_nu], so it's antisymmetric, but dimensionless. So each field ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ is 3. Then F^{mu nu} is 2. So the product is (3) * (2) =5? Wait, but then the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, which is (κ) * (3/2 + 3/2 + 0 +2) = κ * (3 +2) = 5. So [κ][5] =4 → [κ]=4-5= -1? Wait, no, wait. No, the Lagrangian term has dimension 4. So the product [κ] * [ψ̄ σ ψ F] =4.

So [ψ̄] is 3/2, [ψ] 3/2, [F] is 2. So [ψ̄ ψ
