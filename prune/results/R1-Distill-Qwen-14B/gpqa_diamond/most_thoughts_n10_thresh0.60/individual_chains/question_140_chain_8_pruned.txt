Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The problem describes a reaction where Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is just under 277 K. Also, the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a close analog of it.

I think I should break this down piece by piece.

First, let me think about gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the molecular formula must be something where protons (which are the same as the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule if it's a neutral molecule) equal the number of neutrons. Wait, wait, no—each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for each molecule, neutrons = protons.

Wait, no, the question says the gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think: so each molecule of W has equal number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, water has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons in the common isotope). So water molecule has 2*(1p +1n) + 8p +8n = 10p, 10n. So 10 each. So water's molecule would have equal number of p and n. Hmm, but wait, that's not the only possibility.

Wait, but wait, another example: CO2. Let's see, C is 6p, 6n (assuming 12C), O is 8p, 8n. So CO2 has 6+ (2*8) = 22p and 6 + (2*8)=22n. So that's a possibility too. So W could be CO2 or H2O, perhaps. But considering the reaction with X, which is heavier isotope, maybe something else.

Wait, but the precipitate G is formed when X reacts with Y. Then, when G is heated, it releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Let me think about the melting points. 277 K is about 4°C (since 273 K is 0°C, 277 is 4°C). So which substances have a melting point near 4°C? Hmm, maybe something like ammonium chloride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal, but most metals have higher melting points. Wait, but another possibility—perhaps B is a metal oxide or something else.

Wait, another approach: the product when a keto acid reacts with X has two oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like ketones with a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like cyclohexanone has a keto group, but maybe the product here is something else. Wait, when a keto acid reacts with a strong base, perhaps it would form a salt. But here, X is the reagent. So perhaps X is a base? Or maybe a metal, like Mg or something.

Wait, X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an element in it that has a heavier isotope. For example, chlorine has two isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if X is something like CH3Cl, but maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps X is something like sodium or potassium, or a heavier isotope of another metal.

Wait, in the reaction with liquid Y, which might be water, perhaps? If Y is water and X is a metal, like potassium or sodium. But potassium reacts violently with water, releasing H2 gas (hydrogen
