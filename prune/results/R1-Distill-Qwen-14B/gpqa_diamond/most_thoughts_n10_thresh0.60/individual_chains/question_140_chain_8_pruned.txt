Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand everything.

So, the question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. The question is about calculating the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. Since the problem gives some clues, I can probably deduce each part.

Starting with the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's something like a metal reacting with an acid. If Y is a liquid, perhaps it's a strong acid like sulfuric or hydrochloric. But wait, the reaction releases gas W. Let's think about what gas that could be. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule's formula would be something like H2O, NH3, or maybe CO2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the possible gases.

Another thought: if X is a metal, maybe Y is an acid. The reaction produces gas—common ones are hydrogen or maybe carbon dioxide. Let's consider each case.

If the gas is H2, then each molecule has 2 H atoms. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so the number of protons would be 2, but neutrons would be 0. That doesn't match because the number of protons and neutrons would be the same only if each has 0.5, which isn't possible. Wait, no, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The gas W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in total. So for H2, each molecule has 2 protons (since each H has 1) and 0 neutrons. So total protons = 2, total neutrons = 0. Not equal. So H2 is not it.

What about CO2? CO2 has C (6 protons) and O (8 each). Each CO2 molecule has 6 + 16 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each O has 8, so 6 + (2×8) = 22. Oh wait, so for each CO2 molecule, protons = 22, neutrons = 22. So that fits the condition. But wait, is CO2 a possible product of a metal reacting with an acid? Not really. More likely, a metal reacting with an acid would release H2 gas.

Wait, another option: maybe the gas is NH3. Each molecule has 1 N and 3 H. Nitrogen has 7 protons, 7 neutrons. Hydrogen has 1 each. So total protons: 7 + 3×1 = 10. Neutrons: 7 + 3×0 =7. No, that doesn't match. Not equal.

Another possible gas: maybe CH4? Protons: 6 + 4 =10. Neutrons: 6 + 4×0=6. Not equal. So that's not it either.

Wait, what about O2? Each O has 8 protons. So O2 would have 16 protons in total. Neutrons: each O has 8, so O2 would have 16. So 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits the condition. So W could be O2. But wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule, and its production from a reaction between a metal and an acid is less likely. Usually, O2 is produced from reactions involving peroxides or other oxidizing agents.

Wait, perhaps the gas is something else. Let me think again. The molecule has same
