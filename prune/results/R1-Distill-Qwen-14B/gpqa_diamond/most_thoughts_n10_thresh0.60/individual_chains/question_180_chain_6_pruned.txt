Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that, which is 2 * 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each is about 3.204e-19 C. 

But wait, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. I think that means the 13th is at the origin, and the others are all at 2 meters away from it. So the setup is like a central charge with 12 others forming a sort of sphere around it, each at radius 2m.

The question is about the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But since we're dealing with multiple charges, I think we have to consider the potential energy between each pair of charges and sum them all up.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the system. There are two kinds of interactions here: the 13th charge (at P) with each of the 12 charges, and the
