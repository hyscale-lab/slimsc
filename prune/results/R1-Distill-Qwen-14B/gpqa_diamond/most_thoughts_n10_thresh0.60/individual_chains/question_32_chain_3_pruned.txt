Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nuclei they're using. Hmm, the question says the speed is 0.96c, and the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. I remember that Li typically has 3 protons, so Li-6 maybe? Or wait, Li-7? Oh right, because Li has atomic number 3. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 since 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Or wait, wait, no: wait, Li has 3 protons, each with a mass of about 1.007 u, but when you have 3 neutrons, the atomic mass number is 3 +3=6, so it's Li-6. But wait, I've heard that Li is usually Li-7 in nature, but maybe this problem is talking about Li-6.

Wait, but actually, the problem says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. So Li has 3 protons, so 3 protons plus 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6, with mass number A=6. So the mass of each nucleus is approximately the mass of 6 nucleons. But wait, actually, the exact mass might be better considered using the atomic mass, but for heavy ions, relativistic effects are considered.

The question is about finding the energy of the RHIC. I remember that
