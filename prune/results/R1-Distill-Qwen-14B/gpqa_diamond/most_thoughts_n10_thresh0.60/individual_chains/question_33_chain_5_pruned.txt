Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. I need to identify the exo product from the given options. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cycloadditions, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are part of the Diels-Alder reaction family. Wait, but wait, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] between a diene and a dienophile, right? So here, the diene would be the more conjugated one, and the dienophile the less. But wait, thiophene is an aromatic five-membered ring with a sulfur. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups on the furan ring. So what's happening here?

Wait, wait, another possibility: maybe this is a type of electrocyclic reaction? No, the question says it's a [4+2] cycloaddition, so Diels-Alder it is. Let me think about the structures.

2,5-dimethylthiophene has methyl groups on carbons 2 and 5. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketones at positions 2 and 5. So, furan is O=C-O-C-O=C-? Wait, no, furan-2,5-dione would have the d
