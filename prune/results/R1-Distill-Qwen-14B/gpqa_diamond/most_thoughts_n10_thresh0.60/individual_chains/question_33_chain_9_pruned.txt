Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the exo product of a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. Hmm, let me think about what I remember regarding cycloadditions.

The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and they're heated. I'm pretty sure that when two dienophiles or dienes undergo a cycloaddition, especially under thermal conditions, it's usually a Diels-Alder reaction or maybe some other pericyclic reaction. Wait, [4+2] is the Diels-Alder, right?

Wait, but wait. 2,5-dimethylthiophene is a five-membered ring with two methyl groups and a sulfur. Thiophene is aromatic, so it's usually a diene in Diels-Alder. But in this case, since it's reacting with furan-2,5-dione, which is a dione, maybe it's acting as a dienophile? Or is one of them the diene and the other the dienophile?

Wait, Diels-Alder is a [4π + 2π] cycloaddition, so one component is a diene (conjugated double bonds) and the other is a dienophile (usually something like a carbonyl with a double bond). Thiophene has a conjugated system, so maybe it's the dienophile here. But wait, furan-2,5-dione has
