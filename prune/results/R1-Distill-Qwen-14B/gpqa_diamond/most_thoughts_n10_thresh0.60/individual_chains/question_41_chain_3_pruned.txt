Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, things get a bit tricky because of relativity. Let me think. 

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light in the glass relative to the lab. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Wait, but here, the medium is moving, so maybe I need to consider the motion of the glass affecting the observed speed.

Wait, maybe I should think about it using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving, so the light's speed in the lab frame would depend on both the speed in the glass and the glass's movement. 

So, in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. Because when a medium is stationary, the speed of light in it is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, which sees the glass moving, I have to add these velocities relativistically, not just add them normally.

The relativistic formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)). But wait, in this case, when the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is
