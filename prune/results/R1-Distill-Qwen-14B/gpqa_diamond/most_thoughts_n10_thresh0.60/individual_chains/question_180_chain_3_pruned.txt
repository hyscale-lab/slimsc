Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, so the setup is about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Since all the particles are identical and we're dealing with their arrangement, I think this is a problem about calculating the electric potential energy between them.

Wait, the system is isolated, so we're probably looking at the potential energy between all pairs of charges. I remember that the electric potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1*q2)/r. Since all charges are the same, this should be manageable.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 m from P. So the 13th charge is at the center, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from it. So the distance between the fixed charge and each of the 12 is 2 meters.

But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Are they all at the same point, 2 meters away from P? Or are they arranged in a circle or something else? The problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 is 2 m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. Wait, but when the problem is asking for the minimum energy, perhaps the system's configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the 12 charges are as close as possible to each other. Or maybe it's when they are arranged in a way that the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, electric potential energy between charges is a positive number when the charges are of the same sign because they repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, we need to arrange the charges as close as possible, but since their arrangement is fixed in this scenario? Or perhaps the 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P but can move around each other.

Wait, the problem says 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So maybe
