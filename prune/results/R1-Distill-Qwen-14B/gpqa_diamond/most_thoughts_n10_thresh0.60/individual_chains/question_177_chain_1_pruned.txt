Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and think through it step by step. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, I remember that luminosity is related to a star's radius and temperature. Oh right, the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, right? Where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Wait, but wait—how does mass relate to luminosity? Oh, wait, I think the problem mentions that the stars radiate as black bodies, so maybe mass isn't directly relevant here? Or perhaps it's a red herring? Because the main factors affecting luminosity here are radius and temperature.

The question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max would be inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2. That's important because if their temperatures are the same, the only thing affecting luminosity is the radius.

Wait, but wait... Oh, no, wait. The problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So that would mean the same λ_max, which implies same T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait again. Alternatively, could it mean that the observed wavelengths are the same due to redshift or blueshift? Oh, because the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Oh, right, that's velocity towards or away from us. So the Doppler effect would shift the observed wavelengths.

Wait, this adds a layer. Because the stars' actual temperatures would determine their emitted wavelengths, but because they're moving, the observed wavelengths are shifted.

Hmm, so
