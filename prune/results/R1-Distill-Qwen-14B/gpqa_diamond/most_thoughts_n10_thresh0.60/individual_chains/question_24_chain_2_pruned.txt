Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, it's a bit involved, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the question is about some mixtures and reactions. Let me read through it again.

We have a mixture X, which is equimolar of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same hydrocarbon Z. Z is a solvent with a mass fraction of hydrogen of 14.28%, and it doesn't react further with hydrogen. Also, X's compounds don't have conjugated multiple bonds.

The question is the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me break this down.

First, mixture X has two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So, what causes bromine water to decolorize? I remember that alkenes and possibly some other unsaturated compounds can do that because they undergo addition reactions with bromine. Also, maybe some dienes or other unsaturated structures.

But wait, the compounds in X don't have conjugated multiple bonds. So they might have isolated double bonds or maybe just single double bonds but not conjugated. So perhaps each is a mono-alkene or something similar.

When X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. For example, like in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2.

But wait, which substances undergo disproportionation? Maybe a diene or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials, when hydrogenated, produce Z. Let me think about hydrogenation. Hydrogenation typically adds H2 across double bonds, turning alkenes into alkanes.

Hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Similarly, hydrogenation of Y gives Z as well. So, both X and Y, when fully hydrogenated, produce the same product Z.

That suggests that Z is an alkane, because alkenes would hydrogenate to alkanes. So Z is a fully saturated hydrocarbon, likely an alkane.

Now, Z's mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z.

Hydrogen mass fraction is about 14.28%. So, let's suppose Z is CnH2n+2 (since it's an alkane). The mass of hydrogen is (2n+2)*1/(12n + 2(2n+2))? Wait, no. Wait, let me compute the percentage.

The percentage by mass of hydrogen is (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) *100 = 14.28%.

Assuming Z is CnH2m. Let me find n and m.

Wait, Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's CnHm. Let's compute the percentage as (m*1)/(12n + m) ) * 100 = 14.28.

Looking for integers n and m that satisfy this.

14.28% is approximately 1/7, since 1
