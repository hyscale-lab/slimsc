Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is given as 10 angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each.

Wait, wait. I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is calculated using a formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. But I'm a bit confused about the exact formula, especially for non-cubic systems.

Oh right! For a general crystal system, the formula is d = (a^2 b^2 c^2)/( (h^2/k^2 + l^2/l^2 + m^2/m^2) - ... ) )^(1/2) . No, wait, that's not right. Actually, the formula is more complicated.

Wait, let me get this straight. The interplanar distance formula is given by:

1/d² = (h²/k²)/(a² sin² β γ) + (l²/k²)/(b² sin² α γ) + (m²/k²)/(c² sin² α β)

But wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Perhaps it's better to recall the formula for a rhombohedral system specifically since all the angles are the same. Oh, right! A rhombohedral crystal
