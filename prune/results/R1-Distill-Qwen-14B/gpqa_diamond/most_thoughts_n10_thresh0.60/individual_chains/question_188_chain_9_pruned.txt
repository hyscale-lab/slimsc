Okay, so I've got this problem here about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals are a type of crystal structure where all the atoms are arranged in a trigonal system, right? So all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which means all edges are equal but the angles can be different. But in this problem, the angles are all 30 degrees. So α = β = γ = 30°, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. 

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interplanar distance, I think, refers to the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh, right, that's called the d-spacing. So I need to calculate the d-spacing for the (111) plane.

I remember there's a formula for interplanar distance in a crystal structure. For a general cubic system, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where a is the lattice parameter and (hkl) are the Miller indices. But wait, in this case, it's not a cubic system—it's rhombohedral, so I can't use that formula directly. Oh right, because in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell isn't cubic, it's a rhombohedron. So I need a different approach.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is more complicated. Let me try to recall. Oh, right, the formula is given by:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) )

Wait, but since all the angles α, β, γ are equal (30 degrees each), then the formula can be simplified. Also, since the Miller indices are (1,1,1), h=k=l=1.

So substituting h, k, l as 1, the denominator becomes sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 + 2*(1*1 cos 30°) *3 terms? Let me think.

Wait, let me write it more carefully. The general formula for d-spacing in a rhombohedral system is:
