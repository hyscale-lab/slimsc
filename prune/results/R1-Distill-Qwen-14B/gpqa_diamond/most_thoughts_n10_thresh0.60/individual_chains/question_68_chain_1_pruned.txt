Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a spin 1/2 particle. Hmm, I remember that spin is a form of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. The particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So mu = γSz.

The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Wait, when a magnetic moment is in a magnetic field, it tends to align with the field. So the initial state must be the spin-up state along z, which is the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue ħ/2. But wait, wait. Spin 1/2 particles have spin quantum number s=1/2, so Sz eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the initial state is |↑z⟩, right?

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So initially, the Hamiltonian would have been proportional to Sz, and after the switch, it's proportional to Sy.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. The average starts oscillating. I need to find the frequency.

I recall that when the Hamiltonian changes, the state of the system might not immediately change, leading to time evolution governed by the new Hamiltonian. So the initial state is |↑z⟩, but after the field switches, the system evolves under H = -γ B S_y (since magnetic moment is mu = γ S, and energy is -mu·B, so H = -mu · B). Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the interaction energy is H = -mu · B. So when B is along y, H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but I've also heard that sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = ω S·n, where ω is some frequency. But let me think, the magnetic moment mu is γ S, so the energy is U = -mu·B. So H = -gamma B (S·n), where n is the direction of B. So in this case, n is along y, so H = -gamma B Sy.

But wait, sometimes the Hamiltonian is written as H = ω S·n, where
