Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to tackle it step by step.

The problem gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a good starting point. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to see what kind of structure I'm dealing with. For C8H9NO, the formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So n=8, m=9, x=1 (O), y=1 (N). Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 -1)/2 = (18-11)/2 = 7/2=3.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I did the formula wrong. Let me recalculate: 2n +2 is 18. Minus m (9) gives 9, then minus x (1) gives 8, minus y (1) gives 7. 7 divided by 2 is 3.5 degrees of unsaturation. That's not possible because degrees should be whole numbers. Maybe I messed up the formula. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Oh, wait, perhaps the O and N count as one each. So the calculation is correct. Hmm, but 3.5 degrees would imply some issue. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it in terms of rings and double bonds.

Wait, another approach: each degree is a ring or a double bond. Let's see, the formula for a saturated compound would be CnH2n+2OxNy. So for n=8, it would be C8H18O... Wait, but here the formula is C8H9NO, which is less than that. So let me calculate the deficit.

For a saturated compound (alkane), H would be 2*8 +2 =18. But our compound has 9 H, which is 9 less than 18. Each double bond or ring accounts for 2 H less. So 9 deficit /
