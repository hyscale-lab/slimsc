Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice physics problem about the potentials in the electromagnetic field generated by a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are described using scalar and vector potentials.

The question gives me a point charge q moving with a trajectory s(t), and I'm supposed to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The setup involves the origin, the field point r, and a vector d from the point where the field was generated to the observation point r.

I think I should recall how potentials are derived for moving charges. I remember that the scalar potential usually comes from the electric field, and the vector potential from the magnetic field. For a static charge, the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε0 r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because you have to consider the retarded time.

Wait, the problem says that the velocity at the generating time tr is v. So I need to consider how the motion affects the potentials.

Scalar potential for a moving charge: I think the scalar potential still includes the charge term, but it might be affected by the motion. But wait, in the case of a moving charge, the scalar potential is similar to the static case but with a correction for the retarded time and possibly some velocity terms. Or maybe not, because the scalar potential in the Lorentz gauge is based on the charge density.

Wait, no, the scalar potential due to a charge moving with velocity v would be V(r, t) = (q/(4πε0)) * [something involving the charge and the distance, maybe including the velocity? Or maybe not directly, because the scalar potential is primarily from the electric field, which is due to the charge's presence, but the vector potential comes from the magnetic field due to the charge's motion.

Wait, from what I recall, the scalar potential for a moving charge might have a term involving the velocity. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form. Alternatively, sometimes the vector potential is expressed in terms of the velocity. Let me think about the potentials from a moving charge.

The vector potential A is generally given by (μ0/(4π)) * (q v × r') / (r'^2 c^2) or something along
