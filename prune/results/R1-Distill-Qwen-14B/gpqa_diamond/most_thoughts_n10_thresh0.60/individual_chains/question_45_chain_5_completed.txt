Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² * pi² * ħ²) / (2mL²), where n is the quantum number, m is the mass, L is the width of the well, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. They've given E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E corresponds to n=1. So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on. Each energy level is n squared times E.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2. Oh right, that means they're fermions, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Which implies that each quantum state can hold a limited number of particles. Since they're spin-1/2, each particle has spin up or down, so each spatial state can hold two particles.

So the particles are fermions, and each spatial orbital can have a maximum of two particles with opposite spins. So when arranging them in the lowest energy states, I have to make sure that each energy level doesn't get more than two particles before moving to the next level.

The problem is about four particles. So I need to distribute them into the available energy levels, starting from the lowest.

Let's think about the ground state first. The ground state is the lowest energy configuration. So the particles will fill the lowest available energy levels, considering the Pauli exclusion.

The spatial wavefunction for each particle in the well is given by the quantum number n. Each n corresponds to a specific energy. For the first level (n=1), E1 is E. Since each n can have two particles (because spin can be up or down), n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more, but wait, since we have four particles, n=1 and n=2 each can hold two each. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, four particles. Each n can have two particles (each with opposite spin). So for four particles, n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two as well. But wait, that would make four, so the ground state would have all four particles in the first two energy levels.

Wait no, wait. Let me correct myself. If you have four identical fermions, each with spin 1/2. The spatial wavefunction (n) can hold two particles each (spin up and down). So for n=1, that's two particles. Then n=2 can also hold two particles. So for four particles, they would occupy n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So the ground state would have the lowest energy, which is when all four particles are in the lowest possible levels.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the particles are identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But since the spatial and spin parts are considered, perhaps I don't need to worry about the spin here beyond the fact that each spatial state can hold two particles. So the way to fill the particles is to put as many as possible in the lowest energy levels, each level holding two particles.

So for four particles, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2 (again, opposite spins). So the total energy for the ground state would be (number of particles in each level multiplied by their energies). Each in n=1 contributes E, each in n=2 contributes 4E.

Wait, but wait, each level can hold two particles. So for n=1: 2 particles, each contributing E. n=2: 2 particles, each contributing 4E. So total energy is (2 * E) + (2 * 4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

Wait, but that can't be because the options don't have 10E as the ground state. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E, 50E

C)4E, 10E, 15E

D)10E, 15E, 18E

Hmm, the ground state is the lowest possible energy. So in the ground state, the four particles would occupy the lowest available n values with two particles each in n=1 and n=2. So their energies would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2E + 2*(4E) )= 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state energy would be 10E.

Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait. Because each particle in a state n contributes E_n. So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2, each, each n=1 contributes E, each n=2 contributes 4E.

So the total energy would be 2 * E + 2 * 4E = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but what about the first excited state? Let me think.

In the ground state, particles are in n=1 and n=2. The first excited state would involve the next possible arrangement.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I should think about the ordering. The ground state is when the particles are filled up as much as possible in the lower levels. So for four particles, the ground state is when two are in n=1 and two are in n=2, as each n can have two particles.

But wait, what happens if you have four particles in a 1D box with spin 1/2? Let me think more carefully.

Each orbital (defined by n) can hold two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, the first two go into n=1, and the next two go into n=2.

So the ground state energy is 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2E + 8E = 10E.

But wait, wait, this can't be right because in the options, some have lower energies, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The four particles are in the lowest possible energy levels. So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two, so their energies are E and 4E respectively.

But wait, in that case, the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the options don't seem to have 10E as the ground state. Let me look again.

Option B says ground state is 4E, first excited 10E.

Option C: 4E, 10E, 15E.

Option D: 10E, 15E, 18E.

Wait, but why is the first option A starting at 30E? That seems high.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. The particles are identical spin-1/2 fermions, so each n can hold two particles.

So for four fermions, the first two go into n=1 (each with opposite spins), and the next two go into n=2. So each of those particles in n=2 will have energy 4E.

So the total energy of the system is 2E (from n=1) plus 2*(4E) (from n=2). That's 2E +8E= 10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but that would mean that the ground state is 10E, which is option D's first state. But the question asks for the ground state, first excited, and second excited.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about what the excited states would look like.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me approach this differently.

Each of the four particles is in a spin-1/2 state, so each spatial orbital (n) can hold two particles. So the distribution in the ground state would be:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down).

n=2: two particles (again, spin up and down).

Wait, but wait, that's four particles. So that's the ground state, which would have total energy 2E + 2*(4E) = 10E.

But the first excited state would be when some of the particles are promoted to higher energy levels.

Wait, how can we get the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next state with higher energy. Let me think about possible configurations.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all particles are in the lowest possible orbitals, but perhaps I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, maybe the particles are arranged in a way that the first excited state has one particle in n=3, but I need to think about the possible arrangements.

Wait, perhaps the particles are arranged in the ground state as two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving a total energy of 10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but then what is the first excited state? Let's see. To reach a higher energy, one of the particles from n=2 would move to n=3.

But wait, in the ground state, all four particles are in n=1 and n=2. Let's think about possible excitations.

But wait, perhaps the first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3. But since each n can only hold two particles, perhaps the first excited state would involve moving one particle from n=2 to n=3, but that might not be the case because each n can hold two, so maybe you can have more than that.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible states.

The ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Total E =10E.

The first excited state could be the next possible configuration, which would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3.

Wait, but you can't have three particles in n=2 because each n can hold a maximum of two. So perhaps the next step is to have three particles in n=1 or something else.

Wait, no. Because n=1 can only hold two. So if you have four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2, then the next possible state would be moving one particle from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but then you'd have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 4E + 4E? No, wait, the n=3 has E_3 =9E. So the total energy would be 2E (n=1) + 4E (n=2, one particle) + 9E (n=3, one particle) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, that's a total of 15E. So that would be higher than the ground state's 10E.

Wait, but wait, the first excited state would be the next lowest energy available. So perhaps the first excited state is when the second and third particles are in n=2 and the fourth is in n=3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list all possible configurations.

The particles are four, so possible ways to distribute them across the energy levels:

1. Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). Total energy 10E.

2. First excited state: perhaps one particle from n=2 moves to n=3. So the distribution is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Total energy would be 2E + 4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but is that the first excited state? Alternatively, perhaps another configuration yields a lower energy?

Another option: what if one particle moves from n=2 to n=3, but another moves from n=1 to n=2? No, that would make n=1 have one particle and n=2 have three, which is impossible because each n can hold two. So that's not allowed.

So the next possible state is when one particle moves from n=2 to n=3. So the energy becomes 2E + 4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are distributed as n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Alternatively, maybe another configuration exists with a lower total energy.

Wait, another possibility: what if the particles are arranged as n=1 (2), n=3 (2)? But wait, n=3 can hold two particles. So that would be 2E + 2*(9E)= 2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than 15E, so it's higher than the previous option.

So the first excited state would be 15E.

Wait, but then what's the second excited state? The next possible arrangement would be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but since in the first excited state, n=2 has one particle, moving another would require that n=2 has zero, and n=3 has two. So the distribution would be n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2). The energy would be 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) =2E +18E =20E.

Alternatively, another option might be to have one particle in n=4. Let me calculate that.

Another possibility: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=4 (1). The energy would be 2E +4E + 16E =22E. That's higher than 20E, so 20E would be lower.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the second excited state could have a lower energy by moving a particle from n=3 to a lower n if possible. But can you have a configuration where n=2 has two and n=3 has one? No, because n=2 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps another configuration: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and n=4 (0). No, that's already considered.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when you have two particles in n=3 and two in n=4. No, that would be 2*9E +2*16E = 18E +32E=50E. That's higher than 20E.

So perhaps the first excited state is 15E, and the second excited state is 20E. But looking at the options, option D says the energies are 10E,15E,18E. So 18E is the third option. But according to my calculation, second excited state is 20E.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is 10E, but that can't be because that's the ground state. So perhaps the ground state is lower than that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, each particle is spin-1/2, so for each n, two particles can occupy that state. So to find the ground state, we fill the lowest possible n with two particles each until all four are placed.

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles

n=2: 2 particles

Total energy: 2E + 2*4E = 2E +8E =10E.

So the ground state is 10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement, which is when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So the distribution becomes:

n=1: 2

n=2:1

n=3:1

Each of these contributes 2E,4E, and 9E respectively.

So total energy would be 2E +4E +9E =15E.

That's the first excited state.

The second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. What's the next one?

After the first excited state, the next would be moving another particle to a higher n.

So, perhaps moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. Then we have:

n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2.

Total energy is 2E + 0 + 2*(9E) = 2E + 18E=20E.

So the second excited state would have energy 20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 20E as the third option. Let me check the options again.

Option D says: 10E,15E,18E.

Hmm, that's possible if perhaps the second excited state is 18E, which would correspond to a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some other possible lower energy configuration.

Wait, another possibility: instead of moving a particle to n=4, perhaps it's higher but another arrangement could have a lower energy.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is 10E, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and one in n=3, but that would require three particles in n=2, which is impossible because each n can have two.

Wait, perhaps another approach: perhaps the particles are placed in the lowest energy levels, but considering that each level can hold two.

Wait, let's think of the energies of the system as the sum of the individual energies of each particle. So each particle has n_i, and the total energy is the sum of each E_{n_i}.

So the possible states for four particles are:

Ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. Total E=2E + 2*4E=10E.

First excited state: one in n=3, rest in lower levels. So two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Total E=2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: another particle promoted to n=3, making two in n=3, and the rest in n=1 and n=2. So two in n=1, zero in n=2, two in n=3. Total E=2E + 0 + 2*9E= 2E +18E=20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, and the others are in lower levels.

So, for example: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. The total E would be 2E +4E +16E=22E.

But that's higher than 20E.

Alternatively, another configuration: two particles in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=1. But that's similar to the first excited state.

Wait, but perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So two in n=1 (E=2E), and two in n=3 (E=2*9E=18E), leading to a total of 2E + 18E=20E.

But again, the options don't have 20E as the third option.

Looking back at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E.

Hmm, how would that happen? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, and the others are in n=1 and n=2. That's 15E as I thought earlier.

The second excited state would then have two particles in n=3 and two in n=2. Wait, but that can't be because n=2 can only hold two particles. So if two are in n=2 and two in n=3, that would be 2*4E + 2*9E =8E +18E=26E. That's higher than 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has two particles in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=4. So E=2*4E + 9E + 16E=8E+9E+16E=33E. That's higher.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing another possible configuration.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2, one in n=3, and one in n=1. Then E=2E + 2*4E +9E=2E +8E +9E=19E. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when all four particles are in n=2. But that's impossible because each n=2 can hold only two particles. So no, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But no, n=2 can only hold two. So that's impossible.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps in the first excited state, two particles are in n=1 and two in n=3. So the energy would be 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. But that's higher than the 15E I previously thought for the first excited state. So that can't be the first excited state.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But again, n=2 can only hold two, so that's impossible.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in how the particles are arranged. Another approach: perhaps the ground state is when the particles are arranged such that they have the lowest possible sum of n². So for four particles, the minimal sum of n² is achieved by two in n=1 and two in n=2: the sum being (1² +1² +2² +2²)=1+1+4+4=10. So the total energy is sum * E=10E.

The first excited state would have a higher sum. The next possible sum could be achieved by changing one of the 2's to a 3. So sum becomes 1+1+4+9=15. So energy 15E.

The second excited state would have another change, perhaps another 2 becomes a 3, making sum 1+1+9+9=20. So energy 20E.

But the options don't have 20E as a choice. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't 15E but a lower energy. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and the others are arranged as two in n=1 and one in n=2. So the sum is 1² +1² +2² +3²=1+1+4+9=15. So energy 15E.

The second excited state could be when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So sum is 1+1+9+9=20. So energy 20E.

But looking at the options, only option D has 10E,15E,18E. So perhaps I'm missing a configuration where the second excited state is 18E.

Wait, 18E would correspond to a sum of n²= 18, because E= pi² hbar²/(2mL²), and each E_n is n² E. So 18E would be n²=18.

But 18 isn't a perfect square. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, making sum 1+1+4+16=22, which is 22E. But that's not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So sum is 1+1+9+16=27, which is 27E.

But again, no option matches.

Hmm, maybe I've made a mistake and the ground state is not 10E. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the particles are placed in a way that the ground state has all four particles in the same n, which is impossible because each n can only hold two. So that's not possible.

Wait, so the ground state must be two in n=1 and two in n=2, giving total energy 10E.

But looking at the options, option D says the energies are 10E,15E,18E. So the first excited state is 15E, which is correct, and the second excited state is 18E.

So how can the second excited state be 18E?

Wait, 18E would mean that the sum of the squares is 18.

Wait, that's not possible with four n's.

Wait, each n is a positive integer, so the sum of four n's squared.

Wait, 18 can be achieved by 1² +1² +3² +3² = 1+1+9+9=20. No, that's 20. Wait, perhaps another combination.

Wait, 18 can't be the sum of four squares. Let me check:

Wait, 18 as a sum of four squares:

Let me think: 3² + 3² + 0² +0²? No, because n starts at 1.

Wait, 18 can't be achieved with four n's ≥1.

Wait, 1² +1² +2² +4²=1+1+4+16=22.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the second excited state. Let me try to think of possible arrangements that could sum to 18.

Wait, 18E means the sum of the squares is 18.

Wait, 18 can be written as 3² +3² +0... but n can't be zero. So perhaps 18 isn't achievable.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=3, and the others in n=1 and n=2. Let's see: n=1: 2 particles (E=2E), n=2: 1 particle (4E), n=3:1 particle (9E). That's the first excited state, which sums to15E. The next would be two particles in n=3 and two in n=2, which isn't possible because n=2 can only hold two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4. So the sum would be 1+1+9+16=27, which is 27E. That's even higher.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when all four particles are in the same n. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try to list all possible configurations and their energies.

Possible configurations for four fermions in 1D well with spin 1/2 (each n can have two):

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2): sum=1+1+4+4=10. Energy=10E.

2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): sum=1+1+4+9=15. Energy=15E.

3. n=1 (2), n=3 (2): sum=1+1+9+9=20. Energy=20E.

4. n=1 (2), n=2 (0), n=3 (2): sum=1+1+9+9=20.

5. n=1 (2),n=2 (1),n=4 (1): sum=1+1+4+16=22. Energy=22E.

6. n=1 (2),n=3 (1),n=4 (1): sum=1+1+9+16=27.

7. n=1 (2),n=4 (2): sum=1+1+16+16=34.

8. n=2 (2),n=3 (2): sum=4+4+9+9=26.

9. n=2 (2),n=4 (2): sum=4+4+16+16=40.

10. n=3 (2),n=4 (2): sum=9+9+16+16=50.

Wait, so the possible energies in order are 10E,15E,20E,22E,26E,27E,34E,40E,50E.

So the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state is 15E.

The second excited state would be the next lowest, which is 20E.

But in the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

So this suggests that perhaps I'm missing a configuration where the sum is 18E.

Wait, 18E would require sum of squares to be 18. Let me see, perhaps 1² + 2² + 3² + 2² =1+4+9+4=18. Yes, that's 18.

So n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1, n=4:0? Wait, no, four particles.

Wait, wait, let me see: if the configuration is n=1 (1), n=2 (2), n=3 (1). Wait, no, because each n can hold up to two particles.

Wait, n=1 can have two, n=2 can have two, etc.

So, to get the sum of squares as 18, perhaps we have:

n=1: 2 particles (sum 2*1=2)

n=2: 2 particles (sum 2*4=8)

n=3: 0 particles.

Wait, that's sum=2+8=10.

Hmm, that's 10E.

Alternatively, perhaps another configuration.

Wait, perhaps n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Sum is 1+1+4+9=15.

Ah, that's the first excited state.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. Wait, but that's four particles.

Wait, n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. Sum is 1² +2² +1²=1+4+1=6. Wait, but that's only three particles. So to make four, perhaps n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. Sum is 1+4+1=6, but that can't be right because four particles would require four terms in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the configuration is n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. So the sum is (1²) + (2² *2) + (3²) =1 + (4*2) +9=1+8+9=18. Oh, that's 18.

So the sum of squares is 1+4+4+9=18.

Wait, wait, four particles: n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. So n=1 has one particle, n=2 has two, n=3 has one. But wait, each n can have a maximum of two. So that's allowed.

But wait, n=1 has one particle, which is fine because it can hold two. So in this configuration, the sum is 1² + 2² + 2² +3² =1 +4 +4 +9=18.

So the total energy is 18E.

So this would be another possible state with energy 18E.

So if that's possible, then the energies would be:

Ground state:10E.

First excited state:15E.

Second excited state:18E.

Which matches option D.

So how does this configuration happen? Let me think.

Wait, the ground state is when n=1:2, n=2:2. Then, for the first excited state, one particle from n=2 moves to n=3, so n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1. Sum 15.

Then, the next possible state could be moving another particle from n=2 to n=3, but that would require n=2 to have zero and n=3 to have two. But wait, that would sum to 2*(9E) + 2E =18E +2E=20E. But no, wait, n=1:2, n=2:0, n=3:2. Sum is 2*1² + 2*3²=2+18=20.

Wait, but the configuration I thought of earlier, with sum 18, is when n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. So that would require having one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3. That would imply that one particle was promoted from n=1 to n=3, but that would be a higher energy than just promoting from n=2 to n=3.

Wait, but in the ground state, all particles are in the lowest possible levels. So in the configuration n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1, that would imply that one of the particles in n=1 was promoted to n=3, which would be a higher energy than moving from n=2 to n=3.

But since the first excited state is the lowest possible higher energy state, perhaps the next higher state after 15E is 18E, and then 20E.

But according to the sum I calculated earlier, 18E comes from 1² + 2² + 2² +3²=1+4+4+9=18.

Wait, but that would require n=1:1, n=2:2, n=3:1. So one particle in n=1, two in n=2, and one in n=3.

But how can that happen? Because the ground state already has two in n=1 and two in n=2. So to get to this configuration, you would have to move one particle from n=1 to n=3, which would increase the energy by 9E - E =8E. So the total energy would increase by 8E, making it 18E.

But in the first excited state, moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 only increases the energy by 5E (9E-4E=5E), making the total 15E.

So the configuration with energy 15E is lower than the configuration with 18E.

Thus, the correct order would have 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 18E (second excited).

So the correct answer must be option D: 10E,15E,18E.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 fermions in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

### Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Potential Well
The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:

\[
E_n = n^2 E \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
\]

For this problem:
- \(E_1 = E\),
- \(E_2 = 4E\),
- \(E_3 = 9E\),
- \(E_4 = 16E\), and so on.

### Ground State
Since the particles are fermions, they obey the Pauli exclusion principle, and each quantum state (defined by \(n\)) can hold a maximum of two particles (one with spin up and one with spin down). To minimize the total energy, the particles will occupy the lowest available energy levels.

- **Configuration**: Two particles in \(n=1\) and two particles in \(n=2\).
- **Total Energy**: 
  \[
  E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 2(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E.
  \]

### First Excited State
The first excited state corresponds to the next lowest energy configuration. This occurs when one particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), while the remaining particles remain in \(n=1\) and \(n=2\).

- **Configuration**: Two particles in \(n=1\), one particle in \(n=2\), and one particle in \(n=3\).
- **Total Energy**: 
  \[
  E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
  \]

### Second Excited State
The second excited state corresponds to the next higher energy configuration. This occurs when another particle is promoted from \(n=2\) to \(n=3\), leaving one particle in \(n=1\) and two particles in \(n=3\).

- **Configuration**: One particle in \(n=1\), two particles in \(n=2\), and one particle in \(n=3\).
- **Total Energy**: 
  \[
  E_{\text{second excited}} = E_1 + 2E_2 + E_3 = E + 2(4E) + 9E = E + 8E + 9E = 18E.
  \]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: \(30E, 39E, 50E\) — These values are far too high and do not correspond to the calculated energies.
- **Option B**: \(4E, 10E, 50E\) — The ground state energy is incorrect (\(10E\), not \(4E\)).
- **Option C**: \(4E, 10E, 15E\) — The ground state energy is incorrect (\(10E\), not \(4E\)).
- **Option D**: \(10E, 15E, 18E\) — Matches the calculated energies for the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is:

**Ground state energy**: \(10E\),  
**First excited state energy**: \(15E\),  
**Second excited state energy**: \(18E\).
