Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The scenario is that a small peptidic compound was chemically synthesized, and the crude product's 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly correct except for two peaks that should be the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, so together they account for the expected amount. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Then, the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as the expected molecule.

Hmm. So what's going on here? Let's break down the clues.

First, the NMR: duplicate peaks for the same proton. Oh wait, but same integral together as 1H, meaning each is about 0.5H? That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe each peak is integrating to approximately 0.5H each, adding up to 1H total. So the same proton is being split into two. But why?

Well, if the coupling is ruled out, it's not like it's splitting into a doublet or something. Wait, sometimes in NMR, you can have spin systems that split into more peaks, but the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out. So maybe it's something else causing two peaks for the same proton.

Then the LC-MS part: two peaks with the same mass, same intensity. So the
