Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to think through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, assuming ideal pH and temperature of 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Okay, so I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The formation constant, K, is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

The complex here is Ca-EDTA. Let's denote the complex as CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4−. The reaction for the formation of the complex would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. We're to find [Ca²+], the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

So, the setup is that the complex is at 0.02 M, and we need to find the free calcium concentration, given K is 5e10.

But wait, I think I should model this. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as [CaY²−] = 0.02 M. The formation equation is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− → CaY²−.

But in solution, the reverse reaction can also happen. The K for the formation is given, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the K is Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But wait, I might be mixing up the K expressions. Alternatively, sometimes the K is written as the dissociation constant, Kd, which is the inverse of Kf. But I think in this context, K is the formation constant, so Kf = 5e10.

Wait, wait. Let me get that right. Formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from the ions. So:

Kf = [CaY²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

So, given that, and assuming that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and that the solution is such that the complex doesn't dissociate much. Wait, but wait, what's the initial condition?

Wait, the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial [CaY²−] is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it can produce Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So, I can model this with an ICE table.

Let me set up the ICE (Initial,
