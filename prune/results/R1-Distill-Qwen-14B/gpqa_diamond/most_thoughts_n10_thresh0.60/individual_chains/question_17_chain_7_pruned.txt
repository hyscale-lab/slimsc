Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think it through. Oh wait, it's about the concentration of calcium ions when they form a complex with EDTA. Right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it binds metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's stoichiometric here mean? Oh right, it probably means that the molar ratio of Ca²+ to EDTA is 1:1 in the complex. So the complex is CaEDTA²−, maybe?

The question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. They also gave the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5×10^10. Oh wait, formation constants can be a bit tricky. I remember that the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−

And Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, wait. The problem gives K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. Hmm, sometimes K is given as the formation constant, but sometimes it's given as the dissociation constant. Wait, no, Kf is formation, so if the complex dissociates, Kd would be 1/Kf. But I think in this case, K_Ca-EDTA is the formation
