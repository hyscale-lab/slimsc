Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of expectation values and all these sigma matrices. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. Hmm, okay.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So for any operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

Wait, but here the operator is a combination of σ_z and σ_x. So I think I can calculate each part separately and then add them together. Because expectation values are linear, right? So ⟨aA + bB⟩ = a⟨A⟩ + b⟨B⟩. That should make things easier.

Let me write down what I know. The state ψ is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's check if the coefficients make sense. The square of the coefficients should add up to 1 because the state should be normalized. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good.

First, I'll find the expectation value of σ_z. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σ_z are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right? Because σ_z |↑⟩ = +|↑⟩ and σ_z |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So the expectation value ⟨σ_z⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So that's (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let me compute that.

0.5 squared is 0.25, so 0.25 *1 = 0.25. sqrt(3)/2 squared is 3/4, so 3/4 * (-1) is -3/4, which is -0.75. Adding those together: 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the expectation value for 10σ_z is 10 times that, which is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Okay.

Next, I need to find the expectation value of 5σ_x. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but maybe I don't need that. Instead, perhaps I can compute it directly using the given state.

Wait, σ_x is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to find ⟨σ_x⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

But I also remember that for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_x is (|α|^2 + |β|^2) real part? Wait no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me represent the state as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. Now, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So let's compute ψ† σ_x ψ.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So multiply this with
