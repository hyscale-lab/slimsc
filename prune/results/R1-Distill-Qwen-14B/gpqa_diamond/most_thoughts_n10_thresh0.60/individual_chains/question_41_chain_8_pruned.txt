Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c divided by the refractive index, right? So normally, without any movement, the speed would just be c/n. But since the glass is moving, I guess we need to consider some sort of relative velocity here.

I think this involves relative motion and maybe the addition of velocities. Oh wait, but when objects move at significant fractions of the speed of light, we have to use special relativity. But here, the problem doesn't specify that v is close to c. Hmm, so maybe we can use a simpler approach, like Galilean addition?

Wait, but isn't the speed of light always c in any inertial frame? Oh wait, no, wait. That's only in vacuum, right? Because in a medium, light's speed is lower. But wait, no, wait again. Oh wait, no, in any inertial frame, the speed of light in a vacuum is c. But in a medium, like this glass, the speed is c/n. So how does the motion of the glass affect this?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.
