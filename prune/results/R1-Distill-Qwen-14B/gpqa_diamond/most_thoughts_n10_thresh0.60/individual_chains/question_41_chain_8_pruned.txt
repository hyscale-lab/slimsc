Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me think. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The speed of light in a vacuum is c, which is given as 1 here. The question is asking for the speed of the light beam relative to the observer in the laboratory.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with light in different media, the speed of light isn't just c anymore. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So when the medium is stationary, the light's speed is c/n. But here, the medium (glass) is moving, so I think I have to consider the velocity addition from special relativity or maybe just classical velocity addition. Hmm, but wait, special relativity applies when dealing with velocities close to c, but the problem doesn't specify if v is significant relative to c. Oh, but in this problem, c is taken as 1, so maybe the velocities are small compared to c, so perhaps we can use the classical approach.

Wait, but actually, if the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed of light as observed? Because in classical mechanics, velocities just add up. But I'm not sure if that's correct for light. Oh, because in reality, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, according to special relativity, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But wait, this isn't a vacuum. The light is in the glass, so the medium is moving.

Wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. So when the glass is moving, how does that affect the light's speed in that medium?

Wait, maybe I should think about this in terms of reference frames. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. The light inside the glass has a speed of c/n relative to the glass (the rest frame of the glass). So I need to find the speed of the light as observed from the lab, where the glass is moving at v.

But wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. So using the velocity addition formula from special relativity, the speed u' observed in the lab would be (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/cÂ²), but wait, because u is the velocity of
