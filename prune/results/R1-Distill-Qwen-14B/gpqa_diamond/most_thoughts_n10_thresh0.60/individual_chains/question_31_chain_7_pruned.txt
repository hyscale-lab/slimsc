Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with toluene. It goes through three steps, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group of the final product, product 3.

First, the first step: toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitric acid with sulfuric acid is a nitrating agent. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitrating toluene usually happens under certain conditions. Since toluene is an activating group, the nitration would occur at the para position, but sometimes ortho as well. Wait, wait. No, nitration of toluene is typically para dominant, but there's also some ortho. Oh wait, no, in reality, toluene nitration gives a mix, but more para than meta. Wait, wait, the nitration of toluene occurs primarily in the para position, but the ortho is also possible. The product would be a nitro group attached.

So product 1 is methyl nitrobenzene, specifically, para-nitro toluene? Or is it a mix? But for the next step, unless the mixture is separated, but the problem states product 1, so maybe it's the major product, which is para.

Next step: product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. Hmm, MnO2 is often used in oxidation reactions. In the context of aromatic chemistry, MnO2 under acidic conditions might be involved in nitration or something else. Wait, no, MnO2 is commonly used for the oxidation of nitro groups to nitro groups? Or wait, perhaps in the oxidation of an amine, but in this case, product 1 is nitrobenzene derivative.

Wait, product 1 is para-nitro toluene. So it's a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group in the para positions. Now, treating this with MnO2 and H2SO4. Oh, wait, MnO2 is used in the oxidation of toluene derivatives. For example, when toluene is oxidized, the methyl group becomes a COOH group. But wait, in this case, the compound is already nitro-substituted. So maybe the methyl group is oxidized.

Wait, I think MnO2 in
