Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem talks about a compound A that has a proton NMR with two signals. The first signal is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, A undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. The options give four possible structures for D, all cyclohexenol derivatives.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by figuring out what compound A is. The NMR data might give us a clue. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H suggests that these protons are likely on a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group because a triplet for six protons might imply two neighboring groups. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the triplet with 6H: for a triplet, the neighboring group must have two protons. So maybe it's two methyl groups each attached to a CH2. 

Wait, let's think. A triplet in an NMR usually arises when a proton is next to two equivalent protons. So if we have a CH2 group adjacent to another group, say CH(CH3)2, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted something like ethyl groups.

Wait, but the triplet is for 6H. That makes me think of two separate methyl groups each attached to a CH2. Like maybe (CH2CH2CH3)2CH? No, wait. Or perhaps it's a structure where there's a central CH with two CH2CH2CH3 groups attached. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps a diethyl group or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies that each of those protons is next to a group with three protons. Wait, no, a quartet for four protons? Wait, the integral is 4H, and the splitting is quartet. So each of those four protons is adjacent to a group with three protons. Hmm, wait, that might
