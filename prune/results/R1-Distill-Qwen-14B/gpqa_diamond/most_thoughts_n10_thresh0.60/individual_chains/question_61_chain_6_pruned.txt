Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene. Let's go through each step one by one.

First, benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that HNO3 is a nitrating agent, and when benzene reacts with it in the presence of a sulfuric acid catalyst, it undergoes nitration. The nitration of benzene typically happens at the meta position if there are substituents, but since benzene is just benzene here, the first substitution will be in the para position. Wait no, wait. Or is it that nitration occurs at the meta position when there's a meta-directing group? No, wait. Benzene itself doesn't have any substituents, so the nitration would produce nitrobenzene. But wait, wait, no, benzene's first substitution is ortho, meta, para... Wait, actually, when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group can go in any position, but it's generally para if starting from a symmetrical position. Hmm, no, wait. Benzene is symmetric, so the product of nitration is nitrobenzene, which is a mono-substituted benzene with the nitro group. But wait, I think that the nitration of benzene under certain conditions can give a mix, but in most cases, the major product is para. Or maybe I'm confusing this
