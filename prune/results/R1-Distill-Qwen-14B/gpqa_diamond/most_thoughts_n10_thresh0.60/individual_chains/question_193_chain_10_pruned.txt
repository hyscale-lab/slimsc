Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me see what it's about. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Because, if something is closer, its parallax is larger, right? So plx is proportional to 1/d, where d is the distance.

Wait, so if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. But here, N is proportional to 1/plx^5, so that's d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the variables. Let me think again.

The problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/(plx)^5. So, N = k / (plx)^5, where k is some constant. Since parallax plx is equal to 1/d (if we measure d in parsecs, I think), plx = 1/d. So substituting that into the equation, N = k * d^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. Oh, right, it's asking about how the number changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.
