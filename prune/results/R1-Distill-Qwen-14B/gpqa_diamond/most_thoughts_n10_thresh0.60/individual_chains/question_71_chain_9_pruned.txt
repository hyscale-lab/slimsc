Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits, discovered via the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The albedo is the same for all, so that shouldn't affect the calculation. We're supposed to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the inverse square law. The temperature depends on the distance from the star, right? Oh, and the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. But wait, another way I remember it is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, assuming the same star and same albedo.

Wait, no, wait. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. And since the planets are in a circular orbit, the period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. So, P² is proportional to a³, if we're considering the same star. So, a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So for each planet, their semi-major axis a is proportional to P^(2/3). Because Kepler's law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a = (P²/(4π²/GM))^(1
