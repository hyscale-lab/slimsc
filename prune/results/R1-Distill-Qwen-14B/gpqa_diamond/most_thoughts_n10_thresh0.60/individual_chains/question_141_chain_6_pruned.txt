Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to determine how many possible organic products are formed. The options given are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, first, I should try to draw the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: benzene has six carbons. 1-bromo would be on the first carbon, and 2-d? Oh wait, wait, maybe that's a typo or misunderstanding. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because 'd' might refer to the number of substituents or something else. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is also known as bromobenzene with two methyl groups in the 2 and 4 positions. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? No, the question says 'd', which I'm not sure about. Oh wait, maybe the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Or perhaps it's a typo, and the 'd' refers to something else, like deuterated? Hmm, but the main point is to figure out the structure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the benzene ring has a bromine on carbon 1, and methyl groups on carbons 2 and 4. That makes sense because 2,4-dimethyl would give certain possible positions for substitution.

Then, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially for eliminating HX from alkyl halides. But wait, in aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 is also a strong base that can abstract protons, perhaps leading to elimination or deprotonation steps.

Wait, but wait: in the context of aromatic substitution, when a benzene ring has strong activating groups, but in this case, bromine is a deactivating group because it's an electron-withdrawing substituent. So, the ring is probably deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, but when we have a
