Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question involves two reactions with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So, the starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Both reactions go to 100% completion.

So, first I need to think about what reactions these are. For each starting alkene, treating with mCPBA will form an epoxide. Then, when you add aqueous acid, the epoxide will undergo an acid-catalyzed ring-opening reaction.

Wait, but wait. Epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions typically involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. The ring opens with the attack of a nucleophileâ€”water in this case, since it's aqueous acid. The nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized. So the epoxide ring is opened to form a diol.

But wait, the initial step is epoxidation. So for each isomer of oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form differently. Let me think about that.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA epoxidizes the double bond, the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. So for the (E) isomer, the epoxide would form with the two substituents (like the two CH2CH3 groups) on opposite sides. Similarly, the (Z) isomer would form an epoxide with substituents on the same side.

But wait, in oct-4-ene, each end is CH2CH2? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. So the structure is CH2CH2 in positions 4 and 5. Let me write it out. The structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in the middle. So, position 4 and 5 are double bond. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the full structure would be CH2CH2 with substituents on either end. Wait, oct-4-ene is actually CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me correct. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. So the structure would be CH2CH2 with CH2 groups on either side. So the complete structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, octane has 8 carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. So structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not right. Let me correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. So it's CH2CH2 with two CH2 groups on each end. So the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, maybe I should write it as CH2CH2 in the middle, but perhaps each end has three CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps an easier way: for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2 with CH2CH2 on either side. So, I can imagine the molecule as follows: CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me count. Carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH2, carbon 3
