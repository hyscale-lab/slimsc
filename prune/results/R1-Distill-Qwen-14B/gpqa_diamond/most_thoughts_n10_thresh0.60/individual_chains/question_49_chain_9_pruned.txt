Okay, I'm trying to solve this pericyclic reactions question. Let me start by understanding what each reaction is about.

So, the first reaction is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. I remember that these conditions usually lead to some kind of rearrangement, maybe a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... that structure has two methoxy groups on a nitrogen. Oh, wait, that's like a substituted ethylene diamine or something. But when it reacts with an alcohol like but-3-en-2-ol, maybe it's forming a cyclic structure. Oh! Maybe a hemiacetal or something else. Wait, another thought: the 1,1-dimethoxy group suggests that when it loses a methanol molecule, it might form a ketene or something. Alternatively, I think of the Claisen rearrangement, which involves allyl vinyl ethers. Hmm. Wait, if the amine has two methoxy groups, maybe it's acting as a base. Alternatively, perhaps the acid (H+) is protonating something. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Maybe they undergo some kind of cyclization.

Wait, wait. Another approach: the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Structure: CH3O-N(CH2CH2OCH3)-something? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(OCH3)2-NH2? No, that can't be. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 on the first carbon, so CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe (CH2OCH3)2NH. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary amine with two methoxy substituents on the same carbon. So structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe it's (HOCH2CH2O)N something... I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder? Hmm, but Diels-Alder requires a diene and a di
