Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decays. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but hopefully, I can figure this out.

The question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the notation, but I think the important part is that X interacts with fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so that's a crucial point because decay products must have masses less than X's.

Wait, but wait. The boson X is a boson, so when it decays, it has to produce particles that add up to its mass. But wait, bosons can decay into fermions as long as energy and conservation laws are satisfied. Oh, but I think the key is to consider the mass of the decay products.

So the mass of X is 6 GeV. So any decay product pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let's remember the masses of the known fermions.

The known fermions (quarks and leptons) have the following approximate masses (I think):

- Up and down quarks: around a few MeV. Up is like 2.2 MeV, down about 4.7 MeV. So their masses are negligible compared to 6 GeV. So X can decay into u u-bar, d d-bar because their masses are so small.

- Strange quark: about 95 MeV. So two strange quarks would be 190 MeV. That's way below 6 GeV. So s s-bar decay is allowed.

- Charm quark: around 1.5 GeV. So c c-bar would have a combined mass of about 3 GeV. That's less than 6 GeV, so that's allowed.

- Bottom quark: around 4.5-4.7 GeV. So two b quarks would be about 9 GeV. Wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 4.5*2 is 9, which is way more than
