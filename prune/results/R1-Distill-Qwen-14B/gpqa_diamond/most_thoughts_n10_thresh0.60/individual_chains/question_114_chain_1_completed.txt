Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to pick the right reagents for each step from the given options. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are combinations of A and B, so I'll have to figure out what each reaction needs.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methyl acetone or something like that. NaCN is sodium cyanide. I'm thinking this is a nucleophilic addition reaction. Butanone reacting with a nitrile. Wait, usually, ketones react with nucleophiles in the presence of an acid catalyst. Oh right! I remember that for the formation of cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (like CN-) in an acidic condition.

So the reaction is probably a nucleophilic addition where the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. But for that, you need some acid to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So reagent A is probably an acid catalyst. The options have H3O+ or something else like NaHSO3.

Wait, what's NaHSO3 used for? Sodium bisulfite? I think that's used in the reduction of aldehydes and ketones to produce alcohols, but maybe in some other reactions too. Or perhaps in the workup after a reaction?

In the first reaction, butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives a cyanohydrin. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon, which is the former carbonyl carbon. That makes sense for a cyanohydrin formation.

So the reaction is: ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin with acid catalysis. So A is likely an acid, probably H3O+ because it's a strong acid. So looking at options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, while NaHSO3 is probably a weaker acid since it's a bisulfite. Or wait, NaHSO3 is in solution as H+ and HSO3^-.

Wait, but sometimes, when you use HCN, you might use a weak acid to protonate the solution. Wait, but the reagents here are NaCN and A. So NaCN is a source of CN-, and A is the acid.

So, for the cyanohydrin formation, you need an acid. So A is probably H3O+. That would be option A or B, since options C and D have A as NaHSO3.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I know that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. Let me think. Under acidic conditions, nitriles hydrolyze to carboxylic acids, and under basic conditions, they go to carboxylates, which can then be acidified to get the acid.

So in this case, the reagent B is H2O. Wait, but in the presence of H2O, but with what catalyst? Because just water wouldn't be enough for hydrolysis. There must be an acid or base catalyst. So B is either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid) or maybe another acid.

Looking at the options, in the second part, B is either HCl (option A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D).

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid. For nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical conditions are hydrolysis with strong acid and heat. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl in water.

So the reagent B would be HCl. Because when you add HCl (H+ and Cl-), it acts as a catalyst. So in the second reaction, B is HCl. Looking back, the options:

Option A: B = HCl  
Option B: B = CH3COOH  
Option C: B = HCl  
Option D: B = CH3COOH

So from the first part, A is H3O+ (if that's the case), which would fit options A and B. But from the second part, B is HCl, which would fit options A and C.

Wait, but the options are a combination. So if the first reaction needs A to be H3O+, the options are A and B. But if the second needs B to be HCl, then A and C. Let me see what the options are:

Options:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl  
B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH  
C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl  
D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So if in the first reaction, A is H3O+, the possible options are A and B. In the second reaction, B is HCl, so A is correct, and C is also possible. But for the first reaction, if A is H3O+, then option A or B is correct. Wait, but I thought NaHSO3 is a possible A. Could that work?

Wait, NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since it's a bisulfite), but is it a strong enough acid for the cyanohydrin formation? I think that for the cyanohydrin, the acid is usually HCN with some H+ like H2SO4, HCl, or H3O+.

Wait, but NaHSO3 in solution would produce H+ and HSO3^- ions. HSO3^- is a weak acid, so the solution would be somewhat acidic. But would that be enough for the reaction? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe NaHSO3 is used in another context. Wait, another thought: maybe in the first reaction, it's not acid catalysis but something else. Alternatively, could it involve a different mechanism?

Wait, but I'm pretty confident that the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone under acidic conditions. So the acid is needed. So if A is H3O+, then that's the right catalyst.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+, which is option A or B. The second reaction needs HCl as B because that's the catalyst for the nitrile hydrolysis to acid.

So the only option that has A as H3O+ and B as HCl is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the second reaction.

The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the structure is CH2(CO-OH)-CN? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN? Wait, but that's not correct. Let me draw it.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? No, butanenitrile is NC-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, but butanenitrile is actually CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be:

The carbon chain is four carbons. The nitrile is on the fourth carbon, but wait, butanenitrile would have the nitrile on the first carbon. Wait, no. Wait, butanenitrile is NC-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN? Wait, no, wait butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. So the nitrile is on the first carbon.

But in the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the nitrile is on the second carbon? Wait, but that would make it pentanenitrile? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. But regardless, the product is a cyanohydrin, so the nitrile and hydroxyl are on the same carbon as the former carbonyl group.

So the first reaction is definitely the formation of a cyanohydrin, which requires an acid catalyst. So A is H3O+.

Thus, in the options, the correct A is H3O+, which would be options A or B. The second reaction needs HCl as B. So looking at the options, only option A has B as HCl.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the second reaction again. The starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with a benzyl group. So the structure is something like (PhCH2)CH(OH)CH2CN? I'm not entirely sure, but regardless, the nitrile is being converted to a carboxylic acid.

So for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, the typical conditions are either strong acid with heating or using a base and then acidifying. Wait, but the question says the reagent B is H2O. H2O alone might not be sufficient. It's more likely that in the presence of an acid or base, the hydrolysis occurs.

So, when nitriles are hydrolyzed under acidic conditions, they produce carboxylic acids. Under basic conditions, they produce carboxylate salts, which can be acidified to get the acid.

So for the second reaction, the reagent B is H2O with an acid catalyst. So the correct reagent would be an acid like HCl. So B is HCl.

Putting it all together, the first reagent A is H3O+ and the second reagent B is HCl. Looking at the options, that's option A.

Wait but let me look at the options again. Option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. That's correct.

So the answer should be option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN-. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the strongest acid and is suitable for this purpose, making A = H₃O⁺.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a nitrile-to-carboxylic-acid transformation, which typically requires acidic hydrolysis. The reagent B must therefore be an acid catalyst. HCl is the appropriate choice for this reaction, making B = HCl.

From the options provided:
- Option A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
- Option B: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
- Option C: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
- Option D: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  

The combination A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl matches the requirements for both reactions, making **Option A** the correct choice.

Answer: A
