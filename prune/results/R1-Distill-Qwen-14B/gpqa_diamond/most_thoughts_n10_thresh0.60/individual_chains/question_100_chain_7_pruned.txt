Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question involves a series of reactions starting from Compound A. I'll take it step by step.

Compound A is C3H6. Hmm, wait, C3H6 can be either propene or cyclopropane, but propene is more common in such reactions. So, assuming it's propene. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Or wait, maybe it's isobutylene? No, C3H6 has a double bond, so propene.

Bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's a typical bromination of an alkene. Propene (CH2=CHCH3) would undergo bromination to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Wait, when an alkene reacts with bromine (Br2) in CCl4, it's an addition reaction. Propene has a central double bond. So, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2CHBrCH3.

Wait, but wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So the structure becomes CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

Then, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and heat is usually involved for elimination. So, 1,2-dibromopropane with KOH (alcohol) would undergo dehydrohalogenation, an elimination reaction. Wait, but each Br is on adjacent
