Okay, so I need to figure out which statement about the Mott-Gurney equation is true. Hmm, I remember that the Mott-Gurney equation describes the current-voltage relationship in certain semiconductor devices. It's specifically for the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. 

The given equation is J = (9/8) * epsilon * mu * (V^2)/(L^3). So, J is the current density, epsilon is the dielectric constant, mu is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage, and L is the length of the device. 

Wait, I think the Mott-Gurney equation applies to devices where the current is limited by the space charge. So, in this regime, the electric field is created by the charge that's accumulated due to the current flowâ€”because the external voltage isn't enough to completely deplete the material, so you get a built-in field from the space charge. 

So, the conditions for this equation to hold are important. From what I recall, it's applicable in the case of a single-carrier device. Because, if you have both electrons and holes (a two-carrier device), the situation might be different, especially in terms of how they contribute to the current and space charge.

Also, I think the equation assumes that the device has ohmic contacts. Ohmic contacts mean that the interface doesn't create any potential barriers for the carriers. If there were a Schottky contact, like in a diode, that would introduce a barrier which might complicate things. So, the equation probably doesn't apply there.

Another point is whether it's single-carrier. If you have a two-carrier device (like a bipolar junction transistor), then the behavior might not fit the Mott-Gurney equation. But if it's a single-carrier device, either electrons or holes, then the equation should work.

Wait, what about traps? Oh, right, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes a trap-free system. Because any traps would lead to more complicated behavior, like trapping and emitting of carriers, which isn't accounted for in the equation. So the device should be trap-free.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: Trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic contact, negligible drift current. Wait, negligible drift current? But the equation involves mobility, which is related to drift. If drift is negligible, maybe the current is due to
