Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. Half of its hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K, right?

The setup is that when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, causing brightness variations. These variations can mimic the signal of an exoplanet transit. The question is, what radius would an exoplanet need to have to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm. So I need to find the ratio Rpl/Rstar such that the planet's transit causes the same dip in brightness as the star's spots do.

Wait, but how do the spots affect the brightness? Well, when the spots are facing us, the total brightness decreases because the spots are darker. The amplitude of the dip depends on the area of the spots and how much cooler they are.

Let me think about the two scenarios: one is the star with spots, and the other is a planet transiting the star. We need to find Rpl where their brightness variations are the same.

First, dealing with the star's spots. The star's radius is Rstar, same as the Sun. The spots are on one hemisphere, so maybe the area is a certain fraction. The filling factor is 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere is covered. So the area of the spots is 0.2 multiplied by the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, the area of a hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, no—wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere. So if one hemisphere is spotty (so only half the star is showing spots), but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the area of spots is 0.2 * (area of hemisphere), which is 0.2*(2πR²) = 0.4πR².

But when the star rotates, the
