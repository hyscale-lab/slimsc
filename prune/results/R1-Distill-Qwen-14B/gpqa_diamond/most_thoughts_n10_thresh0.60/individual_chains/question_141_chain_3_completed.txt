Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Hmm, wait, first I should make sure I understand the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, the 'd' probably indicates a deuterium substitution. So, it's bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. Let me visualize the benzene ring. The bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. So, the structure is a benzene ring with Br at one carbon and D (deuterium) at the next, making them adjacent.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. In aromatic chemistry, I think it's used for removing protons to form benzyne intermediates, especially in the presence of good leaving groups.

Wait, but the starting material has a bromine. So, if we have a good leaving group like Br, and a strong base like NaNH2, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. Oh, right! Benzene rings with substituents where deprotonation and elimination can occur.

So, the mechanism would likely be elimination to form a benzyne intermediate. Let me think: in such a scenario, the base (NH2^-) would abstract a proton from the ring. The position of this proton is crucial. The best place for elimination would be adjacent to the bromine because that forms the most stable benzyne.

Wait, but the starting material already has a deuterium at position 2. Oh, so position 2 is D, which is a deuterium, so the proton there is actually a D, not a regular H. But wait, deuterium is a different isotope. So, when the base abstracts a proton, it's not going to take the D because D is less acidic than H? Or is it the same? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, in the benzene ring, the acidity of the protons is influenced by the substituents. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, making the adjacent protons more acidic. So, in 1-bromobenzene, the protons at position 2 and position 6 are more acidic because they're ortho to the Br.

But in this case, position 2 has a D. So, the H at position 6 (which is meta to Br) is more acidic than the H at position 4 (para), but wait, the para position is actually position 4, but in 1-bromo, the positions are 1 (Br), 2 (D), 3, 4, 5, 6.

Wait, perhaps I should number the ring correctly. Let me imagine the benzene ring with Br at position 1. Then position 2 is adjacent to Br. So, the positions adjacent to Br (ortho) are 2 and 6. But position 2 has a deuterium, so the H at position 6 is available. So, when NaNH2 is added, it would abstract a proton from either position 6 (ortho to Br) or maybe meta positions.

Wait, the typical benzyne formation from bromobenzene involves deprotonation at the ortho position relative to the Br, forming a triple bond (benzyne) as the intermediate. So, in the case where position 2 has D, the base can abstract H from either position 6 or perhaps position 4.

Wait, no, position 4 is para to Br. So, the Br is at 1, so the para position is 4. So, the positions ortho to Br are 2 and 6. But position 2 is D, so the only available ortho H is at 6. But wait, position 2 is D, which is a different isotope. So, can the base abstract that D instead?

Wait, deuterium is less acidic than protium because the bond strength is weaker? Or wait, the acidity of deuterium in such cases. I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think that deuterium is actually less acidic than hydrogen because the C-D bond is stronger than the C-H bond. So, D is a poor leaving group in such elimination reactions. So, in this case, the base (NH2^-) would prefer to abstract a regular H rather than D.

So, with Br at position 1 and D at position 2, the H at position 6 is the ortho position on the other side. So the base would abstract H from position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? Wait, no, wait. When the base abstracts H from position 6, which is ortho to Br at 1, the adjacent carbon would be position 5. Wait, perhaps I should draw this.

Alternatively, let's think about the positions. Br is at position 1. The adjacent positions (ortho) are 2 and 6. Position 2 has D, so the only H available in the ortho positions is position 6. So, the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? Or between positions 2 and 3?

Wait, no. Let me think about the mechanism. When the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the Br, the leaving group (Br-) departs, and a triple bond is formed between the adjacent carbons. So, the benzyne is formed by the elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond. So, in this case, the H must be abstracted from a position adjacent to Br, which is either 2 or 6.

But position 2 is D, so the base can't abstract that. So, the only possible H to abstract is position 6. Therefore, the triple bond would form between positions 1 and 6? Wait, no. Let me get this right.

Wait, when Br is at position 1, and the H is abstracted from position 2, then the triple bond would be between 1 and 2. But position 2 has D, so the H is not there. So, the H is abstracted from position 6, which is also ortho to Br. So, the triple bond would form between positions 1 and 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond could form between positions 2 and 3, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's another position.

Wait, but when you abstract a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br (position 1), the Br leaves, and the triple bond forms between positions 1 and 6. So, the benzene ring would have a triple bond between 1 and 6, making it a 1,6-didehydrobenzene (or benzyne).

But wait, the ring is symmetric. So, once the triple bond is formed, when it reacts further, it can undergo various additions. However, the question is about the products of this reaction. Wait, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. What's the role of NH3 here? Oh, right, in some cases, the benzyne can undergo ring expansion or other reactions, but in this case, perhaps the main reaction is the elimination to form benzyne, but I think that the reaction might stop there, or perhaps there's an addition.

Wait, another possibility: the elimination forms benzyne, which can undergo various reactions. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is aprotic. So, perhaps the benzyne is formed, and then undergoes some cycloaddition or other reactions. Or perhaps, the benzyne doesn't form because the starting material has a D, which affects the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium affects the acidity of the adjacent protons. Wait, D is less acidic, so the H at position 6 is more acidic than D. So, the base will abstract that, leading to elimination.

Wait, but in any case, the main step is the elimination to form benzyne. But what comes next? Or perhaps the reaction is only the elimination, and the product is benzyne. So, how many products would that be?

But wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d, so the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. When you eliminate H from position 6, you form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. The benzyne would have triple bond between 1 and 6. But, the question is about the organic products. So, if the reaction stops at benzyne, which is an inorganic product? No, wait, benzyne is a cyclic strained alkyne, so it's an organic product.

Wait, but maybe the reaction doesn't stop there. Perhaps the benzyne can react further. In the presence of a base like NH2^- and high temperature, benzyne might undergo dimerization or other reactions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, but in aromatic substitution, SNAr (aromatic nucleophilic substitution) typically requires a good leaving group and a ring that's activated towards nucleophilic attack, which usually requires electron-withdrawing groups. Bromine is such a group.

Wait, but in SNAr, the nucleophile (like NH2^-) would attack the ring at the position adjacent to the leaving group. So, in this case, the nucleophile would attack at position 2, which is adjacent to Br at position 1. But wait, position 2 has a D, not a H. So would that affect the substitution?

Wait, but wait: D is a deuterium, so it's a different isotope. In SNAr, the leaving group is typically substituted by a nucleophile. So, if the ring has a good leaving group (like Br) and is activated, the nucleophile would attack the ring at the meta position relative to the leaving group? Or wait, SNAr typically occurs at the position ortho or para to the leaving group, but in this case, the ring might have only certain positions available.

Wait, but in this scenario, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d. So, the ring has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. If SNAr occurs, the nucleophile (NH2^-) would attack either position 2 (ortho to Br) or position 4 (para to Br). But position 2 has D, which is a deuterium atom; can that be substituted?

Wait, D is a hydrogen isotope, so perhaps the substitution is possible. So, if the Br leaves and the nucleophile attacks, where would it go?

Wait, but in SNAr, the mechanism involves a negatively charged intermediate (the arenediazonium salt or similar), but perhaps I'm mixing up reaction mechanisms. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination to form a triple bond, leading to benzyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton elsewhere, leading to different products.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possibility of multiple elimination pathways. So, the starting material has Br at position 1 and D at position 2. The base could abstract a proton from position 6 (ortho to Br) or from position 4 (para to Br). Wait, but why would it abstract from position 4?

Wait, position 4 is para to Br. The acidity of the H at position 4 would be lower than that at position 6 because it's less activated by the Br. Because in aromatic rings, the ortho and para positions relative to an EWG like Br are more acidic than the meta.

So, the base would prefer to abstract a proton from position 6, which is ortho to Br. But then, that would lead to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6, creating a benzyne.

But wait, in this case, the starting material has D at position 2. So, after elimination, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, making a symmetric structure. But wait, the positions are 1-6, which are across from each other (since benzene is a six-membered ring). So, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, which are adjacent in the numbering.

Wait, no. In benzene, position 1 and 6 are adjacent. So, a triple bond between them would make it a 1,2-didehydrobenzene, which is also known as o-benzyne.

Wait, but if the triple bond is between positions 1 and 6, that's adjacent, so it's o-benzyne.

But wait, how many possible products are there? If the elimination occurs in only one way, then there's only one product. But wait, perhaps the benzyne can form in different positions, leading to different products.

Wait, another possibility: the base could abstract a proton from position 2, but position 2 has D, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to Br.

Wait, but the H at position 3 is less acidic than those at ortho positions. So, the base would prefer to abstract from the ortho position, which is position 6 in this case.

So, the elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, creating o-benzyne. But in the process, the D at position 2 is still present.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

So, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. The Br is at position 1, D at 2.

When treated with NaNH2 in ammonia, the reaction is probably dehydrohalogenation to form benzyne. The mechanism would involve removing a proton (H) adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a triple bond.

But in this case, position 2 has D, not H. So, the available H adjacent to Br is only at position 6.

So, the base abstracts H from position 6, leading to the formation of a triple bond between 1 and 6, making o-benzyne.

Wait, but wait: after elimination, the molecule would have a triple bond between positions 1 and 6, making it o-benzyne. But the position 2 has D; would that affect the structure?

No, because D is just a substituent on position 2, and the triple bond is between 1 and 6, so the D is on 2, and there's a triple bond between 1 and 6.

So, in that case, the product is o-benzyne with D at position 2.

But that's only one product, right? Because the elimination occurs in only one way, leading to one benzyne structure.

But wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Could the deuterium at position 2 affect the possibility of elimination at other positions? Or could elimination occur at a different position, leading to a different product?

Wait, maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 4, which is para to Br, but is that feasible?

I think the para position (position 4) is less acidic, so the base would prefer the ortho position (position 6) for elimination. So, the main product is o-benzyne with D at position 2. But that's just one product.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the D at position 2 could participate in some way, but I can't think of how. Since D is not a leaving group, and the base can't abstract it, it's just a substituent.

So, if only one product is formed, that would be option B, which is 1.

But wait, I'm not so sure. Maybe elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to different products.

Wait, another angle: when the benzyne forms, it can have different regiochemistry. For example, if the triple bond is between 1 and 2, or between 1 and 6. But in this case, position 2 has D, so the only possible H for elimination is position 6, making the triple bond between 1 and 6. So, only one benzyne product.

So, the number of organic products is one. Therefore, the answer should be option B, 1 product.

Wait, but wait another thought: when benzyne is formed, could it undergo different reactions in the same conditions, leading to more than one product? For instance, could it dimerize or something? But I think the question is about the products of the initial reaction, which is the elimination. So, the product is just the benzyne intermediate.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't stop there. Could the benzyne undergo addition reactions, leading to multiple products?

Wait, in the presence of NaNH2 and ammonia, perhaps the benzyne can undergo some kind of trapping. For example, the benzyne could react with the ammonia to form a ring expansion product or something else.

Wait, another possibility: the benzyne could undergo a [2+2] cycloaddition with another benzene ring, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, it could add NH2^- as a nucleophile.

Wait, if the benzyne is formed, then in the presence of a strong base like NaNH2, it might undergo some reactions. But I think typically, benzyne can undergo various additions, but in this case, since the solvent is ammonia, perhaps it's more about the formation of the benzyne.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne doesn't form because the D is in the way. But I don't think that's the case. The D is just a substituent; it doesn't block the elimination.

So, going back, the reaction is elimination to form benzyne, which is a single product. So, the number of organic products is one, so option B.

Wait, but another thought: could the benzyne rearrange or form different isomers? For example, could the triple bond form in more than one position, leading to different products?

In the starting material, the Br is at 1, D at 2. The only available H for elimination is at position 6, so the triple bond would be between 1 and 6, making o-benzyne.

So, only one product. Therefore, the answer is B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and deuterium at position 2. The reaction proceeds via dehydrohalogenation, where the strong base NaNH₂ abstracts a proton ortho to the bromine, leading to the elimination of the bromine atom and the formation of a benzyne intermediate. 

In this case, the ortho position to bromine is position 2, but it contains deuterium (D), which is not abstractable by the base due to its lower acidity compared to protium (H). Therefore, the base abstracts the proton at position 6, which is also ortho to bromine, resulting in the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. This forms o-benzyne (1,2-didehydrobenzene), with the deuterium at position 2 remaining intact.

The reaction does not proceed further to form additional products because the question focuses on the immediate products of the elimination step. Since only one pathway is possible for the formation of benzyne, the number of organic products is one.

Answer: B
