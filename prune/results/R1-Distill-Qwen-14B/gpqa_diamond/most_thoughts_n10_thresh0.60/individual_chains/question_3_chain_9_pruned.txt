Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, right, expectation values are like the average you'd expect to measure for an observable, given a state.

Wait, expectation values can be calculated by taking the conjugate transpose of the state, multiplying the operator, and then the state again. So for an operator A, the expectation is ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩. Right.

So, the state ψ is given as (0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩). Let me write that out in terms of a vector. Since |↑⟩ is [1, 0]^T and |↓⟩ is [0,1]^T, ψ would be a vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T. But wait, I should check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the amplitudes should be 1. So 0.5² is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75.
