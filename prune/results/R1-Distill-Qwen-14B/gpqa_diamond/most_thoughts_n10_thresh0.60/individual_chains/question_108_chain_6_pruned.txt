Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. The magnetic field has a strength of 1 Tesla, and m is a small value, probably meaning that the magnetic quantum number is small, like m=0 or maybe 1 or 2. The problem involves comparing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. 

Wait, 0.4861 micrometers is in the visible range, around the red part maybe? I think that corresponds to the H-alpha line or something, but not sure. Anyway, for hydrogen, transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength via the equation ΔE = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. Right, because E = hc/λ.

So I need to find out the magnitude of the paramagnetic term and compare it with this ΔE. Let's break it down.

The paramagnetic coupling term, I think, comes from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by the Bohr magneton times the magnetic quantum number m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is approximately 9.274×10^-24 J/T. 

The energy of the magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is U = -μ·B. Since the field is along the z-axis, the dot product simplifies to U = -μ_z B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be this energy. But wait, wait, the paramagnetic term is part of the Hamiltonian. Oh, right, the Hamiltonian for the magnetic interaction is H = -μ·B. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be this term.

So, let's compute ⟨H⟩. For each state with magnetic quantum number m, the energy is μ_B * m * B. But since m is small, like maybe m=0 or 1 or 2, perhaps. But wait, in hydrogen, the possible m values depend on the principal quantum number n. For example, for n=1, m can be 0; for n=2, m can be -1, 0, +1; etc. Oh, but the question says "small values of m". So maybe m is around 1 or 2, not a large number.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the magnitude of ⟨H⟩ and compare it with the transition energy ΔE from the hydrogen atom. So what's the value of ΔE?

Calculating ΔE: wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers. Let's convert that to meters: 0.4861e-6 m. Using hc
