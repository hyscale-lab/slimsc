Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters, right? And it contains 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for the KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the Na2HPO4·2H2O. Temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so maybe activity coefficients are ignored here.

The problem also gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, I remember that each Ka represents the dissociation steps of phosphoric acid. The phosphate species in solution can be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate ions usually refer to HPO4^2-, right? Because ortho- refers to the first dissociation step, I think. Alternatively, orthophosphate might be H3PO4, but I’m a bit confused. Let me think. Oh, wait, no. H3PO4 is the fully protonated form, so when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), then HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion), then PO4^3- (phosphate ion). Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, so the orthophosphate ion would be HPO4^2-, I think. So that's what we're looking for.

So the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me figure out what these salts dissociate into. 

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate? Wait, no. The formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, no, because the formula is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So each unit gives 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we'll have H2PO4^- from the KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from the Na2HPO4·2H2O. 

Wait, but wait—that's interesting. So we have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution. That sounds like a buffer solution. Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so their ratio would determine the pH. But the question is about the concentration of HPO4^2- (the orthophosphate) in the solution
