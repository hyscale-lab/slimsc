Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectroscopic data. The options are A to D.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretching, maybe from an amide or amine group. Amides typically have two N-H stretches, which might explain the two bands. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a good sign of a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide).

Moving on to the 1H NMR. Let's break down the signals:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H. This sounds like a CH2CH3 group, maybe an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2 group.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): A broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can indicate exchange or possibly an amine or amide. Maybe this is the N-H of an amide or adjacent to an electronegative group.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): A quartet integrating for 2H. Quartet with two H suggests a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. Like maybe an OCH2CH2O or something similar. But wait, in an ester, the ethyl group comes after the oxygen. So like OCH2CH3. But here, the quartet is at 4.5. Maybe the ethyl ester's OCH2 is split into a quartet because of coupling with the adjacent CH2.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are aromatic protons. The doublets each with 2H suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituents are in the para positions. So the benzene has two groups opposite each other.

Putting this together, the compound has a benzene ring with substituents in para positions. The IR suggests an amide or ester group. The NMR shows an ethyl group, so maybe an ester or an amide with an ethyl substituent.

Looking at the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. So DoU = (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11 +1)/2= (10)/2=5. So 5 DoU. That could be a benzene ring (3 DoU) plus a carbonyl (1 DoU) and a double bond or ring elsewhere (1 DoU). Or other combinations.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy in the meta position. But our NMR shows para substitution. Because the aromatic protons are a doublet each, so two doublets in para would suggest substituents on opposite sides.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide group attached at para to ethoxy. The formamide has a CONH2 group. Wait, but the NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. If it's a formamide, the NH would show up around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. Hmm, but the IR shows N-H stretches around 3400, which could be from formamide. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is present.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- but as a substituent. The amine group would give a broad peak in NMR. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H, which could be an NH2 group or something else. But 4-aminophenyl propionate would have NH2, which would show up as a broad peak, maybe at around 2-3 ppm? Or perhaps the propionate's ester group. Let me think.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester with amino group in para position. Benzoate ester would be O=C-O-Et attached to benzene, and an amino group at para. So the amino group is NH2, which would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is 2H, perhaps the ethyl group adjacent to oxygen.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) is the ethyl's CH3. The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) would be the OCH2 of the ester. So that makes sense for an ethyl ester. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That might be the NH2 from the amine. But amines typically show up as broad peaks, but if it's an amide, maybe it's different.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's check each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H5NO2. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would make it C9H10NO3? Wait, no. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Wait, no, wait. Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. No, wait, benzamide is C7H7NO2: benzene (6C) + CONH2 (2C, O, N). If it's 3-ethoxybenzamide, structure is O2N-C(O)-Ph-OEt? No, wait, benzamide is Ph-CONH2. If ethoxy is at meta, the formula would be C9H11NO3. Because benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy (C2H5O) would add 2C and 5H and 1O. So total C:7+2=9, H:7+5=12, O:2+1=3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's not matching. So option A is C9H11NO3? Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I should calculate each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Replacing a H with ethoxy (C2H5O). So the formula becomes C7 + C2 = C9, H:7-1 +5 =11, O:2+1=3, N:1. So formula is C9H11NO3. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A is not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 attached to the formamide. So the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 + HCONH2. Wait, that's C6 + C2 (from ethoxy) + C (from formamide) = C9? Let me count: ethoxy is C2H5O, phenyl is C6H5. So N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide is: C6H4(OCH2CH3)NHCOH? Hmm, wait. Alternatively, it's Ph-OCH2CH3 with the formamide group attached. So the formula would be C9H11NO3? Because formamide is O=CNH2, so O and N. Let me think: benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + formamide (CO and NH2). So O: from ethoxy (1) and formamide (2 O?), wait HCONH2 has 2 O (the carbonyl and the amide). So total O would be 1 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide) =3 O. N:1. So formula would be C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option B is also not matching.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, propionate would be CH2CH2COOH as the acid, but as the ester, it's OCH2CH2COO-. No, wait, propionate ester would be O-CO-O-R. So structure is benzene ring with para amino and propionate ester? Wait, no, the propionate would be attached as COOCH2CH2CH3? Or COO- attached to a propyl group? Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps the amino is at para, and the propionate is attached as the ester. Wait, no, the formula would be C9H11NO3. Let me calculate. 4-aminophenyl propionate: benzene (6C) + NH2 (adds 1N) + propionate (CH2CH2COO-) which is 3 C. So total C:6+3=9, H: let's see, benzene has 5H (since NH2 is attached), plus propionate's H. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the structure is PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be another structure. I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps it's PhNH2 attached to a propionate group, which is CH2CH2COO-. So the formula would be C6H5NH2-COO-R, but R is propyl. Let me count: C6 (Ph) + C3 (COOCH2CH2CH3) + N=1. So total C9? H: Ph has 5H (since NH2 is attached, so para substitution). Then, the propionate ester would have (CH2CH2COO-) which has 6 H? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. So let's see: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The formula would be C9H12N O2? Because:

PhNH2 (C6H5NH2) is C7H7N. Propionic acid is C3H6O2. So when you esterify, you get C6H5NH2-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6 + C3 + C from NH2: total C9? H: C6H5 (5 H), NH2 (2 H), COOCH2CH2CH3 has (3*2 +3) H? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C9H11NO2. Wait, the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option C's formula should be C9H11NO2. Let me check: Ph (C6H5) has 5 H. NH2 is 2 H. The propionate is (CH2CH2COO-) which is -OOC-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So when connected, it's PhNHCOOCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be a urethane. Alternatively, perhaps it's PhNH2-COOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be C6H5 (C6H5NH2) plus C3H6O2. So C6 + C3 = C9. H: 5 (Ph) +2 (NH2) + 6 (propionate) =13 H. O: 2 (from propionate). N:1. But given formula is C9H11NO2. So 13 H doesn't match. So option C may not fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzoate ester with amino group in para. So the benzene has a COOEt group and an NH2 group in para positions. Let's check the formula: Benzoate ester is PhCOOEt. Ph is C6H5, COOEt is C3H5O2. So total C6 + C3 = C9. H: Ph has 5 H (since two substituents, COOEt and NH2). COOEt has 5 H (the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which is 2+3=5 H). NH2 has 2 H. But wait, benzene with two substituents (COOEt and NH2) would have 4 H. Wait, no: para-substituted benzene has two substituents opposite each other. So each substituent takes up one position, leaving four Hs, but in two pairs. So the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So the NMR makes sense for that.

So the formula for option D: C6H5 (Ph) + COOEt (C3H5O2). So total C9, H:5 +5=10? Wait, no, COOEt is O2 and Et is C2H5. So the entire molecule is C6H5-COO-C2H5. So formula is C6 + C3 (COO) + C2 (Et) = C9. H: C6H5 has 5 H? No, because the COOEt is attached, so benzene has 4 H. Wait, no. Benzene with two substituents (COOEt and NH2) in para positions would have four H, but each as a pair (2 doublets). So H count: 4 (aromatic) + NH2 (2 H) + Et (5 H) + COOEt's O doesn't add H. So total H:4 +2 +5 =11. So formula is C9H11NO2. Because the COOEt has O2, and the NH2 has N. So yes, that matches the given formula.

Now, let's look back at the NMR. The aromatic protons are two doublets, each 2H. That fits with para substitution. So that's consistent.

The ethyl group in the ester would show up as triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH2CH3) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2). That matches the NMR.

What about the 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H)? That's the NH2 group. But wait, NH2 in the para position would typically show as a broad peak. However, in the NMR, it's a singlet. Also, amines can sometimes show as broad singlets. But wait, in the case of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 is part of the amino group attached to benzene, so it's an aniline derivative. Aniline's NH2 is usually broad, but sometimes in certain cases, it can be split or appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's a different environment.

Wait, let me think about the NMR signals again. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). If it's the NH2, but wait, NH2 usually has 2H, but the chemical shift for NH2 in aniline is around 5-6 ppm, but when it's deprotonated or in a different environment, it can vary. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm isn't NH2 but something else. Let me check the other options.

Looking at the options again, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the NH2 is on the benzene. Its NMR signal would be a singlet if it's exchanging rapidly, so it appears as a broad peak. But in the given NMR, it's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. Wait, but aniline's NH2 usually appears around 5-6 ppm. So perhaps this is something else.

Wait, let's consider the IR. The IR has strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. If it's an amide, the N-H would be around 3300-3500. But in an amine, it's lower. Wait, but in option D, it's an amine group. So for 4-aminobenzoate, the NH2 would show N-H stretches in IR around 3300-3500, which matches.

Now, the NMR's 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a singlet. For an amine, if the NH2 is in a symmetric environment, maybe it's not split. But if it's a secondary amine, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 isn't in the NMR because it's exchanged and not observed. Wait, that can happen sometimes. But in the given data, the NMR does show a peak for 2H at 4.0 ppm. So if it's the NH2, but the chemical shift doesn't fit, perhaps it's not the amine group.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is O=C(NH2)-Ph-O-Et, with Ph-O-Et in para. The formamide has an NH2 group. The IR would show N-H stretches, which it does. The NMR would have the ethoxy's CH2CH3 as triplet at 1.2, and the OCH2 as quartet at 4.5. The aromatic protons as two doublets, which fits. What about the NH2 in formamide? Formamide's NH2 would typically show up around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. But in the NMR given, there's no peak around there. Instead, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is present. So that doesn't add up. Unless the NH2 isn't visible because it's exchanging quickly or not de-shielded enough. But I'm not sure.

Option D: Does the 4.0 ppm correspond to something else? Let's think, in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the structure is PhCOOEt with NH2 in para. So the only other groups are the COOEt. The ethyl ester's OCH2CH3 would have the quartet at 4.5 and triplet at 1.2. What about the 4.0 ppm? That could be the NH2 group, but as I thought earlier, the NH2 should be around 5 ppm. So perhaps this is a problem. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not observed because it's broad and maybe in a different region, but the given NMR doesn't show a peak for it. Then why is there a 4.0 ppm peak?

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 from the ester. No, because OCH2 is usually around 4.5 ppm as a quartet, which is in the NMR. So what else could 4.0 ppm be?

Wait, what about an amide group? Amide protons can be around 7-8 ppm, but sometimes they can be deshielded differently. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group elsewhere.

Wait, looking back at the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe it's an NH group, not NH2. But in the formula, we have an amine or amide. So let's think.

Option D is an amine (NH2), so maybe it's not appearing in the NMR. Or perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but something else. Let me check the other options.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. If that's correct, the structure would be PhNH2 attached to a propionate ester. The propionate ester would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, propionate ester is O-CO-O-R where R is propyl. So the ester group would give a triplet and quartet for the CH2 groups. But in the given NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 and triplet at 1.20, which is typical for an ethyl group, not propyl.

So option C seems less likely because the ethyl group suggests an ethyl ester, not propyl.

So, going back to the options, the most likely remaining choices are B and D.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide attached to para-ethoxyphenyl.

In this structure, the formamide's NH2 would show up as a broad peak, but in the NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). Wait, formamide has two NH protons. So the NMR would have a broad peak for 2H around 8-9 ppm. But the given NMR has 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as aromatic, and 4.0 ppm as 2H. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the formamide's NH is not visible, but the main peaks are the aromatic and ester groups.

Wait, maybe the formamide's NH is not present in the NMR because it's a broad peak that's not easily visible, but the given NMR shows a 4.0 ppm peak. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 from an ether group. But in formamide, the substituents are OCH2CH3 and the formamide group. So maybe the formamide's N is attached to the phenyl. So the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 and the formamide is attached elsewhere. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the IR. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. In formamide, the carbonyl is around 1680-1700 cm-1. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit higher, more like an ester or possibly an amide. So perhaps it's more an ester than a formamide.

So if the 1720 is an ester, then option D would be more likely as the carbonyl would be from the ester.

In option D, the ester carbonyl would be around 1720, which matches. The aromatic protons are para, which fits the NMR. The ethyl ester signals are present. The 4.0 ppm peak is the NH2, but why is it at 4.0 ppm?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the NH2 is at 5 ppm. Maybe in some cases, the NH2 can be at a lower ppm. Let me check typical chemical shifts. Aniline NH2 is around 4.5-6 ppm. But if the amine is part of a conjugated system, the shift can be lower. Or perhaps the NH2 is exchanging and doesn't show up as a peak, but in this case, the NMR does show a peak. Alternatively, the 4.0 ppm could be an NH group, but that would require a secondary amine, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH in an amide. But in an amide, the NH would be around 7-8 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, another thought—what about the 4.0 ppm being something else. Could it be an OCH2 group?

Wait, no, the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 from the ester. So 4.0 could be the NH2. But the chemical shift is lower than typical.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NH group, but that would require a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2, but that's already accounted for at 4.5 as a quartet. So that can't be.

Another approach: let's think about the options' structures and their NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene with COOEt and NH2 groups in para.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H. That's in the NMR.

The ester ethyl group: triplet at 1.20 (CH2CH3) and quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). Both present.

The NH2 group: in aniline, the NH2 is usually broad and appears around 5-6 ppm. But in the given NMR, there's a peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad). So this is a bit of a problem. Unless...

Wait, perhaps the NH2 is not present. But in option D, it's present. Maybe the NH2 is exchanging rapidly and not observed, but then why is there a peak at 4.0? Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm isn't the NH2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH group in an amide. But option D isn't an amide. Wait, the options don't have an amide except option A and B.

Wait, maybe I messed up the options. Let me look again.

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: benzamide with ethoxy in meta.

IR: N-H (amide) would have peaks around 3300. Carbonyl around 1680-1700. So the IR in the question has 1720, which is higher, more like an ester. So perhaps this is less likely.

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: formamide has a CONH2 group. The carbonyl would be around 1700, maybe a bit higher. The IR given is 1720, which could fit. The NMR would have the ethoxy's triplet and quartet. The aromatic protons as two doublets. But the formamide's NH2 would appear as a broad peak around 8-9 ppm, which isn't in the given NMR. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 of the formamide, but that's in a different environment. Maybe if it's an aromatic amine, the NH2 could be downfield, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NCH2 group, but that doesn't make sense.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about each option's structure and how the NMR would look.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Ester: OCOOEt. So the ester's OCH2 would be at 4.5 (q), triplet for CH2CH3 at 1.20.

Aromatic: para substitution, two doublets at 7 and 8 ppm. Correct.

NH2: in para position. Aniline NH2 typically broad, around 5-6 ppm. But the given NMR has a 4.0 ppm peak for 2H. So that might be a problem. Unless the NH2 is not visible.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm isn't NH2 but something else. But what else? Maybe it's an NH in an amide, but the structure isn't an amide.

Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is not visible because it's in a different environment or because it's exchanging and not showing up clearly. But the NMR does show a peak at 4.0, so perhaps it's another group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, but that shouldn't be the case because we've already accounted for the ester's OCH2 at 4.5.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, but in this case, it's shifted down because of the adjacent substituents. For example, if the amino group is part of an aromatic ring (like an aniline), its NH2 might appear at a slightly lower ppm than usual. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2 but another group. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data: the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. If it's not NH2, what else could give a broad singlet of 2H? Maybe an NH in an amide? But none of the options except A and B are amides.

Option A is a benzamide, so it has an NH2 group. But in that case, the IR would have strong N-H bands. The NMR would have the NH2 as a broad peak, but I'm not sure where.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group, but that's already accounted for in the ester at 4.5.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH in a secondary amine, but the formula doesn't suggest that; all options have either primary amines or amides.

Another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, but in an ether or something else. But in this case, the ester's OCH2 is already at 4.5.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NH group from an amide, but the options only have B as a formamide and A as a benzamide.

In option B, N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide: the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 attached to a formamide group (HCONH2). So the NMR would have ethoxy's triplet (1.20) and quartet (4.5). The aromatic protons as two doublets (7 and 8 ppm). The formamide's NH2 would typically be a broad peak around 8-9 ppm, but it's not present in the given NMR. Instead, there's a peak at 4.0 (2H). So that doesn't align.

Hmm. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let me consider the integration of the NMR signals. The aromatic part is 2H + 2H. The ethyl ester is 3H and 2H. The 4.0 ppm is 2H. So that adds up to 2+2+3+2=9 H. Wait, the molecular formula has 11 H. So I'm missing 2 H. Oh, wait, the aromatic in the given NMR is 2H +2H=4H. The ethyl groups are 3H +2H=5H. The 4.0 ppm is 2H. So total H in NMR is 4+5+2=11 H. That matches the formula. So each H is accounted for.

So, the 4.0 ppm is 2H. If it's not NH2, what else? Let me think about the structure of each option.

Option D: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is Ph-COO-Et with NH2 in para. The NH2 is 2H. So the NMR must account for those 2H. But where? They should be in the NMR. If they're not visible, perhaps it's because of exchange or splitting, but the given data shows a peak at 4.0. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2. But earlier, I thought aniline's NH2 is around 5 ppm. Maybe in this case, it's shifted down.

Wait, maybe the substituents are affecting the chemical shift. The ester group is electron-withdrawing, which could deshield the NH2, making it appear at a lower ppm. Or maybe it's the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is not deshielded and appears at 4.0.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is D, despite the chemical shift discrepancy.

Alternatively, let's think about the options again. The IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is more consistent with an ester than an amide or formamide. So option D is an ester, which fits the 1720 IR. The NMR for the ester groups matches. The aromatic protons fit para substitution. The NH2 would then be the 4.0 ppm peak.

But wait, in reality, aniline's NH2 usually appears around 5-6 ppm. So if the given data has a peak at 4.0 ppm, perhaps it's not an aniline NH2 but something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH in a secondary amide. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but a CH2 group somewhere else. But all CH2 groups are accounted for: ethyl ester's CH2CH3 and OCH2. There's also the aromatic CH groups.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH in an amine, but that would require a secondary amine.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the N-H in an amide. Let me think about amides. In an amide, the NH would be around 7-8 ppm, but sometimes in certain cases, it can be downfield or upfield. But in the given NMR, the aromatic signals are at 7 and 8, so the 4.0 ppm is not an amide NH.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. Let's check the options for the presence of an amine or amide.

Options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: amide group (NH2).

B) formamide: amide group (NH2).

C) 4-aminophenyl propionate: amine group (NH2).

D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate: amine group (NH2).

So all options have either an amide or amine, which explains the IR peaks.

The NMR shows a peak at 4.0 ppm (2H, broad). If it's an amide, the peak would be around 7-8, which isn't the case. So perhaps it's an amine.

Aniline's NH2 is around 5-6 ppm. So the 4.0 ppm is a bit low. Maybe it's a different substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH2 is split into a singlet due to symmetry, but it's still around 5 ppm. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the N-H in a secondary amine, but according to the options, only option C is a primary amine.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not N-H but O-H. But esters don't have O-H. Unless it's a free acid, but the formula is an ester.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to make a decision based on the data.

The ester's NMR matches option D. The only issue is the 4.0 ppm peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the NH2. Maybe the NH2 isn't showing up because it's broad and not integrated well, but the data says it's 2H. So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not the NH2.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH from a different group. Let me think again: none of the other options seem to fit as well as D.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH group from an amide. Let's think about option B again. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide has a formamide group, NH2. The IR would have NH peaks around 3400. The NMR would have the ethoxy signals, aromatic, and the formamide's NH2. But the given NMR doesn't show a peak for NH2. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH in the formamide. Wait, formamide's NH2 is a CONH2 group. So the protons would be on the NH2. In the NMR, they usually appear around 8-9 ppm as a broad peak. But there's nothing in the given NMR in that region. So option B is unlikely.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D, despite the 4.0 ppm peak not fitting the expected NH2 shift. Maybe in this case, the NH2 is appearing at 4.0 ppm, perhaps due to the substituents' electronic effects or ring current effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not NH2 but an NH in a different environment.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the amide's NH in option B. But earlier thought says that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from a coupling with another group.

Another approach: let's think about the molecular formula and the options again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Formula is C9H11NO2.

Yes, that matches.

The NMR:

1.20 (t, 3H) – ethyl CH3.

4.5 (q, 2H) – OCH2.

4.0 (bs, 2H) – ?

Aromatic at 7.0 and 8.0 (d, 2H each) – para substitution.

So what's left is the NH2. But where is it?

Unless the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, but the chemical shift is lower than usual.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an NH group. But for that, the structure should have a secondary amine, which none of the options have.

Hmm. I think I might need to make a choice here. The best fit seems to be option D, despite the 4.0 ppm discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2, and the shift is lower because of the electron-withdrawing ester group.

So, I'll go with option D.


The compound to identify is C9H11NO2, and the spectroscopic data provided includes IR and 1H NMR. The IR shows strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, indicative of N-H stretching, and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, consistent with a carbonyl group. The 1H NMR data includes signals at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H), 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), 4.5 ppm (q, 2H), 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). These signals suggest an ethyl group, a carbonyl group, and a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This compound contains an amide group and an ethoxy group in the meta position. However, the NMR data shows para-substitution on the aromatic ring (two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), which does not match the meta substitution expected for this compound. Additionally, the molecular formula of this compound would be C9H11NO3, which does not match the given formula C9H11NO2.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This compound contains a formamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group in the para position. The IR data matches the amide N-H stretching, and the NMR shows para-substitution on the aromatic ring. However, the formamide NH2 group typically appears as a broad peak around 8-9 ppm, which is absent in the given NMR data. Instead, the NMR shows a peak at 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H), which does not align with the expected signals for this compound.  
   **Eliminated.**

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This compound contains an amino group (NH2) and a propionate ester. The molecular formula of this compound would be C9H12NO2, which does not match the given formula C9H11NO2. Additionally, the NMR data does not show signals consistent with a propyl group (e.g., a triplet at ~1.7 ppm and a quartet at ~4.2 ppm).  
   **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This compound contains an ethyl ester group, a carbonyl group, and an amino group (NH2) in the para position on the aromatic ring. The IR data matches the ester carbonyl at 1720 cm⁻¹, and the NMR shows signals consistent with an ethyl ester (1.20 ppm, t, 3H and 4.5 ppm, q, 2H). The aromatic protons appear as two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with para-substitution. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) signal could correspond to the NH2 group, which may appear downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the ester group. This compound matches both the molecular formula C9H11NO2 and the spectroscopic data.  
   **Correct.**

### Conclusion:
The compound that best fits the given spectroscopic data and molecular formula is **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**.

**Answer: D**
