Okay, so I've got this nuclear decay question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says that a decay converts two nucleons of flavor A into two of flavor B, while emitting particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The energy spectrum of E is continuous, which I remember has an endpoint Q. So for E, the energy can vary from zero up to Q.

Now, there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is, how does the energy spectrum of E change in this case? The options are about whether the spectrum becomes discrete or remains continuous, and whether the endpoint increases or decreases.

Hmm. I think I need to consider conservation laws here—like energy and momentum. In the original decay, when two E and two V are emitted, each E and V would carry some energy and momentum. But when replacing two V's with a single M (which is massless), that might change things.

Wait, let's think about the original case first. The total energy and momentum must be conserved. The E particles are probably electrons or positrons, but since they're called E and V, maybe they're electrons and neutrinos, but not sure. Wait, no, in beta decay, for example, you have a beta particle (electron) and an antineutrino. But this case is a bit different because it's emitting two E and two V.

Wait, in the original decay, E and V are lighter particles. So in the original scenario, when two E and two V are emitted, each pair would carry energy. The continuous spectrum of E suggests that the energy isn't fixed, which is typical in beta decay when a neutrino (or antineutrino) is emitted because the energy can vary, but the sum is fixed.

But when you change the decay to emit a single M instead of two V, how does that affect the E particles?

Wait, the new decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. M is massless and exotic. So M would have zero mass, so its energy is equal to its momentum (E = |p|c, since for massless particles, energy is pc).

In the original case, two V's are emitted. Let's
