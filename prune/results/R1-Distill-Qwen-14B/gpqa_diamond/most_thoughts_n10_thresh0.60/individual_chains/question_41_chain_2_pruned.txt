Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Alright, I remember that when objects move relative to each other, you have to consider the effects of special relativity, especially when dealing with light.

Wait, the problem states that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. Wait, no, wait, same direction as the beam, but toward the observer. Wait, no, the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. Oh, wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read.

Ah, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit conflicting. If the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, but the glass is moving toward the observer, then the beam must be moving towards the observer as well. Or perhaps I'm getting the directions wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of frames of reference. The lab frame is the observer's frame. The glass is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So, the light beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Or wait, perhaps the light is moving in the direction of the glass's motion. But the glass is moving toward the observer? Wait, that doesn
