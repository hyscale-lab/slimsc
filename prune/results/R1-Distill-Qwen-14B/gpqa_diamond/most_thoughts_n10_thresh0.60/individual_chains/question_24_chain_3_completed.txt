Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step.

Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The question is about two mixtures, X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. Here's what I understand:

1. Mixture X is an equimolar mix of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, bromine water decolorization usually implies the presence of double bonds, since alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine, causing it to decolorize. Since the mixture X is two liquids, they must each have double bonds.

2. When mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar. Importantly, Y does not decolorize bromine water. Since Y doesn't react with bromine, it must not have any double bonds. But wait, what kind of reaction is happening here? Oh, right, the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element is both oxidized and reduced. So, in X, perhaps each component has some unsaturated bonds that, upon reaction with Pt (which is a catalyst), undergo a change.

3. Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. And Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is used as a solvent. Since Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be a fully saturated molecule, like an alkane. Because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions, but maybe under severe conditions, like high pressure and temperature, they might, but in this case, Z doesn't react further, so it's already saturated.

So, let's figure out what Z is first. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate the molecular formula of Z.

Hydrogen percentage is 14.28% → 14.28% is approximately 1/7, which is about 14.2857%. So, perhaps Z is a hydrocarbon where the mass contributed by hydrogen is 1/7 of the total. Let's compute.

Let the formula of Z be CnH2m. Wait, no, for a hydrocarbon, it's either CnH2m (alkene or alkyne) or CnH2m+2 (alkane). Since Z is a constituent of Y, which doesn't have any double bonds (as Y doesn't decolorize bromine), Z must be an alkane. So formula is CnH2n+2.

The mass of hydrogen is 14.28% of Z's molar mass. So:

Hydrogen's mass in Z = ( (2n+2) * 1 ) / (12n + (2n+2) ) ) = 14.28% → 0.1428.

Let me compute that:

(2n + 2) / (12n + 2n + 2) ) = 0.1428

Simplify denominator: 14n + 2.

So, (2n+2)/(14n+2) = 0.1428.

Multiplying both sides by denominator:

2n + 2 = 0.1428 * (14n + 2)

Let me compute 0.1428 * 14n: 0.1428 *14 = 2. So 2n.

0.1428 * 2 = 0.2856.

So, 2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856

Subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856 → Wait, that can't be right. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.1428 * (14n + 2) = 2n + 2.

Wait, wait, perhaps I did the cross multiplication wrong. Let's re-calculate.

(2n + 2) = 0.1428 * (14n + 2)

Let me compute 0.1428 *14n: 14 * 0.1428 ≈ 2. So 2n.

0.1428 *2 = 0.2856.

So, 2n + 2 = 2n + 0.2856.

Subtract 2n from both sides:

2 = 0.2856 → This can't be right. That suggests 2 equals approximately 0.2856, which is impossible. Maybe I messed up the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should set it up differently. Let me let M be the molar mass of Z.

Hydrogen's mass is (2n+2)*1 g/mol.

Total mass M = (12n) + (2n+2) ) = 14n +2.

Hydrogen mass fraction: (2n + 2) / (14n + 2) = 0.1428.

So, (2n + 2) = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to eliminate decimals:

(2n +2)*1000 = 142.8*(14n +2)

But perhaps better to solve algebraically.

(2n + 2) = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to eliminate the decimal:

1000*(2n +2) = 142.8*(14n + 2)

But maybe a better approach is to compute 0.1428 as approximately 1/7. So 1/7 = 0.142857.

So, (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying: 7*(2n+2) = 1*(14n +2)

14n +14 =14n +2.

Subtract 14n from both sides: 14 =2 → 14=2? That's impossible. Hmm, that suggests an error in my setup.

Alternatively, maybe Z is not an alkane but something else. Wait, but the problem says Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, it's fully saturated. So, it must be an alkane. So, the formula is CnH2n+2.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me try again.

Let's let's compute the fraction:

Hydrogen mass is (2n +2) / (12n + (2n +2)) ) = 14.28%

So,

(2n + 2) / (14n +2) ) = 0.1428

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 to keep it simple:

Let me plug in some small values for n and see if it fits.

n=1: (4)/(16) = 0.25 → 25% → too high.

n=2: (6)/(30)=0.2 → 20% → still higher than 14.28.

n=3: (8)/(44) → 8/44 ≈ 0.1818 → 18.18% → getting closer.

n=4: (10)/(58) → 10/58 ≈ 0.1724 → 17.24% → still higher.

n=5: 12/(72)= 0.1667 → 16.67% → higher.

n=6: 14/(86)≈0.1628 → 16.28%→ higher.

Wait, but 14.28% is lower. What if I try n=6:

Wait, perhaps I need to think of a fraction that equals 1/7. Let me see:

14.28% is approximately 1/7. So, (2n+2)/(14n +2) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by (14n+2) *7:

7*(2n+2) =14n +2 → 14n +14 =14n +2 → 14=2? No, same issue.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the structure is different. Or perhaps Z is a different type of hydrocarbon but with no hydrogen in the molecule? No, that can't be, because it's a hydrocarbon.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. The molar mass of Z is 12n + (2n +2) = 14n +2.

Hydrogen contributes (2n +2) g/mol, which is 14.28% of the total.

So,

(2n + 2) = 0.1428*(14n +2)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to eliminate decimals:

(2n +2)*1000 = 142.8*(14n +2)

But perhaps it's easier to set it up as:

(2n +2) = (14n +2) * (1/7)

Because 1/7 is ≈0.1428.

So,

(2n +2) = (14n +2)/7

Multiply both sides by 7:

7*(2n +2) =14n +2 → 14n +14 =14n +2 → 14=2 → Hmm, same problem.

Wait, that suggests there's no solution, which can't be right. So, perhaps I'm incorrect in the formula of Z. Maybe Z isn't CnH2n+2 but something else.

Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane, so the formula is CnH2n. Let me see.

If Z is CnH2n, then H contributes (2n) g/mol.

Molar mass is 12n +2n =14n.

Hydrogen fraction: (2n)/(14n) )= 1/7 ≈14.28%. Oh! So that's it.

Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7, so (2n)/(14n) = 1/7 → 2n/(14n)=1/7 → yes. So, that's correct.

So, Z is a cycloalkane, because for a cycloalkane, the formula is CnH2n. Alternatively, it could be a single ring without any double bonds.

Wait, but wait. Hydrogenation of X gives Z, and X contains two liquids with double bonds. So, when X is hydrogenated, the double bonds are saturated. But mixture Y is formed via a reaction of X with Pt and heat, and Y's hydrogenation gives the same Z.

Wait, the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives Z. So, perhaps X and Y, when hydrogenated, both form Z.

So, let me think about X and Y.

Mixture X is two liquids that decolorize bromine. So, X's components have double bonds (alkenes or alkynes). They undergo a reaction with Pt and heat to form Y.

The reaction when X is treated with Pt and heat is a disproportionation, so each component in X must be a substance that can disproportionates.

Wait, but what's a common reaction where a mixture of two compounds undergoes disproportionation with Pt?

Wait, think about alkenes. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a di-substituted alkene which, under certain conditions, can undergo a reaction leading to breaking of the double bond.

Wait, but another possibility is that the starting compounds in X are allenes or something else that can split into two different products upon hydrogenation or some other reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the mixture X is made of two alkenes that undergo hydrogenation to form alkanes, but that can't be because hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is an alkane. But wait, if X is a mixture of two alkenes, hydrogenation would produce two alkanes. But according to the problem, hydrogenating X gives only Z, which suggests that both components of X, when hydrogenated, give the same Z. How is that possible?

Hmm, perhaps X is made of two different alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give the same alkane. But that's not possible unless they are isomers that hydrogenate to the same product. For example, perhaps X contains two different alkenes that upon hydrogenation give the same alkane.

Wait, but for example, suppose X has 1-butene and 2-butene. Hydrogenating each would give butane. But wait, 1-butene and 2-butene are different alkenes, but each would hydrogenate to butane. So, if X is a mixture of 1- and 2-butene, then hydrogenation would yield butane.

But in this problem, X is a mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps each component in X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation gives the same alkane.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes which, upon hydrogenation, produce the same product. For example, if X has 1-pentene and 2-pentene, they would each hydrogenate to pentane.

But then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, what happens? If X is a mixture of two alkenes, treatment with Pt and heat might cause some isomerization or addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not hydrogenation but something else, like dehydrohalogenation or a rearrangement.

Wait, the problem says that treating X with Pt and heat gives Y, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine. So Y has no double bonds, as it doesn't react with bromine.

Wait, but let's think about the nature of Y. Since Y's components don't have double bonds, and Y comes from X via a disproportionation reaction, perhaps Y's components are alkanes or other saturated compounds.

Wait, but we know that Z is a constituent of Y. So Y has Z as one of its components. But Y is a mixture of two liquids, so Z must be one of them, and the other component is another substance.

Wait, but the problem states that hydrogenation of Y gives only Z. So, perhaps Y is a mixture of Z and another component that, upon hydrogenation, also gives Z. But that would imply that both components in Y are identical, which can't be the case because Y is a mixture of two liquids. Alternatively, maybe Y's other component is Z itself, but that's not possible as it's a mixture of two different liquids.

Wait, maybe I'm getting mixed up here. Let me try to restate the problem.

Hydrogenation of X and Y both give only Z. So, X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z.

So, X is a mixture of two alkenes. Hydrogenation of each leads to Z, which is an alkane with formula CnH2n (since we found that its H% is 14.28% → so (2n)/(14n) = 1/7 → n= any number, but let's find n.

Wait, earlier I thought Z's formula was CnH2n, since the H% is (2n)/(14n) = 1/7 ≈14.28%. So, n can be any number, but Z is a hydrocarbon used as a solvent. Common solvents like cyclohexane (C6H12), which is a cycloalkane. But wait, the formula for cyclohexane is C6H12, which is C6H12 → H% is (12)/(72 +12) = 12/84 = 1/7 ≈14.28%. So Z is cyclohexane.

Wait, wait: let me compute.

For cyclohexane, C6H12.

Molar mass: 6*12 +12 =72+12=84 g/mol.

Hydrogen mass:12 g/mol.

Hydrogen percentage: 12/84 = 0.142857 → 14.2857%, which matches the given value. So Z is cyclohexane, formula C6H12.

So, Z is cyclohexane.

Now, when X is hydrogenated, it produces only Z. So each component in X, upon hydrogenation, gives Z. So each component in X must be an alkene that, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but alkenes when hydrogenated produce alkanes. So if Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), which is a cycloalkane, hydrogenation of X's components must produce cyclohexane. So, what alkenes would hydrogenate to cyclohexane?

Wait, cyclohexane is a cycloalkane. If you hydrogenate a cyclohexene (C6H10), you get cyclohexane. So, for example, if X contains cyclohexene, then hydrogenation would produce cyclohexane. But X is a mixture of two liquids, both of which, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkenes that each hydrogenate to cyclohexane, that would mean that both alkenes are cyclohexene, which can't be because they'd be the same compound. So perhaps the alkenes in X are such that both, upon hydrogenation, give cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are alkenes that are not cyclic but, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of a non-cyclic alkene would give an alkane with a longer chain if it's a cyclic product.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are dienes? Or maybe they are allenes, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe X's components are not alkenes but something else that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X's components are benzene rings, but benzene upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But benzene is a liquid at room temperature? No, benzene is a liquid but when hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane, which is a liquid as well. Wait, but the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids. So maybe X contains two different aromatic compounds that, upon hydrogenation, produce cyclohexane.

Wait, but benzene is a single compound. So if X is a mixture of two different aromatic compounds, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane, that would imply both are benzene, which can't be the case. So perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of X. X's components are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. So each must be a cyclohexene isomer, but cyclohexene is a single structure. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe X's components are not alkenes but something else that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. Like maybe 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a diene, and perhaps when hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. Similarly, another diene might form the same product.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to approach this differently.

We know that Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction from X. So, each component in X undergoes disproportionation to form two different products in Y.

Wait, but no. The problem says that X is treated with Pt and heated, leading to Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids formed via disproportionation. So perhaps each component in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form two different components in Y.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two alkenes, perhaps each undergoes a reaction that breaks the double bond in a way that produces two different products. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is such that each component in X is a diene, and upon treatment with Pt and heat, it undergoes a reaction that transforms it into two different alkanes. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but another angle: since Y's components don't have double bonds (they don't decolorize bromine), and Y is formed via a reaction where X's components (which do have double bonds) split into two products each. So, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene which, upon reaction, splits into two alkanes.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is an alkene that, upon addition of hydrogen (but without being hydrogenated), breaks into two smaller alkanes. But I'm not exactly sure what reaction that would be.

Alternatively, think about the possibility that X's components are allenes (cumulenes), which can undergo [2+2] cycloaddition or other reactions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclic alkenes, such as cyclopropane? No, cyclopropane is a strained alkene. But when treated with Pt and heat, perhaps it undergoes ring-opening to form something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the specific case where X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon treatment with Pt and heat undergoes a reaction to form two products, leading to Y being a mixture of these products.

Wait, but the problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation, which is a type of reaction where a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So, each component in X must be a species that can undergo disproportion.

So, perhaps each component in X is a tri-substituted or more substituted alkene that can undergo a [2+2] addition, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the breaking of the double bond into two single bonds, with some hydrogen addition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure of X's components.

Since both components in X are alkenes, and when hydrogenated (with Pt under severe conditions), they give cyclohexane (Z).

So, each component in X must be an alkene that, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane. So, each must be an alkene whose structure, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane.

Wait, but cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So, the alkenes in X must have a structure that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. So the alkenes in X would be cyclohexene, but cyclohexene is a single structure. So, perhaps X has two different isomers of cyclohexene, but that's not possible because cyclohexene doesn't have structural isomers (except perhaps for cis and trans, but those are the same upon hydrogenation).

Wait, but maybe the alkenes in X are not cyclic. Let's think of a non-cyclic alkene that, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane. That doesn't make sense because hydrogenation of a non-cyclic alkene would give an alkane with a straight chain, not a ring.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a ring. For example, benzene is a ring with three double bonds. But hydrogenating benzene gives cyclohexane. So, if X is a mixture of two different aromatic compounds that upon hydrogenation give cyclohexane, that could fit.

Wait, but benzene is a single compound. So, perhaps X is a mixture of two different rings, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But that's not feasible because each ring would have to hydrogenate to the same product, which would require that each is a different ring structure that, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane. But I can't think of two different rings that would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not rings but are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane. For example, suppose each component is a di-substituted alkene that, upon hydrogenation, forms a six-carbon alkane with a ring. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps X's components are not simple alkenes. Let me think about the possibility that each component in X is a cumulene (allene) or another type of unsaturated compound that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a larger structure that, when hydrogenated, forms a ring. For example, if X contains 1,3-pentadiene, which upon hydrogenation could form cyclohexane via some cyclization, but I'm not certain.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach from another angle.

We know that Y is a mixture of two liquids formed via a disproportionation reaction from X. Since Y doesn't contain double bonds, and each component of Y upon hydrogenation gives Z (cyclohexane), then each component in Y must be an alkane that can't react with bromine, hence no double bonds.

So, Y has two alkanes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives Z. Wait, but Z is already an alkane. So, if Y's components are alkanes, then hydrogenating them would not change them, which contradicts the problem statement. Because the problem says hydrogenating Y gives Z, implying that Y's components are unsaturated and, when hydrogenated, become Z. But earlier I thought Y doesn't have double bonds. Wait, but the problem says Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which would mean Y has no double bonds. So Y must be a mixture of alkanes, but then how can hydrogenation of Y give Z? Unless Y's components are alkynes, but alkynes would decolorize bromine.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction when X is treated with Pt and heated. Y is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine. So Y has no double bonds or triple bonds, or else it would decolorize bromine.

Wait, but wait, if Y's components are alkanes, then hydrogenation of Y (which is already alkanes) would not produce anything. But according to the problem, hydrogenating Y gives Z. So perhaps Y's components are alkenes, but that contradicts the earlier statement that Y doesn't decolorize bromine.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that Y doesn't contain double bonds. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says that Y does not decolorize bromine water. So Y has no double bonds. So Y must be a mixture of alkanes.

But then, how can Y's hydrogenation produce Z? Because alkanes don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions. So perhaps the problem statement is indicating that hydrogenation of Y is under rather severe conditions, which might allow some reaction, but in this case, Z is the result. Wait, but if Y is a mixture of alkanes, then hydrogenation of Y wouldn't change anything. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps my initial conclusion about Z being cyclohexane is incorrect. Let me re-examine that.

Earlier, I thought Z's formula is CnH2n because that gives a hydrogen mass fraction of 14.28%, which is 1/7. Let me check for n=6.

C6H12: 6*12=72, 12*1=12 → total 84. 12/84=0.1428 → yes, correct.

So Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12.

Now, X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane. So each component in X must be an alkene that hydrogenates to cyclohexane. So, what alkenes would that be?

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are cyclohexene derivatives. Let me think: cyclohexene is C6H10. When hydrogenated, it becomes C6H12 (cyclohexane). So, if X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane, perhaps those alkenes are isomers of cyclohexene.

But wait, cyclohexene doesn't have structural isomers; it's a single structure. So, perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another di-substituted alkene that also, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane. But I can't think of any other alkenes that would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the alkenes in X are not cyclic. Let's consider non-cyclic alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane. For example, suppose one of the alkenes in X is 1,3-cyclohexadiene. Hydrogenating that would add two H2 molecules, turning the two double bonds into single bonds, forming cyclohexane. But 1,3-cyclohexadiene is a conjugated diene, and hydrogenation would give cyclohexane.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of two dienes, each with a different structure, and both hydrogenating to cyclohexane, then that could fit. But I'm not sure if such dienes exist.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, give cyclohexane. But that doesn't make sense because mono-alkenes would hydrogenate to alkanes with the same number of carbons, but cyclohexane is a ring, not a straight chain.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a ring. For example, suppose X contains 1,3-cyclopentadiene and another cyclic diene. Upon hydrogenation, each would add H2 across the double bonds to form cyclohexane. But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but something else. Wait, maybe X contains two different allenes (cumulenes) that, upon hydrogenation, give cyclohexane.

But this is getting too speculative. Let me try to think about the possible structure of X and Y.

Since Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction from X, perhaps each component in X is a molecule that can split into two different products. For example, maybe X's components are all the same molecule, but the problem says X is a mixture of two liquids. So, perhaps each component in X is undergoing a different disproportionation reaction to form two different products in Y.

Wait, but that's not matching the problem statement. The problem says that treating X with Pt and heat results in a mixture Y of two other liquids from a disproportionation reaction.

So perhaps each component in X undergoes a disproportionation reaction, splitting into two different components, leading to Y being a mixture of the two products.

Wait, but that would require that each component in X is a compound that can undergo a disproportionation reaction. For example, if X contains a compound with a double bond that can split into two alkanes.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a geminal dihalide or something else that can split upon heating. Alternatively, perhaps each component is a ketone or an alcohol that can undergo some decomposition. But that's a stretch.

Wait, maybe X's components are alkenes with a certain structure that, upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergo a cleavage to form two alkanes. For example, if X contains an internal di-substituted alkene, perhaps it can split into two smaller alkanes. But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is such that each component in X is an alkene that, upon treatment with Pt and heat, adds hydrogen across the double bond in a way that breaks the molecule into two parts. But that doesn't sound familiar.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another approach: Let's consider that each component in X is an alkene that, upon hydrogenation, gives cyclohexane. So, each component in X must have a structure that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. For example:

If X is a mixture of two alkenes, each with the formula C6H10, then their hydrogenation would produce C6H12 (cyclohexane). So, perhaps the alkenes are different isomers of cyclohexene.

Wait, but cyclohexene doesn't have different isomers except cis and trans, which upon hydrogenation would give the same product. So, if X is a mixture of cis and trans cyclohexene, then hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. But that would mean X is a single compound, not a mixture of two. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps X contains two different alkenes that are structural isomers. For example, 1-hexene and 2-hexene. Upon hydrogenation, both would give hexane, but that's a straight-chain alkane, not cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the alkenes in X are such that upon hydrogenation, they form cyclohexane through some ring-forming process, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are not alkenes but something else, like allenes or other unsaturated compounds. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the problem again.

Mixture X is two alkenes. Each, when hydrogenated, gives cyclohexane. So, each must be a cyclohexene derivative. Let's think of the structure of cyclohexene: it's a six-membered ring with one double bond. So, when hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane.

So, perhaps X is a mixture of two different diastereomers of cyclohexene. But then, each would hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But that would make X a single compound, not a mixture of two.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X's components are two different alkenes that are not rings but when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane via some cyclization. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclopentene and another cyclic diene. When hydrogenated, cyclopentene becomes cyclopentane, but that doesn't give cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

This is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should try to think about the possible structures of X and Y.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. X is a mixture of two alkenes → when hydrogenated, each gives cyclohexane (Z).

2. When X is treated with Pt and heat, a disproportionation occurs, leading to Y, which is a mixture of two alkanes (since Y doesn't have double bonds).

3. Hydrogenation of Y gives Z (cyclohexane), which implies that Y's components must have some unsaturation. But earlier we thought Y has no double bonds. This is a contradiction.

Wait, no. If Y doesn't have double bonds, then hydrogenation of Y wouldn't change anything. So how can Y, upon hydrogenation, give Z (cyclohexane)?

This suggests that Y must have some unsaturation, like triple bonds, which would allow hydrogenation. But the problem states that Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which would happen if Y has double bonds. So if Y has triple bonds, it might not decolorize bromine as quickly as alkenes, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Y contains aromatic rings, which don't decolorize bromine as readily but can undergo hydrogenation. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Y contains alkynes. Alkynes can decolorize bromine water, but perhaps under certain conditions, they don't. Or perhaps the reaction conditions are such that Y's triple bonds don't react with bromine under the given conditions.

Wait, but the problem says Y does not decolorize bromine, so Y must not have any double or triple bonds. So Y must be a mixture of alkanes. But then, how can hydrogenation of Y give Z (cyclohexane)?

This is a contradiction. The only way this makes sense is if Y's components are not alkanes but some other unsaturated compounds that don't react with bromine. But I'm not aware of any such compounds.

Wait, perhaps Y's components are alkanes, but Z is an alkane that is a hydrogenation product of Y, which can't happen. So perhaps my earlier assumption that Z is cyclohexane is incorrect.

Wait, let me re-examine the hydrogen percentage calculation.

Hydrogen mass is 14.28%, which is 1/7.

So, H mass = 1/7 of Z's molar mass.

So, Molar mass of Z: 12n + 2m = M.

Hydrogen mass: 2m = (1/7) M → 2m = (1/7)(12n + 2m).

Multiply both sides by 7: 14m =12n +2m → 12n =12m → n = m.

So, the formula of Z is CnH2n (if it's a cycloalkane) or CnH2m where m =n, so CnH2n.

Therefore, Z has the formula CnH2n.

Which matches cyclohexane (n=6).

So, Z is definitely cyclohexane.

Thus, the components of X must be alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane.

So each component in X is an alkene with the formula C6H10.

But wait, alkenes have the formula CnH2n. So if Z is C6H12, which is 2n+2 for n=6, so that's an alkane. So, the alkenes in X have the formula C6H10, which is 2n for n=6 → that's a cyclohexene.

Therefore, X must be a mixture of two different alkenes, each with the formula C6H10. But cyclohexene is a single structure. So perhaps X is a mixture of two different di-substituted cyclohexenes, but I don't think such isomers exist beyond cis and trans, which upon hydrogenation would produce the same cyclohexane.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes that are not cyclic but, upon hydrogenation, form cyclohexane. But I don't see how that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains two different alkenes, each with six carbons, that are not cyclic and, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane. But that would require that each alkene has a structure that, upon hydrogenation, cyclizes into a ring. I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a ring but have double bonds that are in positions that allow them to form cyclohexane upon hydrogenation. For example, if X contains 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But that's a diene, so perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes, each of which upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

But then, each diene would have two double bonds, and hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules. So, for example, if X contains 1,3-cyclohexadiene and another diene, each upon hydrogenation would produce cyclohexane.

But this is getting too speculative. Let's try to think about the possible structures.

If each component in X is C6H10, then they are alkenes with six carbons. The possible structures are cyclohexene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, etc. But hydrogenating 1-hexene would give hexane, which is a straight-chain alkane, not cyclohexane.

So, perhaps the alkenes in X are cyclic. So, X is a mixture of two different cyclic alkenes, each with six carbons, that when hydrogenated give cyclohexane.

But cyclohexene is the only six-membered cyclic alkene. So, perhaps X isn't a mixture of two different alkenes but of two molecules of cyclohexene. But the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids, implying two different compounds.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two different diastereomers of cyclohexene, but that's unlikely to be two different liquids.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different mono-alkenes, each with a structure that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But I can't think of any.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are part of a larger molecule that, upon hydrogenation, forms a ring. But I don't have enough information.

At this point, perhaps I should accept that the alkenes in X are cyclohexene and another isomer, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to think about the total number of hydrogen atoms in X's components.

The question is asking for the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Each liquid is an alkene, so their formulas are C6H10 each, perhaps. So, each has 10 H atoms. So, two liquids would have 20 H atoms in total. But looking at the options, 22 is an option (C). But wait, 20 isn't an option here. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps each component in X has 11 H atoms, but that doesn't fit the alkene formula.

Wait, wait, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted cyclohexene, which would have the formula C6H10. So each has 10 H atoms. Two components would have 20 H atoms in total, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes have more H atoms. Wait, perhaps each component is a tri-substituted or more substituted alkene. For example, 1,3-cyclohexadiene would have two double bonds and thus fewer H atoms. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a different structural isomer of C6H10, but I'm not sure if that's possible beyond cis and trans cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X have more than six carbons. Let me think: if Z is C6H12, then the alkenes in X must have the same number of carbons as Z, since hydrogenation adds H2. So X's alkenes would be C6H10.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a different di-substituted alkene with six carbons. For example, 1-hexene and 2-hexene. Each upon hydrogenation would give hexane, but that's a straight-chain alkane, not cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about the reaction that forms Y.

X is treated with Pt and heat, leading to Y via a disproportionation reaction. So, each component in X undergoes a disproportionation, splitting into two different products.

Wait, but what's a common disproportionation reaction involving alkenes? Hmm. Maybe the breaking of the double bond into two single bonds, adding H2O or H2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps each component in X is a tri-substituted alkene that, when heated with Pt, undergoes a reaction to form two alkanes. For example, suppose X's components are alkenes that, upon reaction, break into two smaller alkanes.

For example, suppose X contains 1,3-pentadiene. When treated with Pt and heat, it could split into two smaller alkanes. But I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted alkene that, upon reaction, forms two alkanes via a process that adds H2 across the double bond in a way that splits the molecule.

But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are such that each can be oxidized and reduced at the same time, leading to two different products. For example, a compound with a double bond and an adjacent functional group that can undergo both oxidation and reduction.

But again, I'm not certain.

At this point, perhaps I should accept that each component in X is a cyclohexene derivative and that the total hydrogen count is 22. Looking at the options, option C is 22. Let me think: if each component has 11 hydrogen atoms, then two would have 22. But for a C6H10 molecule, there are 10 H atoms, not 11.

Wait, unless the alkenes are different. For example, if one is C5H10 and another is C7H14, but that doesn't make sense because hydrogenation would then give different products.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible structures again.

If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then X's components must be alkenes that hydrogenate to Z. So, each component must have the formula C6H10.

So, each component has 10 H atoms. Since X is a mixture of two such components, the total H atoms would be 20. But none of the options is 20. The closest is option C) 22.

So perhaps each component has 11 H atoms, but that's not possible for a C6 alkene. Alternatively, perhaps each component has more than six carbons.

Wait, maybe each component in X is a mono-alkene with the formula C7H14. Upon hydrogenation, it would add two H atoms, becoming C7H16. But that's not cyclohexane. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkenes in X are C5H10 and C7H14. But again, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible structures again.

If Z is cyclohexane (C6H12), then the alkenes in X must be C6H10. So, each has 10 H atoms. Two such alkenes would give a total of 20 H atoms.

But the options don't include 20. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that each component has 10 H atoms. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps each component in X is a di-substituted cyclohexene, which would have 10 H atoms. But that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps the alkenes in X are not mono-alkenes but dienes. For example, if X contains 1,3-cyclohexadiene, which has two double bonds. Hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, turning both double bonds into single bonds, giving cyclohexane.

In that case, each component in X would be a diene, so their formula is C6H8. Because a diene (two double bonds) would have the formula C6H8. So, upon hydrogenation, each would gain four H atoms, becoming C6H12 (cyclohexane).

So, each component in X would be C6H8 (a diene), which has 8 H atoms. So, two components would have 16 H atoms in total.

Looking at the options, option A is 16.

So, that fits. So, X is a mixture of two dienes, each with the formula C6H8.

Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in X's two liquids would be 8 +8 =16.

So, the answer would be option A)16.


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X, given the following information:

1. **Mixture X**: An equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes).
2. **Mixture Y**: Formed by treating X with platinum (Pt) and heat via a disproportionation reaction. Y is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y contains no double or triple bonds.
3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**: Both mixtures, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, yield only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is fully saturated (an alkane or cycloalkane).

### Key Analysis:
- **Hydrogen mass fraction in Z**:  
  The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which corresponds to a mass fraction of 1/7. This implies that Z is a hydrocarbon where the hydrogen contribution is 1/7 of its total molar mass. For a hydrocarbon with the formula $C_nH_{2n}$ (a cycloalkane), this condition is satisfied for $C_6H_{12}$ (cyclohexane).  
  - Molar mass of cyclohexane: $6 \times 12 + 12 = 84 \, \text{g/mol}$.  
  - Hydrogen mass: $12 \, \text{g/mol}$.  
  - Hydrogen mass fraction: $12 / 84 = 0.1428$ or 14.28%.

- **Hydrogenation of X**:  
  Since hydrogenation of X produces only Z (cyclohexane), the components of X must be alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, yield cyclohexane. Alkenes have the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$, and their hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond to form alkanes. For X to yield cyclohexane ($C_6H_{12}$), the alkenes in X must be $C_6H_{10}$ (cyclohexene or its isomers).

- **Disproportionation to form Y**:  
  When X is treated with Pt and heat, a disproportionation reaction occurs, forming Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine water. This indicates that Y contains no double or triple bonds, meaning Y consists of alkanes. Since hydrogenation of Y also produces Z (cyclohexane), the components of Y must be alkanes that, upon further reaction, yield cyclohexane.

- **Hydrogen atoms in X**:  
  Each component of X is an alkene with the formula $C_6H_{10}$, which contains 10 hydrogen atoms. Since X is a mixture of two such liquids, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two components is $10 + 10 = 20$. However, the options provided do not include 20. Reevaluating the problem, if the alkenes in X are dienes ($C_6H_8$), which contain 8 hydrogen atoms each, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two components would be $8 + 8 = 16$. This matches option **A**.

### Conclusion:
The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **16**.
