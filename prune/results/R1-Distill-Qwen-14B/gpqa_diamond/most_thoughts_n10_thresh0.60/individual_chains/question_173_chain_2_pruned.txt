Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

The question says that an electron is moving at a speed v of 2 times 10^8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nanometers. They want me to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are A to D, with different orders of magnitude.

Wait, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. The principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. The formula I think is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, sometimes I see it written without the ½ factor, depending on the source, but I think the exact constant might not matter here because we're dealing with an estimate.

So the idea is that the uncertainty in position multiplied by the uncertainty in momentum is at least on the order of ħ. And since ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s, that's the constant I should remember.

But wait, the question is about energy uncertainty. Energy is related to momentum through the kinetic energy formula. For non-relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So maybe I can find the uncertainty in momentum first and then relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

First, let's find Δp. Using the Heisenberg principle, Δx * Δp ≈ ħ. So rearranging that, Δp ≈ ħ / Δx.

Given that Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

Plugging in the numbers: ħ is about 1e-34 J·s (since 1.05e-34 is roughly 1e-34 for estimation purposes). So Δp is approximately (1e-3
