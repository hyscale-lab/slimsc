Okay, so I have this physics problem about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. Hmm, I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB, and this interaction can limit their lifetime in the universe.

The reaction given is gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs: γ + γ → e+ + e-. So, I think this process has something to do with the photon density of the CMB. The average photon energy is given as 10^-3 eV. Wait, that's a very low energy, which makes sense because the CMB is microwave radiation, so photons are low energy but very numerous.

I think the process involves the photon-photon cross-section and the density of the CMB. The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be limited when the interaction rate becomes significant. So we need to calculate the interaction rate or the mean free time, and set it to a certain condition where the lifetime is no longer very long.

I remember that the optical depth τ can be used here. Optical depth is given by τ = n σ λ, where n is the number density of target photons, σ is the cross-section for the interaction, and λ is the mean free path. But wait, another formula comes to mind: τ = n σ c t, where t is the time. When τ becomes about 1, the process is significant. So if the optical depth is about 1, the probability of interaction is around 63% (since e^-τ ≈ 1 - τ for small τ, and τ=1 gives a probability of about 1/e).

The gamma-ray's lifetime is limited when τ is order 1, meaning that the gamma-ray would interact in a time comparable to its lifetime. So, we set τ ≈ 1.

Now, the number density n of CMB photons can be found from the CMB photon density. The CMB has a blackbody spectrum at about 2.7 K. The energy density u is given by u = 8π (k_B T)^4 / (15 h^4 c^3 ), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, h is Planck's constant, and c the speed of light. Alternatively, the photon number density n can be found from u = nh c, so n = u/(h c).

Wait, let me double-check. The energy density u is the energy per unit volume, and each photon has energy ε. So, number density n = u/(ε). But for the CMB, the energy density is dominated by photons, and the average photon energy is much less than k_B T? Or maybe it's more appropriate to use the average energy as given.

Wait, the problem says the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV. So maybe I don't need to calculate it from scratch. That's easier.

So, the average photon energy ε_avg is 1e-3 eV. The number density n is u/(ε_avg), but I think u is known for CMB. Alternatively, let me think: the energy density u of CMB is about 0.23 eV/cm^3. Wait, isn't it about 1e-13 J/cm^3? Let me calculate that in eV/cm^3.

1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. So 1e-13 J/cm^3 is (1e-13 J/cm^3) / (1.6e-19 J/eV) = approx 6e5 eV/cm^3? Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, wait. The CMB energy density is about 2.7 K blackbody, which gives u = 2.7^4 * something. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the CMB photon number density. I think the number density is about 411 photons per cm^3. Because the CMB temperature is about 2.7 K, and using the formula for photon number density: n = (8 π^2 g * k_B T^3
