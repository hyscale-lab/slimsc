Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 times that, so 3.2e-19 C each.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So I'm picturing point P with one charge, and then 12 charges arranged around it, each 2 meters away. 

The question is about finding the minimum energy of the system. I remember that the potential energy in an electric system is related to the arrangement of charges. Since the system is isolated, I think we're only considering the potential energy between the charges and not any external fields or work done by other forces.

Wait, but what's the formula for electric potential energy between two point charges? I think it's U = k * (q1*q2)/r, where k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988e9 N·m²/C². But wait, that's for two charges. Since we have multiple charges, I need to consider all pairs.

Oh right, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But since all the charges are identical and symmetrically placed, maybe there's a pattern here
