Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. It looks a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step. So, the question describes a series of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. I remember that C3H6 can be either propene or cyclopropane, but more likely propene because bromination is a common reaction for alkenes.

First reaction: Compound A undergoes bromination in CCl4. So, A is probably propene. Propene (propylene) when brominated in CCl4 would undergo an addition reaction. Since it's an alkene, the bromine adds across the double bond. So, the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually indicates an elimination reaction. So, B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation. But wait, since there's two Br atoms adjacent, the KOH would likely cause an elimination to form an alkene. So, which alkene? Let's think: removing two HBr molecules. The structure of B is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, wait. No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When Br adds across double bond, it becomes CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? Wait no, that's not possible. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 across the double bond would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Or maybe it's 1,1-dibromopropane? No, because the bromine adds to each of the two carbons in the double bond. So, the structure would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. But wait, that's possible if the addition is anti, but regardless, when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate HBr from adjacent carbons.

So, two HBr eliminations would occur, leading to the formation of an alkene. So, the product C would be propene again
