Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses—1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, the masses might not be directly needed here since the problem is about elemental abundances. Hmm.

So, the given data includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. And there's also the Sun's photospheric composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) is 7.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or maybe the ratio of their Si abundances? Let me think.

Wait, no, the ratio of silicon atoms. Oh, but wait, the ratio is n_Si1 / n_Si2. Or maybe [Si/H] for each star and then take the ratio of those.

I remember that in stellar abundance studies, [X/Y] means log10(n_X/n_Y) minus log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, more precisely, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, actually, the notation is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) − log10(n_X/n_Y)_☉, where the subscript is
