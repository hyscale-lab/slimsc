Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of substitution or elimination reaction, maybe something like a phosphorylation or a substitution?

Let's start by analyzing the given data. The compound is X, and the IR and NMR have some specific peaks. I'll try to figure out what functional groups are present in X.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400â€“2500, which is a broad region and usually indicates either an -OH group (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an amine. But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O). Maybe a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is a bit low for a ketone, more like a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000, which are usually broad. Also, the 1720 could be an ester or a ketone, but if it's a carboxylic acid, there would be a very broad peak around 2500-3000. Let me check the NMR for more clues.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a high chemical shift. I think that's an -OH proton, probably from a carboxylic acid because those protons are usually around 10-12 ppm. But wait, if it's a broad singlet, maybe it's exchange with water or something. Could also be an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 and might be a triplet or something else. Hmm, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an -OH in a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2
