Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... I remember it's one of the crystal structures, right? It's a type of hexagonal or cubic structure, but wait, rhombohedral is when all the lattice parameters are equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh yeah, in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a cube that's been skewed, so all edges are the same length, but the angles between them are different.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal structure... That's the distance between neighboring atoms, so that's basically the lattice parameter 'a' in the unit cell. So a = 10 Angstroms here.

The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral crystal, all three angles are equal. So each of them is 30°, which is pretty small—so the structure is more compressed along the diagonals, perhaps.

The problem is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I recall that for crystals, we use Bragg's law and the interplanar distance d is given by the formula involving the Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice parameters.

The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ) ), but wait, no—that's not quite right. Let me think again. Oh, right, the general formula for d-spacing in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² ), but that's only for cubic systems where all angles are 90 degrees. Wait, but this is a rhombohedral system, which is a type of hexagonal system, or is it a form of cubic? Or is it a different system altogether.

Wait, rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where a = b = c, and each of the angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal. So it's a special case. So the general formula for interplanar distances in a rhombohedral system would involve the angles since the lattice isn't cubic.

I think the formula for d_hkl in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( F ), where F is a function of the Miller indices and the angles. But what's the exact formula?

Oh right, for a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos(alpha) )

Wait, no, because in cubic systems, when angles are 90 degrees, cos(alpha) would be zero, so the formula reduces to d = a/sqrt(h² +k² + l²), which makes sense. So for rhombohedral, where the angles are not 90 degrees, we have to include that cosine term.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the sign here. Let me think. I think the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α )

Because in a
