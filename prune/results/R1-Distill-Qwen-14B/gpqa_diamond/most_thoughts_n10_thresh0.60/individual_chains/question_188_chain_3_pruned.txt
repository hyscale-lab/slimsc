Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance, d, can be found using a formula involving the lattice parameters. But wait, what's the exact formula?

Rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, I think they're part of the cubic system but with all edges equal and angles not 90 degrees. Oh right, rhombohedral means all a, b, c are equal, and all angles are same but not 90. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so probably each a, b, c is 10 Angstrom.

The formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hμ + kν + lπ) ), but wait, that's for non-cubic systems. Oh wait, no, maybe for the general case, it's d = (a² (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a^2 (hk cos θ + kl cos φ + lh cos ψ )) )^(-1/2) )... No, that's getting complicated. I think I remember a more straightforward formula when the unit cell is a cube, but this is a rhombohedral, so maybe I should think in terms of vectors.

Alternatively, there's a formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. I think it's based on the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. Oh right! The general formula for d_{hkl} is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²) / a² - 2(hk cos α + kl cos β + lh cos γ) / a². Wait, but since in a rhombohedral system, a=b=c and α=β=γ, this should simplify things.

So in this case, a = 10 Angstrom, and α = β = γ = 30 degrees. The Miller indices are (111), so h=k=l=1. Let's plug these into the formula.

Wait, let me write down the formula again. For a rhombohedral crystal,
