Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. A pure state would be a density matrix that's a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but this one is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with a coefficient of 1/2.

So, first, let me write out what this ρ looks like in matrix form. The basis states |0> and |1> are the standard computational basis. The |0><0| matrix would be [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a 2x2 identity matrix scaled by 1/2.

Wait, if I recall correctly, density matrices must be positive semi-definite and have a trace equal to 1. This one does, because the trace is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, and all eigenvalues are non-negative (since it's diagonal with 1/2 on the diagonal).

But the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. Hmm. I think for a single qubit, the space can be represented in a 3-dimensional Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector r is a way to represent a qubit state. For a pure state |θ,φ>, it's a point on the unit sphere, with coordinates (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But ρ here isn't a pure state—it's a mixed state. So how is that represented?

Ah, right. For mixed states, the density matrix can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere. The density matrix ρ can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r and the identity matrix I. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, solving for r, we have r = 2(ρ - (I/2)).

Wait, let me re-derive that. The general form for a single qubit state in terms of the Bloch sphere is:

ρ = (I + xσ_x + yσ_y + zσ_z)/2

So, if I compare this to the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let's compute that. Since |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]] and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]], adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I + 0)/2, because (I)/2 is [ [½,
