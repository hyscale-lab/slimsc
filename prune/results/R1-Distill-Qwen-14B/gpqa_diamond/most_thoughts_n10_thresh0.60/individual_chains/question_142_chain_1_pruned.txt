Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about density matrices. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. Hmm.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, this ρ is a density matrix for a qubit.

I think I need to find the vector representation of this density matrix in the Bloch sphere. Oh right, because the Bloch sphere is a geometrical way to represent qubit states. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a possible state, and it's parameterized by angles θ and φ. But wait, how does the density matrix relate to that?

The Bloch vector (r) is a vector in three-dimensional space that represents the state on the Bloch sphere. For a density matrix ρ, the Bloch vector can be found using the formula r = 2*(ρ - I/2), where I is the identity matrix. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the components. Let me get that right.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,
where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (a 3-dimensional vector). So, if I can express the given ρ in this form, the coefficients will give me the components of r.

Let me write out the given ρ:
ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2.

The identity matrix for a qubit is I = |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So, ρ is (I)/2. Plugging into the general form:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2.
So, (I/2) = (I + r·σ)/2.

Hmm, if I subtract (I/2) from both sides, I get:
0 = (r·σ)/2.
Which implies that r·σ = 0. So, the vector r must be zero. That would mean the density matrix is the completely mixed state. Because when r is zero, ρ is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state, representing a classical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩ with equal probabilities.

Wait, but in the options, I'm looking for the vector r. If r is (0,0,0), that's option C. So the answer should be C.

Let me double-check. The given ρ is a maximally mixed state. So on the Bloch sphere, this corresponds to the origin (0,0,0). Because for pure states, r has a length of 1 (they're on the surface), but mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state is at the center. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking back at the options:
A) (1,1,0) — that's a point outside the sphere, so not possible.
B) (0,0,1) — that's the |+⟩ state, a pure state.
C)
