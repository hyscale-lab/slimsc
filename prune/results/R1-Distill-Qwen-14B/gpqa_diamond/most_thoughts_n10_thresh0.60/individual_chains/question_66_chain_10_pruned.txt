Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, also known as SMEFT. Hmm, I need to figure out which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each one.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, which means it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. The idea is that it's valid at energies below the new physics scale. So, what symmetries are part of the SM?

The SM respects Lorentz symmetry, right? Because it's a relativistic theory. So all its operators, including those in SMEFT, must preserve that. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh, but I think SMEFT is constructed in such a way that it's invariant under Poincare. Because the SM is, and SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimension terms respecting the same symmetries. So Poincare (option 2) is also a symmetry that operators must respect.

Now, CP symmetry. The SM doesn't always respect CP. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD has CP violation. So in SMEFT, some operators might break CP. But wait, the question is about which symmetries "must be respected by all operators". If operators are CP-even, then yes, but if there's CP violation, operators can break it. But wait, SMEFT as a theory doesn't enforce CP symmetry unless the operator's dimension is even or something? Or maybe the basis is chosen to respect certain symmetries. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the SMEFT Lagrangian is constructed to be CP-invariant. Or not? Because some higher-dimension operators can have non-invariant terms. I think in the Warsaw Basis, which is the commonly used basis for SMEFT, the operators are arranged to be either CP-even or CP-odd. But that doesn't mean that each operator is CP-symmetric. For instance, operators like O_8^q which are CP-odd would violate CP if they are present. So does the theory require all operators to respect CP? Or is CP violation allowed?

Hmm, I think the SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect CP symmetry. Instead, it's possible for operators to violate CP
