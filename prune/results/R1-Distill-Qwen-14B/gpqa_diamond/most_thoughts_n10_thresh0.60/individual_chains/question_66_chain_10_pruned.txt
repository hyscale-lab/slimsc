Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the SMEFT framework. Hmm, SMEFT is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? And the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are four symmetries: 1. Lorentz, 2. Poincare, 3. CP, 4. CPT. And the choices are combinations of these.

Wait, let me think. I remember that effective field theories (EFTs) usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory they're effective for. The Standard Model has certain symmetries, so SMEFT should preserve those.

Lorentz symmetryâ€”yeah, that's a big one. Lorentz symmetry is about the invariance under Lorentz transformations, like rotations and boosts. The Standard Model certainly respects that, so SMEFT operators must also preserve Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. So Poincare implies things like momentum conservation and energy-momentum symmetry. Wait, but isn't the SMEFT constructed in a way that it's invariant under Poincare? Because the SM is, so the EFT should inherit that. So 2 is also a symmetry that must be respected. But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Now, what about 3, CP symmetry? Hmm. Wait, the Standard Model is CP symmetric, but that's not entirely true, because
