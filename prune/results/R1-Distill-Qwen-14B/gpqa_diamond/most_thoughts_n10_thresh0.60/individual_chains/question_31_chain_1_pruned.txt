Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of the final product. Let me go through each step carefully.

The problem starts with toluene being treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration typically happens under such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene, and nitration occurs meta to the methyl group because the methyl is an activating group. Wait, no, actually, the methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So the nitration should occur at the para position relative to the methyl group. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. I think MnO2 in H2SO4 is a strong oxidizing agent. For nitrotoluenes, oxidation under acidic conditions usually leads to the formation of a nitrobenzene derivative. Wait, more specifically, when a methyl group is attached to a benzene ring with a nitro group (like para-nitrotoluene), oxidation would convert the methyl group into a ketone. Oh right! Because the methyl is adjacent to the nitro group. When you oxidize a methyl group attached to a benzene ring (like in toluene derivatives), it typically forms a benzoic acid, but wait, no. Wait, toluene (methylbenzene) oxidizes to benzoic acid. But in this case, the nitro group is present. So para-nitrotoluene on oxidation would form para-nitrobenzaldehyde? No, wait. Let me think: oxidation of a methyl group attached to benzene with a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 in acidic conditions would convert the methyl into a COOH group. But wait, MnO2 and H2SO4 are used for oxidation too. So the methyl (CH3) becomes COOH. So product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid, right? Wait, no, wait, wait. Toluene is benzene with a methyl group. Product 1 is nitrotoluene, para position. Then, when you oxidize the methyl group, it becomes a carboxylic acid group. So product 2 is 4-nitrobenzoic acid.

Wait, but wait another thing. Toluene is C6H5CH3. When you nitrate it, you get C6H5CH2NO2
