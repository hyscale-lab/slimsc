Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of the star has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations as they come into and go out of view. The way the brightness changes over time looks a bit like what an exoplanet would do when it transits in front of the star. The question is asking, if we didn't have these spots, what size exoplanet would produce the same brightness change, i.e., the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm. So I think I need to compare the brightness dip caused by the spots to what a planet would cause. Let me recall what I know.

First, when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness (the depth of the transit) is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet relative to the star. So if the star's radius is R, and the planet's radius is r, the area is πr² / πR² = (r/R)^2. So the fractional change in brightness ΔF is (r/R)^2.

But in this case, the star isn't just being blocked by a planet—its spots are causing a variation. So I need to calculate the equivalent dip caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Wait, but how do the spots affect the brightness? Because they are cooler, when they rotate into view, the observed brightness from that part of the star decreases. So the total brightness is the sum of the unspotted and spotted regions.

Let me think. The star's total flux without any spots would be based on its entire surface emitting at 6000 K. But with spots, part of the surface is emitting less.

The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area times the flux per unit area (which depends on temperature). The flux per unit area is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σT^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the total flux without spots would be F_total = σ * (6000)^4 * (4π R^2), since the surface area is 4π R².

But with spots, the flux is a combination of the non-spotted and spotted regions. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. So 20% of the surface is at 5000 K (since it's 1000 K cooler than 6000 K). Wait, the temperature difference is 1000 K, so spots are 5000 K?

Assuming that the spots are cooler, so their flux per unit area is lower. So the total flux when spots are visible (i.e., when the star is rotating and the spots are in our view) would be the sum of the flux from the spotted and non-spotted hemispheres.

Wait, but the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Wait no, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So 20% of that hemisphere is covered in spots. So the entire star is a sphere, but one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area.

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So one hemisphere (so half the star's surface) has 20% of that hemisphere covered by spots. So the total spotted area is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1, or 10% of the entire star's surface area. Oh wait,
