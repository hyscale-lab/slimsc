Okay, so I've got this physics problem about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, so I'll have to think carefully.

Alright, the problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, that's the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. So we'll have to calculate the Lorentz gamma factor for the particle's motion.

The energy given isn't the rest mass energy, I think, because the rest mass is 3.41 GeV. So the kinetic energy plus rest mass energy would be the total energy. Oh, wait, no, wait. Energy here is the total energy, including rest mass. Because usually, energy E is given as gamma * m c². So E = 27 GeV, and m = 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²). But wait, E is in GeV, and m is also in GeV/c², so the units should work out because c is accounted for.

So Gamma (γ) equals E divided by m c². But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², and c is in units where maybe it's considered, perhaps the calculation simplifies. Let me think about units. E = gamma m c², so gamma is E/(m c²). If E is 27 GeV and m c² is 3.41 GeV, then gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 8 is about 27.28, so 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's say roughly 7.9.

Wait, but I should compute it more accurately. 3.41 * 7 is 23.87. 3.41 * 7.9 is 3.41 *7 +3.41 *0.9 =23.87 +3.069=26.939, very close to 27. So gamma is approximately 7.9.

So gamma is approximately 7.9. Then the observed lifetime is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So tau is gamma * tau0. So tau = 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let's compute that.

7.9 *8 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 seconds, which is 6.32e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does that relate to the resolution? Hmm, I think the resolution is the
