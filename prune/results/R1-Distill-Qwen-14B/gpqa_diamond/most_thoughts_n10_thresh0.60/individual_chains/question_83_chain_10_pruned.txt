Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about titration and pH calculations. But let's take it step by step. I'll try to think through each part carefully.

The question says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm. I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Oh right, using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So initially, the acetic acid solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. When we add another 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

So the new concentration (M2) would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Got that.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The neutralization reaction would produce sodium acetate (CH3COO⁻Na⁺) and water. So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let me think about the equivalence point first because maybe that's easier. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized. But since NaOH is a strong base, the solution will be the sodium salt of a weak acid, so the solution will be basic. The pH will be greater than 7.

So to find the equivalence point pH, I need to calculate the concentration of the sodium acetate solution.

First, let's find out the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity * Volume (L). The initial volume is 20 cm³ which is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Since the titration is with NaOH, which is a strong base, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. So at equivalence, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001 moles.

The volume of NaOH required to reach equivalence can be found by moles / Molarity. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. Wait, but the question doesn't ask for that volume directly, so maybe I don't need it right now.

At equivalence, the solution is the sodium acetate in water. The total volume will be the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³), which is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). The moles of sodium acetate will be 0.001 moles.

So the concentration of sodium acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water. The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻. The Kb can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, because Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The formula for Kb is [CH3COOH][OH-] / [CH3COO⁻]. Let's let x be the [OH-] produced. So at equilibrium, [CH3COO⁻] is approximately 0.02 - x. Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate [CH3COO⁻] ≈ 0.02.

So, Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10. Solving for x, x^2 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. That's [OH-], so pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. Then pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but wait. None of the options have a pH of around 9. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, another thought: when making sodium acetate, the concentration is 0.02 M. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5.

Kw = 1e-14.

So Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1/1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. That part was correct.

So then [OH-] is sqrt( (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ) which is sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 1.04e-5. So pOH is about 4.98, so pH about 9.02. But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I approached the equivalence point.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution after equivalence is not just the hydrolysis of acetate. Wait, no,
