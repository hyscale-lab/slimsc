Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to titration calculations, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? So when we add water, it's going to dilute the concentration, which will affect its dissociation. Let me think about the initial concentration after dilution.

Wait, so the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid after dilution would be half of the original, since the volume doubles. So original concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³, the new concentration is 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with the acetic acid in a neutralization reaction. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So the mole ratio is 1:1.

Now, we need to find the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Starting with the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid will be neutralized to form its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO⁻). The solution will be a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution should be basic.

But wait, how much sodium acetate is present? Let me calculate the moles first.

The diluted acetic acid volume is 40 cm³ (20+20). Moles of CH3COOH initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Because M = moles/volume (L), so moles = M * volume (L). 20 cm³ is 0.02 L, but wait wait, wait. Oh, wait no. Wait, the diluted solution is 20 + 20 = 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

At equivalence, all of that is neutralized to acetate. So moles of CH3COO⁻ is 0.001 moles. The sodium acetate will dissolve in the total solution volume. What's the total volume at equivalence? Well, when we titrate, we add NaOH solution until equivalence. Let's see, the volume of NaOH at equivalence would be (moles of NaOH)/(0.1 M). Moles NaOH needed is same as moles of CH3COOH, which is 0.001 mol.

So volume of NaOH added is 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the total solution volume is 40 cm³ +10 cm³=50 cm³=0.05 L.

So the concentration of acetate ion is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, to find the pH at equivalence point. Since it's a solution of acetate ion, it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO⁻ + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH⁻

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Setting up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH⁻] / [CH3COO⁻]

Assuming x is the [OH⁻], then:

5.405e-10 = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x)

Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → x² ≈ 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH-] ≈ 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 (since log(1e-5)=5, log(1.04)=0.017, so 5 - 0.017=4.983). So pH = 14 - 4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, that's around 9.0. But looking at the options, I don't see any with equivalence pH around 9. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approximately 5.405e-10. Right.

Concentration of acetate is 0.02 M.

So Kb = x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. So x = sqrt(1.081
