Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalized. Because we're dealing with probabilities, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, that's a complex function? Because of the 'i' term. So the wave function is complex, which is normal because wave functions can be complex.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So, for each point x, the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

So, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute the absolute square. The absolute square of a complex number a + ib is (a² + b²). So in this case, the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is (-0.5). So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, wait. The wave function's real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So when we square the absolute value, it's [ (a²)/(1+x) ) ] + ( (-0.5)^2 ). So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, that's the probability density. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx should equal 1 because the total probability is 1.

So, the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx equals 1.

Let me write that out:

∫₁³ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1

I can split this integral into two parts:

a² ∫₁³ [1/(1+x)] dx + 0.25 ∫₁³ dx = 1

Calculating each integral separately.

First integral: ∫ [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3 is ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

Second integral: ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 3 -1 = 2.

So putting it together:

a² * ln(2) + 0.25 * 2 = 1

Simplify:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2)

Compute the numerical value. Let's see, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7209

Taking the square root gives a ≈ sqrt(0.7209) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close.

Wait, but wait—am I sure that the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i? So, the real
