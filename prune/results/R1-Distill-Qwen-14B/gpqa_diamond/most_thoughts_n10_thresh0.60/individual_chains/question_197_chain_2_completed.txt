Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it through carefully. Hmm, the question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product. The options are A to D. 

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X. The IR and NMR data should give me clues about the structure.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester or acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which might be from aromatic C=C stretching. The 1450 cm-1 peak could be from either aromatic C-H bending or possibly another carbonyl group in a different environment, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: The peaks are at 10.5 ppm, which is pretty downfield. That's a strong signal, and it's broad but singlet. Wait, 10.5 is usually indicative of an aldehyde proton or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the aldehyde would be a triplet if it's adjacent to something else, but here it's a broad singlet. Hmm, maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Or perhaps it's an aldehyde with some hydrogen bonding? Or maybe an acidic proton elsewhere.

The next peak is at 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating to 2H. That sounds like para-substituted aromatic protons. Because if you have two protons as a doublet, it's probably in a para arrangement—like a para-disubstituted benzene. So, maybe two substituents on the benzene ring at opposite positions.

Then, 7.2 ppm is another doublet for 2H. So, that's probably the other set of aromatic protons. So, if the 8.0 is a doublet, and 7.2 is another, maybe the substituents are in such a way that they cause splitting into doublets each. Like, two substituents in para positions, each with two Hs as doublets. So, perhaps each substituent is a CH2 group or something.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH group next to something else, maybe adjacent to an electronegative group or part of a branched structure.

1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. Perhaps part of a CH2 group attached to an oxygen or another group.

1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That looks like a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. A doublet might come from coupling with one neighboring proton. So, maybe a CH(CH3) group? Or perhaps a CH2CH(CH3) structure.

0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H. Triplets are usually from CH2 groups next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group, where the CH2CH3 gives a triplet for the CH3. So, maybe a CH2CH2CH3 somewhere.

Let me try to sketch this. The aromatic part seems to be a para-substituted benzene. Each substituent is a group that has two protons. Wait, but the substituents could be groups that have their own protons. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene where each substituent is a single group that's not necessarily para. Wait, no, because the NMR shows two doublets for 2H each, which fits a para-substituted benzene with two substituents each having two protons. So, for example, if each substituent is an ethyl group, but that doesn't fit the data.

Wait, no, maybe each substituent is a CH2 group adjacent to another group. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is an isopropyl group or something else. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are each a CH2CH2 group, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the substituents are each a CH2 group adjacent to another function.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group. Because the IR has 1720 cm-1, which I thought was a carbonyl. So, maybe the benzene has two carbonyl groups attached? No, that would complicate the NMR. Let me think again.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. Also, the 10.5 ppm peak in NMR could be an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm), but aldehyde protons are typically sharp singlets. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, but those are usually even broader and could be around 10-12 ppm. But wait, if the IR doesn't have a broad peak around 2500-3000, which is usually the O-H stretch for carboxylic acids. Oh, the IR does have a broad peak from 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a very broad region—maybe an O-H or N-H stretch. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol or a primary amine.

Wait, but the 1720 peak is more likely a ketone or an ester, or maybe an acid. If the compound has a carbonyl group and an O-H, then perhaps it's a ketone with an alcohol group, but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (1H), which is broad. That could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. So perhaps that's an aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring. Then, the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks would be the aromatic protons.

Wait, but if there's a carbonyl (like a ketone), but the aldehyde is present, maybe it's a benzaldehyde derivative. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. The IR at 1720 could be a carboxylic acid carbonyl (though those are usually a bit lower, around 1700 cm-1), but maybe it's a conjugated acid. But the 10.5 ppm peak would fit a carboxylic acid proton. However, the IR broad region (3400-2500) could be the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the O-H stretch in a carboxylic acid is usually very broad, around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is what the IR shows. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. So, maybe the benzene has a substituent which is a carboxylic acid group.

But then, the NMR has a singlet at 10.5 ppm, which would fit that. So, the structure could be something like para-substituted benzene with a carboxylic acid group and another substituent.

Wait, but the NMR has an aldehyde proton at 10.5, but let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone. Wait, the aldehyde would have a proton around 9-10, and that's a singlet. The 1H NMR says 'bs' which is broad and singlet. So, if it's an aldehyde, it's a sharp singlet, but here it's broad. That makes me think maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because the O-H in a carboxylic acid is broad and can appear around 10-12 ppm.

Wait, but in the 1H NMR, the 10.5 ppm is 1H. Carboxylic acids have a -OH proton, which is usually broad. So that fits. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid substituent and another substituent. The other substituent would account for the other NMR signals.

Looking at the other signals: 2.9 ppm is a multiplet for 1H. That could be a CH next to an oxygen. For example, if there's a CH2CH2 group attached, or perhaps a CH attached to a carbonyl.

Wait, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. Maybe that's part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or something else. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group. Like a CH(CH3) group. Because if it's a CH2CH3, the triplet would be at around 1 ppm. But wait, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm, which is a triplet for 3H. So, that would be a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, perhaps the structure has a -CH2CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together: The benzene has a carboxylic acid group and another substituent. The substituent is a branch that includes a CH(CH3) group and a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to build the structure step by step.

If the benzene ring is para-substituted, each substituent is in the para position. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (COOH), and the other is a substituent with a longer chain.

Looking at the NMR, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group—so an ethyl group attached to something else. Let me think about the rest of the chain.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is likely a CH3 attached to a CH, which is then attached to another group. So, maybe it's a CH(CH3) group. So, the substituent on the benzene could be something like -CH2-C(CH3)(something).

Wait, let's consider the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H). That could be a CH group adjacent to an oxygen or another group. Let me think of a chain like:

Ph-CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)

Wait, but that would give certain NMR signals. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-COOH group. But wait, the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which could be a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, the substituent is an alkyl chain with a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group with a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is in the range for aromatic C=C. The 1450 cm-1 is perhaps from aromatic C-H in the ortho positions. So, the benzene is para-substituted.

So, putting the substituents as COOH and another group. The other group's NMR signals:

- The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) could be a CH group attached to something else.

- The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) could be part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2.

- The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group.

- The 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a CH2CH3 group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3) group. Wait, that would be a neopentyl group or something similar.

Wait, let me think: The substituent is a -CH2- group attached to a CH that has a methyl and an ethyl group. So, the substituent would be a CH2 connected to a CH(CH2CH3)(CH3) group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)(CH3). Wait, but that would give a branching.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a butyl group in some configuration. Let's think about the substituent as a butyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, the substituent is on the benzene as a propyl group or butyl group. Let me think about the NMR:

The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be the central CH in a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that's usually around 1.2-1.6 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's adjacent to another group.

Wait, another approach: Let's sum the integration. The aromatic protons are 4H (two doublets each of 2H). The other signals are 1H (10.5), 1H (2.9), 2H (1.7), 3H (1.4), and 3H (0.9). That's a total of 1+2+3+3+1=10 H. Wait, no, 10.5 is 1H, 8.0 is 2H, 7.2 is 2H, 2.9 is 1H, 1.7 is 2H, 1.4 is 3H, and 0.9 is 3H. So total H: 1+2+2+1+2+3+3 = 12 H. So, the molecule has 12 hydrogens.

Wait, the aromatic ring has 4 H (since two substituents), so the substituents must account for 8 H. Let me think of the substituents as COOH (which doesn't add H beyond the ring) and another group that has 8 H.

Wait, no, the substituent with the chain would have the Hs. Let me think again.

If the benzene has two substituents, one is COOH (0 H in substituent), and the other substituent is a group that contributes 8 H. Hmm, but that seems a lot. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, no: the substituent could be a chain that includes a CH2 group, a CH group, and some methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to a benzene ring. Let me think: the substituent is a propyl group, but the NMR doesn't fit.

Wait, looking at the substituent's NMR:

The 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 doublet (3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH. So, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but I don't think that's right.

Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. But I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, but then that would lead to a longer chain.

Alternatively, let me think about the substituent as a -CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH3) group. But that would require a carbon attached to three groups: two methyl and one CH2CH3, which might not be possible unless it's a quaternary carbon. Hmm, maybe that's a sec-butyl group.

Wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3) attached to the benzene. Wait, actually, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. The structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. This would be a branch where the chain is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which would be the methyl group attached to the CH. So, in the substituent, the CH is attached to a methyl (CH3) and a CH2 group.

If the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, perhaps it's a isobutyl group.

Wait, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH3. Wait, no, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2. No, wait, isobutyl is (CH2)CH(CH3)2? Or is it CH2CH(CH2CH3)?

Wait, the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. No, wait, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-, but that's not correct. Let me think again.

The isobutyl group is actually -(CH2)2CH(CH3)-. No, wait, no. Let me clarify: the isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, the substituent is a tertiary butyl group perhaps.

Wait, no, the substituent is attached to the benzene as a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group, which is an isobutyl group. The structure would be benzene-CH2CH(CH3)2. But that would mean the substituent is a tertiary butyl group, which is (CH2)C(CH3)2.

Wait, but the NMR signals don't quite fit that. Let's see:

In a tertiary butyl group, the CH2 would be adjacent to the benzene, and the CH would be the central carbon attached to two methyl groups. So, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 (if adjacent to the CH), and a singlet for the CH3 groups. But in the given data, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which suggests a single methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps it's a secondary carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. But that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH3 group attached to the benzene, but that would be an ethyl group, but the NMR doesn't quite fit that.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of compound X with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are usually used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but wait, no, more commonly, they are used for the elimination of HX from certain groups. Alternatively, they can be used in the hydrolysis of esters or perhaps in the dehydrohalogenation. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that's usually with amines and chlorine.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI is a reagent for the elimination of HX from a compound. For example, if the compound has a vicinal dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons), treatment with red phosphorus and HI would lead to the formation of an alkene via dehydrohalogenation.

Alternatively, in the case of a halide adjacent to a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a Clemmensen reduction, but that's with Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, another thought: when alcohols react with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it's a way to substitute the hydroxyl group for an iodide. This is called the Finkelstein reaction, but that's typically in a polar aprotic solvent and involves KI and NaI. Alternatively, perhaps the compound X has an alcohol group that's being converted to iodide here.

So, if compound X has an -OH group, then treating it with red phosphorus and HI would replace the OH with I, forming an iodide.

But wait, looking at the options, some are acids, some are benzene derivatives with substituents. Let me look at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH. But the substituent would be ethyl on the benzene, but I'm not sure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent at the para position.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. So, another toluene derivative.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, if compound X has an alcohol group, it would be converted to iodide. But if it's a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, if X is a benzoic acid derivative, then treating it with HI and red phosphorus might not do much unless it's undergoing some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl ester with an alcohol group.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with an alcohol group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the IR data has 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. If X is a carboxylic acid, the IR would have a broad O-H around 2500-3300 cm-1 and a strong carbonyl around 1700 cm-1. Here, the IR has a 1720, which is a bit higher, suggesting maybe an ester or ketone instead.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to focus on the reaction. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. What kind of reactions do these reagents cause?

Red phosphorus and HI are used for the substitution of hydroxyl groups with iodide. For example, if compound X has an alcohol (-OH), the reaction would replace -OH with -I. So, the product would be the corresponding iodide.

So, if X has an -OH group, say in a benzylic position, the reaction would produce a benzyl iodide.

But looking at the options, none of them are iodides. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X has a carbonyl group and an adjacent leaving group. For example, if X is a ketone with a halide next to it, the red phosphorus and HI might cause elimination, forming an alkene.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile. Wait, but the IR doesn't show a nitrile peak, which is usually around 2200 cm-1.

Wait, perhaps X is a secondary or tertiary alcohol, and the reaction converts it to an iodide.

Wait, another thought: if X has an ester group, the reaction might not do much unless it's a specific type of ester.

Alternatively, maybe X is a benzaldehyde with an alcohol substituent. So, for example, a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad singlet). If that's an aldehyde proton, then the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could reduce the aldehyde to a primary alcohol. But how?

Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm not sure about aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent that's an alcohol. Then, the reaction would convert the alcohol to iodide. Then, the aldehyde would remain.

But looking at the options, none of them have an aldehyde group except option A, which is a propanoic acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with an ester substituent. Then, the reaction would convert any alcohol group to iodide.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with an adjacent substituent that has an -OH group. Then, the reaction would substitute that -OH with -I, forming a benzaldehyde iodide.

But the options don't show an iodide. Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path.

Let me try to think about the possible structure of X based on the NMR.

So, the 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (1H, broad singlet) → likely a carboxylic acid -OH proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → para-substituted benzene.

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m) → perhaps a CH adjacent to an electronegative group.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, m) → perhaps a CH2.

- 1.4 ppm (3H, d) → CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (3H, t) → CH2CH3.

So, the substituent on the benzene is a group that includes a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that would be a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group. No, that would be a secondary butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, putting it all together, the substituent could be a propyl group where the middle CH has a methyl branch.

So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, but then the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to the benzene (let's say at position 1) would be split into a triplet if adjacent to a CH.

The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH in the middle, which is attached to two CH2 groups and a methyl.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a pentyl group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group, which is a butyl group. So, the substituent would be a tert-butyl group? No, wait, t-butyl is (CH3)3C-.

Wait, perhaps it's a secondary butyl group, like -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the reaction again.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which typically converts alcohols to iodides. So, if X has an -OH group, the reaction would form an -I.

But looking at the options, they are all either acids or substituted benzene rings. So, perhaps X is a benzoic acid derivative with an -OH group adjacent to a carbonyl or another group.

Wait, but benzoic acid derivatives typically don't have much for an -OH group except the carboxylic acid. Unless there's another alcohol substituent.

Hmm, maybe X is a benzaldehyde with a secondary alcohol substituent. Then, the reaction would replace the secondary alcohol with iodide.

Wait, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative with a carbonyl group. For example, a phenyl acetone structure.

Wait, if X is 4-phenyl-2-butanone, then the IR would show a strong carbonyl. The NMR would have the aromatic protons, and then the ketone's CH groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl propionate ester. But then the IR would show an ester carbonyl, which would be around 1740 cm-1. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit lower, suggesting maybe a ketone or an acid.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1 are indicative of aromatic C=C and possibly C-O stretching. The 1610 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C, and 1450 could be C-O from an ester or ether.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think about the reaction again. If X has an -OH group, and it's converted to -I, then the product would have an iodide. But none of the options have iodide, so perhaps the product is not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the iodide is a leaving group leading to elimination.

Wait, perhaps X has a structure where the -OH is adjacent to a carbonyl, making it a good leaving group upon treatment with HI and red phosphorus. For example, if X is a β-keto alcohol, the reaction could lead to elimination, forming an enone.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative, and the iodide is formed, which could then undergo elimination to form an alkene.

But I'm getting stuck without a clear picture of X's structure.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one fits the reaction.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid → structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene → structure is toluene with isobutyl and methyl substituents.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid → structure is benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at para.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene → toluene with sec-butyl and methyl.

So, the reaction forms one of these.

Assuming that X reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form the product. Let's think about what each option would require as X.

If the product is a benzoic acid (option C), then X must have been a compound that upon reaction becomes benzoic acid. But that would require X to have a substituent that can be oxidized, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are oxidizing agents.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl iodide, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to benzoic acid. But that would require a different setup.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde, and the reaction adds HI to form a diiodide. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction replaces the ester oxygen with iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl group and an -OH group. Then, treating with red phosphorus and HI converts the -OH to -I, leading to a compound with a carbonyl and iodide.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol with a carbonyl group. Then, the reaction converts the alcohol to iodide, forming a benzyl iodide.

But again, none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl. Then, treatment with HI and red phosphorus could lead to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene.

But looking at the options, none are alkenes.

Wait, another angle: the IR data includes 1720 cm-1, which suggests a carbonyl. The NMR has a broad peak at 10.5, which could be an aldehyde. If X is a benzaldehyde derivative, then reaction with HI and red phosphorus might not change the aldehyde but could modify another group.

Wait, perhaps X has a benzaldehyde group and a substituent with an alcohol. Then, the reaction would convert the alcohol to iodide, but the aldehyde would remain.

But again, the options don't show aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl group on the ring. The reaction would convert the hydroxyl to iodide, but I don't see an option matching that.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to figure out what the substituent on the benzene is in X.

The substituent must account for the NMR signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. The 2.9 ppm is 1H, which is a CH. The 1.7 ppm is 2H (CH2), 1.4 is 3H (CH3), and 0.9 is 3H (CH2CH3).

Putting that together, the substituent is likely a chain like CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. So, the substituent is a pentyl group, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group.

Wait, another thought: the substituent might be a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Then, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 next to benzene would be around δ 2.9 (but that's the CH, not the CH2).

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But that would require more protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle carbon has a methyl branch. So, structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to benzene: perhaps around δ 2.5-3.

- The CH(CH3) would be around δ 1.7-2.9.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider that the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

So, the substituent would be attached to the benzene as:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Wait, but that would be a pentyl group. No, wait, the substituent would be a butyl group, with the structure -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-, which is a sec-butyl group.

The NMR for a sec-butyl group would have:

- The CH2 next to benzene (δ around 1.4?), but that's not matching.

Wait, another approach: in the substituent, the CH that is attached to the benzene would be a CH2, and the next carbon would be CH(CH3), followed by a CH2CH3.

Wait, in that case, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, the substituent is a pentyl group but with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a neopentyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group, which is a sec-butyl group. In that case, the NMR would show:

The CH2 next to benzene would be a triplet (coupled with the adjacent CH), the CH would be a multiplet, and the CH2CH3 would be a triplet.

But the NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (1H, m): perhaps the CH in the middle.

- 1.7 ppm (2H, m): perhaps the CH2 next to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (3H, d): the methyl attached to CH.

- 0.9 ppm (3H, t): the ethyl group.

So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 group. Which is a butyl group with a branch. Wait, but the substituent would be a pentyl group? No, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2- group. I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching at the second carbon. So, the structure would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 next to benzene: maybe around 1.7 ppm (but in the data, it's 2.9 ppm).

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting it. Let me move to the reaction again.

If X has an -OH group that is converted to -I, then the product would have an iodide. But the options don't include iodide. So perhaps the reaction is elimination, forming an alkene.

Wait, if X has a structure like Ph-CH2-CH(OH)-R, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI could lead to elimination, forming Ph-CH2-CH=CH-R or similar.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol, and the reaction converts it to benzyl iodide. Then, perhaps further reaction could occur, but it's not clear.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me think: if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid with an -OH group, then the reaction would convert the -OH to -I, but that doesn't fit any option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction with red phosphorus and HI could be a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid. For example, if X is a phenyl acetate, then hydrolysis would give benzoic acid.

But the NMR doesn't fit that scenario.

Wait, the NMR of X has a peak at 10.5 ppm (1H, broad). That's probably a carboxylic acid -OH. So, X could be a benzoic acid derivative with another substituent.

So, X's structure is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a chain leading to the NMR signals at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm.

If X is 4-(something)benzoic acid, then the substituent would be a chain attached to the para position of the benzene.

The substituent's NMR signals suggest a CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So, the substituent would be a butyl group with a branch. So, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group.

So, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Then, upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? If X is a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group, and the reaction converts any -OH groups to -I, but X only has the carboxylic acid -OH, which is not reactive under these conditions.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but again, that's not applicable here.

Wait, maybe X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzyl alcohol derivative with a carbonyl group. The reaction converts the benzyl alcohol to benzyl iodide.

But if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then the reaction would not change it, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzene ring with a ketone group and a substituent. Then, the reaction could cause elimination.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is that, then the reaction would have to not change it. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzoic acid with a substituent that has a hydroxyl group, and the reaction converts that -OH to -I. But the product would then have an iodide, which is not any of the options.

Wait, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a substituent that has an -OH group. Then, the reaction would convert the -OH to -I, but the aldehyde would remain. But again, the options don't have aldehydes.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester of benzoic acid, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to the acid. But then, the product would be the acid, which is option C.

So, if X is the ester, such as benzyl propionate, then treatment with red phosphorus and HI would hydrolyze the ester to benzoic acid. But that would require X to be an ester, and the NMR would have to match that.

But the NMR of X shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid rather than an ester. Esters typically don't have protons in the 10 ppm region, unless it's an aldehyde.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Looking at the NMR data, the substituent's structure seems to fit a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring at the para position, along with a carboxylic acid group.

So, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not change it, but that's option C. So, perhaps the product is option C.

Wait, but the reaction is supposed to change X into something else. Unless the reaction doesn't affect the benzoic acid group but does something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde with a sec-butyl group, and the reaction converts the aldehyde to something else.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. So, if X is a benzoate ester with a sec-butyl group, the reaction could hydrolyze it to benzoic acid. Then, the product would be option C.

So, X would be the ester, and the reaction would hydrolyze it to the acid.

In that case, the product is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Given that reasoning, the answer would be option C.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus and HI, based on the provided IR and NMR data. The analysis proceeds as follows:

### IR and NMR Data Analysis:
1. **IR Data**:
   - **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H or N-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
   - **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid or ester.
   - **1610 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching.
   - **1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C-H bending or possibly another carbonyl group.

2. **NMR Data**:
   - **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Broad singlet, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-OH).
   - **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted benzene ring.
   - **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Multiplet for 1H, likely a CH group adjacent to an electronegative group.
   - **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Multiplet for 2H, likely a CH₂ group.
   - **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Doublet for 3H, likely a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH.
   - **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for 3H, likely a CH₂CH₃ group.

### Structural Interpretation:
- The **10.5 ppm peak** and the broad singlet suggest the presence of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
- The **para-substituted benzene** (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm) indicates a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.
- The **substituent signals** (2.9 ppm, 1.7 ppm, 1.4 ppm, and 0.9 ppm) suggest a branched alkyl chain. The **1.4 ppm doublet (3H)** and **0.9 ppm triplet (3H)** indicate a methyl group (CH₃) and an ethyl group (CH₂CH₃), respectively. The **2.9 ppm multiplet (1H)** and **1.7 ppm multiplet (2H)** suggest a CH group adjacent to a CH₂ group.

Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, where the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at one para position and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)) at the other.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI typically convert alcohols to iodides. However, in this case, Compound X does not contain an alcohol group but is already a carboxylic acid. Therefore, the reaction does not alter the structure of Compound X.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, corresponding to **Option C**.
