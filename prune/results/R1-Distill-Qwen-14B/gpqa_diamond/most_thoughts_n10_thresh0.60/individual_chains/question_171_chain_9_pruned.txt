Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I need to figure out the order of substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer they produce. Hmm, I remember that in such reactions, the position where the substituent adds depends on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and if it's meta or para directing.

The question lists six substances, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups. The substituents are:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxy carbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

When they undergo electrophilic substitution with excess bromine, each substituent will direct the incoming Br+ either ortho, meta, or para. Also, activating groups increase the rate, deactivating decrease it.

So for each substituent, I need to determine the directing effect and the activating/deactivating nature.

1) Methyl (CH3): This is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It's ortho/para directing. So when bromine adds, it'll go mainly to ortho and para positions. But wait, the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. Oh, wait, no—wait, wait. No, wait, in each substitution, only one monobromo product is formed. Hmm, no, maybe the question means that each substance undergoes bromination to form a single product. Or perhaps, it's about the position where substitution occurs. Or maybe the question is about the para-isomer's yield. Because when a substituent is present, the incoming electrophile can add in different positions.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer in the product. So for each compound, when bromine is added, what's the percentage of para substitution.

So, for each substituent, what is their directing effect and whether they are activating or deactivating.

Let me list each substituent:

1) CH3: activating, o/p directing. So when bromine adds, it can go to ortho or para. Since it's activating, the reaction is faster. But in the case of a single substituent, the major product is para. Wait, no. For example, the monobromination of toluene (methylbenzene) gives a mixture of ortho, meta, and para. But wait, methyl is activating, so the major product is para, or is it ortho? Wait, I think for groups that are o/p directing, the para is more favored than ortho because of steric hindrance. Or maybe in some cases, like when the substituent is bulky, the para is more favored. But methyl is not that bulky, so maybe ortho is more favored? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think actually, if the group is activating and o/p directing, the major product is the ortho and para, but the ratio might depend on the substituent's size. For methyl, which is small, I think the para is major. Or wait, maybe for toluene, the ortho is about 50%, para around 30%, and meta 20% or something like that. But the question is about the weight fraction of para-isomer. So for each substituent, I need to figure out how much para product is formed relative to others.

Wait, but the question statement says that each substance undergoes an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine, and only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, that can't be right—how can only one product form if it's an o/p directing group? Unless each substituent is such that only one position is possible, which seems unlikely. Oh, perhaps the substituent is such that it only allows substitution in one position. For example, a nitro group is meta directing, so only the meta position is possible. But wait, no, nitro is meta directing, so substitution occurs in meta. So when the substituent is nitro (NO2), the incoming Br will go meta to it, so only para isomer if the substituent is in
