Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Let's start by understanding the problem.

Okay, the question says that a specific barley cultivar has this anti-nutritional compound, and the gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at changes in the target gene. The sequencing shows changes in the first exon area.

The goal is to find a mutation that probably stops the production of the compound. So, I think we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene function, maybe by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the intact gene.

The intact gene sequence in the first part is: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA. So, comparing, the third nucleotide changes from T to C (becomes TTC -> TCC), but wait, let me check the exact positions. Oh, the first exon area is where the changes are. Wait, the first part is the initial exons.

Looking at the changes:

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the sixth nucleotide in the gene is T in the intact. In Mutant 1, it's C. Let's see the exact positions.

Wait, the intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the first part is ATG followed by TTT in the intact, but in Mutant 1, it's TTC. So the second codon is TTT (Phe) in intact, and TCT (Ser) in Mutant 1? Wait, no, the codon
