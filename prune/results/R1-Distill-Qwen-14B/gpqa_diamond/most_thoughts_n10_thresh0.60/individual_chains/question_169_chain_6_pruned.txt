Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about comparing two decay processes and how the energy spectrum of one of the emitted particles changes.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. And the variant changes it to emitting one exotic, massless particle M instead of the 2V. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M, I suppose. Wait, no, wait. The original decay has 2V, so the variant replaces those two V particles with one M. But wait, the problem says the variant emits one M instead of two V. So the reaction would be 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Hmm, that's what I thought.

The question is about the total energy spectrum of the outgoing E particles. In the original case, the E particles have a continuous spectrum with some maximum Q. Now, how does changing the decay affect this?

I remember that in beta decay, for example, the emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the decay involves the transformation of a neutron into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. The energy is shared among these particles, leading to a range of possible energies for the electron. The maximum energy corresponds to when the antineutrino has negligible energy.

But wait, in this case, the original decay emits two E and two V particles. So the energy is partitioned among all four particles. But
