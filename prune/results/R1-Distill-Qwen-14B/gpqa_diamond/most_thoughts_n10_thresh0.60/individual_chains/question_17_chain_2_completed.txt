Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with EDTA. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability of these complexes is often described by a formation constant, K. The given K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. Oh wait, the K here must be the formation constant, which is pretty large, so the complex is very stable.

So, the problem is to find the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. I think I remember that when a complex forms, the concentration of the free ions depends on this formation constant. The formula I vaguely recall is something like K equals the concentration of the complex divided by the product of the concentrations of the individual ions. Since the complex is Ca-EDTA, each Ca²+ combines with one EDTA^4- ion.

Let me write down the reaction. The reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. So the formation constant K is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Given that K is large, the complex is favored, so the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA should be very low.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That means, without considering dissociation, all the Ca and EDTA are tied up in the complex. But because K is so big, some of the complex must dissociate a little bit. So, the dissociation will release a tiny amount of Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. So, the concentration of the complex at equilibrium will be approximately 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x will be really small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That's a useful approximation.

So, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will both be x. Because for each complex that dissociates, one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- are released. So, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x.

Plugging these into the K expression: K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02/(x²). And K is given as 5e10.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, K is 5e10. So, 5e10 = (0.02)/(x²). Let me write that as:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2)

So, solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / (5e10) 

Hmm, 0.02 is 2e-2. So,

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/(5)) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

Taking the square root of both sides: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, no, 4e-13 is 4 times 1e-13, so square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5 *2=13. So sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5. But 1e-6.5 is the same as 3.16e-7 approximately.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 4e-13 is 4 x 10^-13. Square root is sqrt(4)=2 and sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So x = 2e-6.5. What's 1e-6.5? Hmm, 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Wait, yeah, because 2 times 3.16 is about 6.32.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. That's the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That must be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with K = 5e10 = (0.02) / (x^2). So x^2 = 0.02/(5e10).

0.02 is 2e-2, so 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5)e-12 = 0.4e-12 =4e-13. So x² =4e-13, x=2e-6.5. Yeah, same as before.

So the concentration is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The equilibrium expression for the formation constant is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions that dissociate from the complex. Since the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and \( K \) is very large, the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration of the complex at equilibrium remains approximately 0.02 M. Thus:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} \approx 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \):

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
