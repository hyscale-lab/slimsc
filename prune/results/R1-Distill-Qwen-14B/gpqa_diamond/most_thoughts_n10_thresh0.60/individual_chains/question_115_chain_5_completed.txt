Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate each other and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and because of conservation laws, the total energy and momentum should be conserved. Since both photons have the same energy but are moving in opposite directions relative to each other, their angle apart should be determined by the initial momenta of the electron and positron.

Wait, but wait. Both are moving along the same horizontal axis but in opposite directions. The electron is moving left to right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving right to left (coming from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions along the same line.

I think I need to calculate the total momentum of the system before annihilation. Because after they annihilate, the photons will carry away that momentum. Since energy and momentum must be conserved.

Let me break it down. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, so gamma_e =4. The positron has gamma_p=2.

But wait, wait. Positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so it has the same mass but opposite charge. So for momentum, I need to calculate each particle's relativistic momentum.

The relativistic momentum p is given by p = gamma * m * v. But since v = c * beta, and gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2), maybe it's easier to remember that p = gamma m v, but perhaps it's better to express it in terms of gamma and mass, since I have the Lorentz factors.

Wait, but beta is v/c, so another formula is p = gamma m beta c. Because m is rest mass, and c is speed of light. So yeah.

But wait, the mass of the electron (and positron) is the same. So for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e. And for the positron, p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p. But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its momentum will be negative if I take the electron's direction as positive.

Wait, let's clarify directions. Let's take the positive x-direction as to the right. So the electron is moving to the right, from left to right. The positron is moving to the left, from right to left. So the positron's momentum is in the negative x-direction.

So I need to compute the total momentum before annihilation.

First, compute the beta for each. Gamma is given, so beta can be found from gamma = 1/sqrt(1-beta^2). Let's solve for beta.

For the electron (gamma_e=4):

gamma_e = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e²) → 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_e²) → sqrt(1 - beta_e²) = 1/4 → 1 - beta_e² = 1/16 → beta_e² = 15/16 → beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Similarly for the positron (gamma_p=2):

gamma_p = 2 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_p²) → sqrt(1 - beta_p²) = 1/2 → 1 - beta_p² = 1/4 → beta_p² = 3/4 → beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Now, the momenta:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e.

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p. But since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, p_p is negative. So p_p = -gamma_p * m_e * beta_p.

So total momentum P_total = p_e + p_p.

Let me compute each term:

p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) )= m_e * sqrt(15).

Because 4 * sqrt(15)/4 = sqrt(15).

p_p = -2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) )= - m_e * sqrt(3).

So P_total = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] * m_e.

Wait, because p_e is positive (to the right) and p_p is negative (to the left), so yes.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the positron's momentum. The positron is moving to the left, which is the negative x-direction. So its velocity is negative, so beta_p is positive but the direction is negative. So when computing p_p, it's gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * direction. So beta_p is positive, but the direction is negative, so p_p has a negative sign. So yes, p_p = - gamma_p * m_e * beta_p.

So substituting in the numbers:

p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) = m_e * sqrt(15).

p_p = -2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) )= - m_e sqrt(3).

So P_total = p_e + p_p = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, that's correct. So the total momentum after annihilation is this P_total, which must be carried by the two photons.

Now, each photon has energy E1 and E2. The problem says both photons have the same energy, so E1 = E2 = E.

Photons carry momentum p_photon = E / c. But since direction matters, we can express the momentum vectors.

The photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their momenta are at angles theta1 and theta2 relative to the x-axis, but in the right half-plane (since both are to the right). But wait, the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles are in the first and fourth quadrants relative to the positive x-axis.

Wait, but photons' momentum vectors are in the direction of propagation. So for photon 1, direction is upper-right, so its momentum vector is at some angle theta above the x-axis. Photon 2 is lower-right, so its angle is theta below the x-axis.

But given the symmetry, perhaps the two photons are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So their angles would be theta and -theta, making the angle between them 2 theta.

Wait, but the problem states the photons have same energy. So each has momentum E/c in magnitude. So their momentum vectors are (E/c) * (cos(theta), sin(theta)) and (E/c) * (cos(theta), -sin(theta)).

Now, the sum of the two photon momenta must equal the total momentum of the system before annihilation, which is P_total = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) in the x-direction (since in the initial system, the total momentum is along x).

But wait, wait a second. Because the initial system's momentum is along the x-axis. The photons' momenta have components in x and y. So when we sum the two photons' momenta, their y-components must cancel each other, and their x-components must add up to the total initial momentum.

So let's write the vector sum for the two photons.

Photon 1: (E/c) (cos(theta), sin(theta))
Photon 2: (E/c) (cos(theta'), sin(theta')) 

Wait, but the problem states that one is upper-right, another lower-right. So perhaps their angles are theta and -theta. But the question says 'the directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction.' So maybe they are symmetric around the x-axis. So their y-components are in opposite directions.

But the initial system's total momentum is along x. So the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.

So photon 1's y-momentum is (E/c) sin(theta), and photon 2's is (E/c) sin(theta'). But since they are in opposite directions, perhaps sin(theta') is negative. So if they're symmetric, sin(theta') = - sin(theta). So the sum is (E/c)(sin(theta) + sin(theta')) = 0.

Which would require sin(theta') = - sin(theta). So theta' = -theta, assuming both have the same magnitude.

So the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, each making an angle theta with respect to the x-axis, one above, the other below.

Then, their x-components add up, and their y-components cancel.

So the sum of their momenta in the x-direction is (E/c) [ cos(theta) + cos(theta') ] = (E/c) [ cos(theta) + cos(-theta) ] = (E/c)(2 cos(theta)).

And since the total momentum of the system is along x, the sum of the photons' x-momenta must equal the initial momentum. So:

(E/c) * 2 cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait no. Wait the initial momentum after annihilation is P_total = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] m_e. So the sum of the photons' momenta must be equal to P_total.

Wait, but wait, the initial momentum is in the direction of the electron's motion, which is to the right. The positron is moving to the left, so the positron's momentum is negative.

Wait, but when I calculated P_total, I think I had the correct sign. Let me recheck.

Electron momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e, direction positive x.

Positron momentum p_p = - gamma_p m_e beta_p, direction negative x.

So P_total = p_e + p_p = m_e [ 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) ) - 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) ) ].

Wait, 4*(sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15), and 2*(sqrt(3)/2)= sqrt(3). So P_total = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So the sum of the photons' momenta must be equal to this.

Each photon's momentum is E/c in magnitude. So the sum of their x-components is (E/c)(cos(theta) + cos(theta')).

But wait, I thought since one is upper-right and the other lower-right, they could have angles theta and -theta.

Wait, no, that's only if they're symmetric. But perhaps they are not symmetric. Wait, but the problem says both photons have the same energy. So each photon's momentum magnitude is the same.

So, since each photon's momentum is E/c, and same E, both have same magnitude. So their vectors have same length but different angles.

But the problem states that one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their x-components would be in the same direction (right) but perhaps different angles, but their y-components would be in opposite directions.

Wait, but the initial system's total momentum is along the x-axis. So the total momentum of the photons must be along the x-axis. So their y-components must cancel each other.

So, the sum of the y-components of the photons' momenta must be zero.

Photon 1's y-component: (E/c) sin(theta1).

Photon 2's y-component: (E/c) sin(theta2).

Sum: (E/c) [ sin(theta1) + sin(theta2) ] = 0.

So sin(theta1) = - sin(theta2).

Possible solutions: theta2 = - theta1, meaning that the two angles are symmetric around the x-axis.

But wait, the problem says one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So their angles theta1 and theta2 are in the first and fourth quadrants, respectively.

So, theta2 = - theta1.

So, their y-components are negatives of each other, hence sum to zero.

Now, the x-components add up. So sum of x-components is (E/c)( cos(theta1) + cos(theta2) ) = (E/c)( cos(theta) + cos(-theta) ) = 2 (E/c) cos(theta).

Because theta2 is -theta, so cos(theta2) = cos(theta).

So the total x-momentum is 2 (E/c) cos(theta) = P_total = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

From this, we can solve for cos(theta):

cos(theta) = [ m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c ] / ( 2 E ) .

Now, let's think about the energy. The total energy of the system before annihilation must equal the total energy after.

The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each particle's energy is gamma m c².

So, E_electron = gamma_e m_e c² = 4 m_e c².

E_positron = gamma_p m_e c² = 2 m_e c².

Total energy before annihilation: (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons.

Since both photons have the same energy E, the total energy is 2E.

So,

2E = 6 m_e c² → E = 3 m_e c².

So substituting back into the expression for cos(theta):

cos(theta) = [ m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c ] / ( 2 * 3 m_e c² )

Simplify: the m_e and c terms cancel.

cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) / ( 6 c * (1/c² )) ) → Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.

Wait, the denominator is 2E, which is 6 m_e c². So E=3 m_e c^2.

So,

cos(theta) = [ m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) c ] / (2 * 3 m_e c² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Denominator: 6 m_e c².

So,

cos(theta) = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / [ 6 m_e c² ]

The m_e cancels, and c in numerator cancels with one c in denominator, leaving 1/c.

Wait, that can't be right because cos(theta) is dimensionless. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let's correct the calculation.

Wait, the units. Let me think again. The momentum P_total is in kg·m/s. The photons' momenta are E/c in kg·m/s, since E = pc → p=E/c.

But wait, when I set up the equation:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, the units on the left are (E/c) which is (Joule)/(m/s) )= (kg·m²/s²)/(m/s) )= kg·m/s → which is momentum, correct.

On the right, m_e is kg, and (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) is dimensionless, so the right side is kg, which doesn't match. Oh wait, no. Wait, the initial momentum P_total has units of kg·m/s. So I must have messed up the substitution.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to include the c in the momentum expression. Let me re-express P_total correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should work in terms of natural units where c=1, but maybe it's easier to avoid confusion by keeping track of units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total momentum using relativistic equations correctly.

Wait, earlier I may have made a mistake in the units. Let me think again.

The momentum of each particle is p = gamma * m_e * beta * c.

Because, since beta = v/c, and momentum p = gamma m v = gamma m (beta c) = gamma m beta c.

So, p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Wait no, wait a second. Because beta_e is sqrt(15)/4.

Wait, wait, beta_e we found as sqrt(15)/4. So, beta_e = v_e / c → v_e = c * beta_e.

So, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = gamma_e m_e (beta_e c) )= gamma_e m_e beta_e c.

So, for the electron:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4.

So, p_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) * c = m_e * sqrt(15) * c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum: gamma_p=2, beta_p = sqrt(3)/2.

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p * c → 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) * c = m_e sqrt(3) c.

But since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. So p_p = - m_e sqrt(3) c.

So the total initial momentum is p_e + p_p = [ m_e sqrt(15) c ] + [ - m_e sqrt(3) c ] = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ).

So, P_total = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) → units are kg·m/s, which is correct.

Now, the photons' momenta sum to P_total.

Each photon's momentum is p_photon = E/c → because E = p c → p = E/c.

Wait, no, that's correct. So, the photon's momentum vector is in the direction of propagation. So, the two photons' momenta are vectors, and their sum must equal P_total.

So, the sum of the x-components of the two photons' momenta must be P_total.

Each photon's momentum is (E/c) in magnitude. Let me denote their directions.

Photon 1: angle theta above x-axis → its momentum is (E/c) [ cos(theta), sin(theta) ].

Photon 2: angle phi below x-axis → its momentum is (E/c) [ cos(phi), -sin(phi) ] (since it's symmetric, perhaps phi = theta, but I'm not sure yet).

Wait, but the problem says the photons have same energy, so each has the same |p|, which is E/c.

So, the sum of the x-components must be:

(E/c) cos(theta) + (E/c) cos(phi) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

And the sum of the y-components must be:

(E/c) sin(theta) - (E/c) sin(phi) = 0 → sin(theta) = sin(phi).

But because the photons are moving in opposite directions in y, perhaps they're symmetric. So, if theta is the angle above the x-axis, then phi could be the same angle below, so phi = theta, but opposite in sign.

Wait, but that would make sin(phi) = -sin(theta). So plugging into the y-component equation:

(E/c) sin(theta) + (E/c) (-sin(theta)) ) = 0 → which is 0, so that's correct.

So yes, the two photons can be symmetric, meaning their angles are +theta and -theta.

So, their x-components are (E/c) cos(theta) each, and their sum is 2 (E/c) cos(theta).

So, the equation becomes:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

We can solve for cos(theta):

cos(theta) = [ m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ] / ( 2 (E/c) )

Wait, let's write it correctly:

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

So,

cos(theta) = [ m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ] / ( 2 (E/c) ) )

Wait, because the denominator is 2 (E/c). So,

cos(theta) = [ m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ] / [ 2 (E/c) ) ]

Which is m_e c^2 ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ) / ( 2 E )

Now, E for each photon is E = 3 m_e c², as we found earlier.

So,

cos(theta) = [ m_e c^2 ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) ] / ( 2 * 3 m_e c² )

Simplify:

The m_e c^2 terms cancel, so:

cos(theta) = ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ) / 6

Hmm, let's compute that.

Calculate numerator: sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205 → 3.87298 -1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

So,

cos(theta) ≈ 2.14093 / 6 ≈ 0.35682.

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.35682).

What's arccos(0.35682)? Let me think, cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(70°) is about 0.3420, which is lower than 0.3568. So theta is approximately between 69 and 70 degrees? Let me check with a calculator:

Using a calculator, cos(theta) = 0.35682 → theta ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, wait, 69 degrees is about 69°, so the angle each photon makes with the x-axis is roughly 69 degrees above and below.

But wait, the question asks for the angle between the two photons. Since one is at +69 degrees, the other at -69 degrees, the angle between them is 69 + 69 = 138 degrees.

Wait, that makes sense. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C) is 138 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for cos(theta):

sqrt(15) is approximately 3.872983, sqrt(3) is 1.7320508.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = ~2.140932.

Divide by 6: 2.140932 /6 ≈ 0.356822.

So cos(theta) = 0.356822 → theta ≈ 69 degrees.

So the two photons are each at 69 degrees above and below the x-axis. So the angle between them is 2 * 69 = 138 degrees, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of the electron and positron, ensuring conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron move along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy, moving in upper-right and lower-right directions. The goal is to determine the angle between the photons' directions.

### Step 1: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum of the system before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relativistic momentum formula \( p = \gamma m \beta c \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \beta = v/c \), and \( m \) is the rest mass:

- **Electron**: \( \gamma_e = 4 \), \( \beta_e = \sqrt{15}/4 \), so \( p_e = \gamma_e m_e \beta_e c = m_e \sqrt{15} c \).
- **Positron**: \( \gamma_p = 2 \), \( \beta_p = \sqrt{3}/2 \), so \( p_p = \gamma_p m_e \beta_p c = m_e \sqrt{3} c \). Since the positron moves left, its momentum is negative: \( p_p = -m_e \sqrt{3} c \).

The total momentum is:
\[
P_{\text{total}} = p_e + p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

### Step 2: Conservation of Energy
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the relativistic energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
\]
After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons, so each photon has energy:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m_e c^2.
\]

### Step 3: Photon Momentum and Directions
Each photon has momentum \( p_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{photon}} / c = 3m_e c \). Let the angles of the photons above and below the x-axis be \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \), respectively. The x-components of their momenta add, while the y-components cancel due to symmetry:
\[
\text{Total x-momentum: } 2 \cdot \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Substituting \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3m_e c^2 \):
\[
2 \cdot \frac{3m_e c^2}{c} \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}),
\]
\[
6m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Cancel \( m_e c \) and solve for \( \cos\theta \):
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between Photons
Using a calculator:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.872, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732, \quad \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.141.
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.357.
\]
\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.357) \approx 69^\circ.
\]
The two photons are symmetrically placed at \( +69^\circ \) and \( -69^\circ \) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:
\[
2\theta = 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138°**.
