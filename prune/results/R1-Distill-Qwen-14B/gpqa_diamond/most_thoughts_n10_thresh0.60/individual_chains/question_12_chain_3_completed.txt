Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the decay of a pion, Pi(+) into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The equation given is Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. And it's stated that the Pi(+) is stationary. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D, each with two values, probably for the muon and neutrino.

First, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think for the purpose of these problems, neutrinos are considered to be massless. So the muon would carry away some kinetic energy, and the neutrino would take the rest. Or wait, no, the muon has rest mass, so the neutrino's energy would be related to its momentum.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion. Since it's stationary, its kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I can ignore it.

So the initial energy is 139.6 MeV. This must equal the sum of the energies of the muon (which includes its rest mass and kinetic energy) and the neutrino's energy.

Let me denote:
E_mu = energy of muon = KE_mu + m_mu c²
E_nu = energy of neutrino = p_nu c (since m_nu is zero)

And from momentum conservation, the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal: p_mu = p_nu.

Because the muon is not massless, its momentum is related to its energy and mass by E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)².

So, let's set up the equations.

From energy conservation:
E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c²
=> (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)² )^(1/2) + p_nu c = m_pi c²

But since p_mu = p_nu = p (let's say), we can substitute.

So,

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c²

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. Wait, but that might get complicated. Maybe it's better to simplify variables by dividing both sides by c².

Let me define x = p c, and M = m_pi c², m = m_mu c².

So the equation becomes:

sqrt( x^2 + m^2 ) + x = M

Hmm, let's subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + m²) = M - x

Then square both sides:

x² + m² = (M - x)^2 = M² - 2 M x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

m² = M² - 2 M x

Rearranged:

2 M x = M² - m²

So, x = (M² - m²)/(2 M)

So, x is ( (139.6)^2 - (105.7)^2 ) / (2 * 139.6 )

Let me compute M² (139.6^2) and m² (105.7^2).

139.6 squared: Let's compute 140^2 is 19600, but 139.6 is 140 - 0.4. So (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b².

So 139.6² = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Similarly, 105.7^2: Let's see, 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Then x = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So 29.8 something.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = 279.2*(30 - 0.2) )= 8376 - (279.2 *0.2)= 8376-55.84=8320.16.

Hmm, that's a bit more than 8315.67. Let me try 29.7.

279.2 * 29.7 = 279.2 * (30 -0.3) )=8376 - (279.2 *0.3)= 8376 - 83.76= 8292.24.

So 8315.67 is between 29.7 and 29.8. Let's take 29.75 as a guess.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8

Subtracting from 8315.67, 8315.67-8096.8=218.87.

Now, 279.2 *0.78= approximately 279.2 *0.7=195.44, 279.2 *0.08=22.336 → total 217.776.

Which is close to 218.87. So 29.78.

So x ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

So x is p c = ~29.78 MeV/c → p ≈ 29.78 MeV/(c² * c) → wait, no, units-wise, x is in MeV, since p c has units of MeV. So p = x / c, but when working with units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c²), p is in MeV/c. So x is p c, so p = x / (c), but in units where c=1, p is just x. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Anyway, now that we have x ≈ 29.78 MeV, that's the momentum of the neutrino times c, since neutrino's momentum is p_nu = x / c² → wait, no, in units where c=1, E = sqrt( p² + m² ), but since neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu. So E_nu = p_nu c, because in standard units E = pc. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with units. Let's go back.

In our setup, x = p c. So for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c = x (because p_nu = p_mu = x/(c) )? Wait, no, because we set p_mu = p_nu = p. So if x = p c, then p = x / (c). So for the neutrino, E_nu = p_nu c = (x/c) * c = x. So E_nu = x = ~29.78 MeV.

Then, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2 )^2 ) = sqrt( x² + m_mu² c^4 ) / c^2 ? Wait, no, let's get the units right. Alternatively, since E_mu is in MeV, m_mu c^2 is 105.7 MeV, and x is in MeV.

So E_mu = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ≈ sqrt ( 887 + 11172.49 ) → sqrt(12059.49) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

So E_mu is about 109.8 MeV. But the rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy for the muon is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.1 MeV.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately. 29.78^2 is 29.78 *29.78. Let me compute 30^2=900, but minus (0.22)^2 and some cross terms. Alternatively, 29.78^2 = (30 - 0.22)^2=900 - 2*30*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 900 - 13.2 + 0.0484 = 887.  So 29.78^2 ≈ 887. Then 887 + 105.7^2=887+11172.49=12059.49. The square root of 12059.49 is sqrt(12059.49). Let me compute sqrt(12100)=110, so sqrt(12059.49) is a bit less, maybe 109.8? Let's compute 109.8^2: 100^2=10000, 9.8^2=96.04, 2*100*9.8=1960. So (100+9.8)^2=10000 + 1960 + 96.04=119, 556.04. Wait, that can't be right because 109.8^2 is (100+9.8)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*9.8 +9.8^2=10000 + 1960 + 96.04=11956.04. Wait, but our value is 12059.49.

So 109.8^2=11956.04, which is less than 12059.49. The difference is about 103.45. Let's see how much more we need to go.

Each 0.1 increase in E_mu adds about 2*109.8*0.1 + (0.1)^2 = 21.96 + 0.01 = 21.97 to the square. So how much do we need? 103.45 / 219.6 → approximately 0.47. So about 0.47 added to 109.8 → 110.27? Wait, wait, that's probably not the right way. Maybe use a better approximation.

Alternatively, let me compute 109.8^2 = 11956.04. The target is 12059.49. So the delta is 12059.49 - 11956.04 = 103.45. Let's denote E_mu = 109.8 + d. Then (109.8 + d)^2 = 11956.04 + 2*109.8*d + d² = 12059.49.

So 2*109.8*d ≈ 103.45 (since d² is small, we can neglect it for an approximate calculation). So 219.6 d ≈ 103.45 → d ≈ 103.45 / 219.6 ≈ 0.472.

So E_mu ≈ 109.8 + 0.472 ≈ 110.272 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 110.27 MeV. Hence, KE_mu is E_mu - m_mu c² = 110.27 - 105.7 = 4.57 MeV.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 4.1 MeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.

Wait, I think I might have miscalculated x. Let me compute x = (M² - m²) / (2 M) again.

M is 139.6 MeV, m is 105.7 MeV.

M² = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 MeV².

m² = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 MeV².

M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Divide by 2M: 8315.67 / (2 * 139.6) → 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let me compute that more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So x = 29.782 MeV.

So x is 29.782 MeV.

So E_nu = x c → but in our units, since x is p c, E_nu = x. So E_nu =29.782 MeV.

Then E_mu = sqrt( x^2 + m_mu^2 ) → sqrt( (29.782)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) → compute 29.782^2:

29^2=841. 0.782^2≈0.612. Cross term 2*29*0.782≈44.668. So 841 +44.668 +0.612 = 886.28.

So 886.28 + 105.7^2 (11172.49) = 12058.77.

E_mu = sqrt(12058.77) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, that's 109.81 MeV. So KE_mu is 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

So the muon's KE is approximately 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's energy is approximately 29.78 MeV.

Wait, the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, but what about its kinetic energy? Well, since neutrinos have negligible mass, their energy is almost entirely kinetic. So in this context, the neutrino's energy is its KE.

But looking at the options:

Options:

A) 2.84 MeV, 26.8 MeV

B)7.2 MeV,32.8 MeV

C)3.52 MeV,20.8 MeV

D)4.12 MeV,29.8 MeV

So the options are probably giving the KE of the muon and the neutrino.

So our calculation gives mu KE ≈4.11 MeV and neutrino KE≈29.78 MeV. Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 and 29.8, which matches closely. So the answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energies of the decay products in the pion decay process:

**Given:**
- Rest mass of the pion, \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Rest mass of the muon, \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
- The pion is stationary, so total momentum before decay is zero.

### Key Conservation Laws:
1. **Energy Conservation**: Total energy before decay equals the total energy after decay.
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}
   \]
   where \( E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 \), \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} \), and \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c \) (since the neutrino is massless).

2. **Momentum Conservation**: Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite:
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p
   \]

### Solving for \( p \):
From energy conservation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m_{\mu}^2 c^4} + p c = m_{\pi} c^2
\]
Dividing through by \( c^2 \) and simplifying:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}
\]
Let \( x = p \). Then:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - x
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} x + x^2
\]
Simplifying:
\[
2 m_{\pi} x = m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2
\]
\[
x = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}
\]
Substituting values:
\[
m_{\pi}^2 = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2, \quad m_{\mu}^2 = (105.7)^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2
\]
\[
x = \frac{19488.16 - 11172.49}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Calculating Energies:
1. **Neutrino Energy**: Since \( E_{\nu} = p_{\nu} c = x \):
   \[
   E_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   (The neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately equal to its energy since its mass is negligible.)

2. **Muon Energy**: Using \( E_{\mu} = \sqrt{x^2 + m_{\mu}^2} \):
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2} = \sqrt{886.28 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12058.77} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
   \]
   The muon's kinetic energy is:
   \[
   \text{KE}_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

### Final Results:
- Kinetic energy of the muon: \( \text{KE}_{\mu} \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \)
- Kinetic energy of the neutrino: \( \text{KE}_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \)

### Matching with Options:
The closest match is **Option D**: \( 4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \).

**Answer: D**
