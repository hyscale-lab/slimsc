Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about reactions and chromatography, which I'm still getting the hang of. Let's see what the question says.

The question involves two reactions using (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard (achiral) and chiral ones. The options are about how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is an addition reaction where the double bond is converted into an epoxide. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide.

Wait, but mCPBA can also cause other reactions. Oh right, in some cases, especially with more substituted alkenes or under certain conditions, mCPBA can lead to dihydroxylation, forming a vicinal diol. Oh wait, wait no, that's probably when using something like OsO4 or another oxidizing agent. For epoxidation, mCPBA is more about making the epoxide.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh, right! That's important. Because when epoxides are treated with acid, they can undergo ring-opening reactions. So the initial epoxide is formed, then under acidic conditions, it might protonate and open up.

So for each reaction, the initial product is an epoxide. Let me think about the structure of (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 in positions 4 and 5. For (E), the two substituents on either end are opposite each other. So (E)-oct-4-ene would have two CH2CH2CH2 groups on either end, but the substituents (like the other carbons) would be opposite. Similarly, (Z) would have them on the same side.

When mCPBA reacts with each, it adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would form in a certain way, and for (Z), another.

Wait, but when the epoxide is formed, what happens when it's treated with aqueous acid? Oh right, the epoxide ring opens. The acid catalyzes the nucleophilic attack. But which side does the attack happen on?

Epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions usually involves the more substituted carbon being attacked because the carbocation is more stable there. Or wait, maybe it's the less substituted because of the transition state? Hmm, I'm a little fuzzy on that. Let's think.

In an epoxide, the more substituted carbon (the one with more R groups attached) would lead to a more stable carbocation upon ring opening. So under acid-catalyzed conditions, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making the ring more strained, and the most substituted carbon would break open, leading to the formation of a carbocation there.

So for each epoxide, upon treatment with acid, it would form a diol, specifically a trans-diol because the attack occurs from the opposite side (like a cyclic transition state). Wait, no, maybe it's a trans configuration. Let me think.

Wait, when the epoxide is formed, the two oxygen atoms are connected to adjacent carbons. When acid is added, one of the oxygen's lone pairs attacks a hydrogen, creating a leaving group. Then, a carbocation forms (or maybe a transition state without a full carbocation). The nucleophile (water, in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon from the opposite side, leading to a trans addition.

So for each starting alkene, the epoxide would form, and then the acid would cause it to open into a diol with a certain configuration.

Let me think about the structures.

Original alkenes are (E) and (Z) oct-4-enes. Structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2, but with substituents on either side. Let me write it more clearly.

(E)-oct-4-ene: CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2, but the substituents (CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3?) Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should structure it as CH2CH2 in position 4. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, octane is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. So structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH2CH2 groups on both sides. Actually, for oct-4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's better to write it as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of oct-4-ene as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C4 and C5. So (E) configuration would have the higher priority groups on opposite sides. The substituents on C4 and C5 would be CH2CH2CH2CH3 and CH2CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps that's not necessary for this problem.

When mCPBA adds to the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans-epoxide. Similarly, (Z)-oct-4-ene would form a cis-epoxide.

Wait, wait, no. mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry is retained. Because mCPBA adds via an electrocyclic opening, leading to an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, no. Actually, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, creating an epoxide. The addition is stereospecific. So if the starting alkene is (E), the resulting epoxide will have the two new bonds adding with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Or maybe the opposite? Hmm.

Wait, the addition of mCPBA is via a cyclic transition state. The endo transition state leads to the formation of the epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide is determined by the geometry of the starting alkene. So for a trans (E) starting alkene, the epoxide will be a cis or trans epoxide?

Wait, no, the starting alkene's geometry affects the approach of mCPBA. The peracid adds to the same face of the double bond because of the way the transition state forms. So for a (E) double bond, the two substituents are opposite. So when the peracid adds, the oxygen adds from the same face, leading to a trans epoxide? Or wait, maybe the opposite.

Wait, I think that the epoxide's configuration is such that the two new substituents (the oxygen atoms) are on the same side as the substituents on the starting alkene. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when a trans double bond (E) reacts with mCPBA, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of an example. For (E)-2-butene, adding mCPBA would form an epoxide. The (E) geometry has the two methyl groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that the two oxygen atoms are on the same face, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide?

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's stereochemistry is the same as the alkene's. So (E) leads to a trans epoxide, (Z) leads to a cis epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should imagine the transition state. The peracid (mCPBA) adds across the double bond in a concerted manner. The oxygen atoms end up on the same face as the substituents. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, which has substituents on opposite sides, the epoxide would form with the two new oxygens on opposite sides, making it a trans epoxide. Wait, that can't be right because the double bond is between C4 and C5. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps it's better to proceed with the assumption that the epoxide's configuration depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Regardless, the next step is the acid treatment. When the epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, it undergoes ring-opening. The ring opens via a protonation of the epoxide oxygen, creating a better leaving group (water). Then, water attacks one of the carbons in an SN2-like fashion, leading to the formation of a diol.

The question is, which carbon is attacked? The more substituted carbon, because the transition state is more stable if the carbocation (or the partial positive charge) is on the more substituted carbon. So for each epoxide, the attack occurs on the more substituted carbon.

But wait, in the case of symmetric epoxides, like where both carbons are equally substituted, it might not matter. But oct-4-ene is symmetric, so the epoxide would be symmetric too. So each epoxide would open in the same way regardless of the starting geometry. Hmm, maybe that's not correct.

Wait, oct-4-ene is not symmetric. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps it's more accurately written as CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the substituents on each end are different. Wait, no, wait oct-4-ene is actually CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, maybe I'm not writing it correctly. Let me try again. Octene has 8 carbons. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: positions 1 to 8.

1  2  3  4  5  6 7 8

So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, maybe:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3

Wait, perhaps I should write it as CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but I'm not getting the substituents right. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same. Because oct-4-ene has two CH2CH2 groups on either end of the double bond.

Wait, so for oct-4-ene, each end of the double bond (C4 and C5) have CH2CH2 groups attached. So the substituents on each end are the same—CH2CH2CH2 groups? Or maybe CH2CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think of oct-4-ene as:

CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH2)2CH-CH2-CH2(CH2)3CH3? Hmm, no, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should instead think that when the epoxide forms, each of the two carbons in the epoxide has two substituents besides the oxygen. So for oct-4-ene, each of the epoxide carbons (C4 and C5) is connected to two CH2 groups and two CH2CH2 groups. So each is equally substituted. Therefore, when the epoxide opens under acidic conditions, the attack can occur on either carbon, leading to diastereomers.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the ring-opening would lead to the same product regardless of which carbon is attacked. So perhaps the diol formed is the same for each epoxide.

Wait, no, because the starting epoxides from (E) and (Z) alkenes might have different configurations.

Wait, let's think again. (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on the same face as the substituents. Or maybe it's the opposite. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide formed from (E) and (Z) alkenes have different configurations, leading to different diol products when treated with acid.

Wait, perhaps the key here is that the epoxide's configuration affects the diol structure upon acid treatment. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide might be trans, while for (Z), it's cis. Then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, the diol formed would have different configurations.

Wait, but if the epoxide is trans, the ring-opening under acid would lead to a trans diol. Let me think: when the epoxide is trans, the two oxygen atoms are on opposite sides. So upon opening, the nucleophile (water) attacks each carbon from opposite sides, leading to a trans diol. Wait, no, in an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, the attack occurs from the opposite side because of the transition state.

Wait, no, the ring-opening of an epoxide under acid conditions typically forms a trans-diol. Because the nucleophilic attack occurs on the more substituted carbon from the opposite side, leading to a trans arrangement of the hydroxyl groups.

Wait, or perhaps it's the same as the epoxide's configuration. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol formed is a vicinal diol with both hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans) based on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, no, perhaps the ring-opening of a cis epoxide leads to a trans diol, and the ring-opening of a trans epoxide leads to a cis diol? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, I think I'm confusing things. Let's try to think of a specific example. For example, consider cis-2,3-epoxybutane. When treated with acid, which diol forms?

The epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same face. Upon protonation, the ring opens. The attack by water would be from the opposite face, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on opposite sides. So cis epoxide would lead to trans diol.

Similarly, a trans epoxide would lead to a cis diol.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So if the epoxide is trans, the diol would be cis, and if the epoxide is cis, the diol is trans.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration and the attack's stereochemistry.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think that regardless of the epoxide's configuration, the acid-catalyzed ring-opening leads to a trans-diol. Because the attack is from the opposite side, leading to the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The configuration of the diol depends on the epoxide's configuration and the direction of attack.

In the epoxide, the two oxygen atoms are on adjacent carbons. When the epoxide is opened, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon from the side opposite to the leaving oxygen. So for a cis epoxide, which has both oxygens on the same face, the attack would lead to hydroxyls on opposite sides.

Wait, maybe I should look at a specific example:

Take cis-2,3-epoxybutane. The structure is where both oxygen atoms are on the same face. When acid is added, the epoxide oxygen is protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon (C2 or C3, assuming they are equally substituted in this example) from the opposite side. So the hydroxyl groups would end up on opposite sides, leading to a trans diol.

Similarly, if the epoxide is trans, the oxygens are on opposite faces. The attack from the opposite sides would lead to the hydroxyl groups being on the same face, leading to a cis diol.

Wait, that makes sense. So the diol's configuration is opposite to the epoxide's configuration. So a cis epoxide becomes a trans diol, and a trans epoxide becomes a cis diol.

Therefore, in our problem:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (trans, since E is trans) → diol (cis upon acid treatment).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (cis) → diol (trans upon acid treatment).

Wait, no. Because (E) is trans, the epoxide would be trans, leading to a cis diol. And (Z) is cis, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, but wait. Let's make it clear.

Original alkene:

- (E)-oct-4-ene: substituents on opposite sides → trans double bond.

When mCPBA adds, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the alkene because the addition is stereospecific. So the epoxide would also be trans.

So for Reaction 1: (E) → trans epoxide.

Upon acid treatment, the trans epoxide opens to form a cis diol.

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z) → cis epoxide.

Upon acid treatment, the cis epoxide opens to form a trans diol.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought that a cis epoxide leads to a trans diol and a trans epoxide leads to a cis diol. So that would mean (E) → trans epoxide → cis diol, (Z) → cis epoxide → trans diol.

Yes, that's correct.

So the products are:

- From (E) alkene: cis-diol.

- From (Z) alkene: trans-diol.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me think again.

Suppose the starting alkene is (E), which is trans. The epoxide formed would have the oxygens on the same face as the substituents. No, wait, I'm not getting this right. Maybe I should draw it, but since I can't, I'll have to visualize.

When mCPBA adds to a double bond, the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen atoms are syn to the substituents. So, for a trans (E) double bond, the substituents are on opposite sides, so the oxygen atoms would be on the same face.

Wait, no, because the double bond is in a certain conformation. Let's consider the double bond in (E) configuration: substituents R and R' are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it approaches from the same face, leading to the two new C-O bonds being on the same face, thus creating a trans epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the double bond as being flat. mCPBA approaches from one face, adding two oxygen atoms on that face. So for a trans (E) double bond, the substituents are on opposite faces. So when mCPBA adds from the same face, the substituents on the same face would have the oxygen atoms on that face, leading to a cis epoxide. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the epoxide is opposite to that of the alkene. So (E) gives a cis epoxide, and (Z) gives a trans epoxide. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide's configuration is the same as the alkene's. So (E) leads to a trans epoxide, (Z) leads to a cis epoxide.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to note that when mCPBA adds to a trans (E) double bond, the epoxide formed is cis, and when it adds to a cis (Z) double bond, the epoxide is trans. Or is it the opposite?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck on this point, but perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the epoxide's configuration is the same as the alkene's. So (E) gives a trans epoxide, (Z) gives a cis epoxide.

Then, when treated with acid, each epoxide would form a diol with the opposite configuration.

So (E) → trans epoxide → cis diol.

(Z) → cis epoxide → trans diol.

So the products are:

- From Reaction 1: cis-diol.

- From Reaction 2: trans-diol.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is a symmetric molecule. So the diols formed from each reaction might have identical structures, but different configurations.

Wait, no, because the diols from Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would have different configurations.

Wait, but maybe the diols are enantiomers. Because if you have a diol with two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons in a certain configuration, the other diol would be its mirror image.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are different stereoisomers.

Wait, but if the diols are on adjacent carbons, the configuration would determine if they are cis or trans.

Wait, the diol from (E) would be cis (adjacent OH groups on same side), and the diol from (Z) would be trans (adjacent OH groups on opposite sides).

Wait, but earlier I thought that (E) gives a trans epoxide, which then gives a cis diol, and (Z) gives a cis epoxide, which gives a trans diol. Hmm.

So if that's the case, the products are two different diastereomers: one cis, one trans.

But wait, are they enantiomers or diastereomers?

Wait, no, because if you have two adjacent OH groups, their configuration could lead to different stereoisomers.

Wait, let me think about the structure. If the diol is on C4 and C5, then the four possible stereoisomers are based on the configuration of C4 and C5.

Wait, actually, for a 1,2-diol (vicinal diol), there are two possible configurations: the OH groups can be on the same side (cis, R,R or S,S) or on opposite sides (trans, R,S or S,R).

Wait, but in the case of the epoxide derived from (E) oct-4-ene, the diol formed is cis. So the diol has both OH groups on the same side, making it a cis-diol, which has two enantiomers (R,R and S,S), which are actually the same compound because of the molecule's symmetry. Wait, because the molecule is symmetric, the (R,R) and (S,S) configurations are the same. So the cis-diol would be a single compound.

Similarly, the trans-diol would have OH groups on opposite sides. Again, because of the molecule's symmetry, the (R,S) and (S,R) configurations are the same, so the trans-diol is a single compound.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the structure. The molecule is symmetric around the C4-C5 axis. So when you have a diol on C4 and C5, the molecule is symmetric. So the configuration at C4 and C5 would mirror each other.

Thus, the cis-diol would have both OH groups on the same face. But because the molecule is symmetric, this would be a single compound, either (R,R) or (S,S), but they are enantiomers. Wait, no, wait. If the molecule is symmetric, then a cis-diol would have both OH groups on the same side, but since the molecule is symmetric, it's not chiral. Or is it?

Wait, a molecule can have a plane of symmetry. If the diol is on C4 and C5, and the substituents on either side are the same, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So the diol would be achiral.

Wait, no. Wait, if the diol is on C4 and C5, and each has an OH group on the same face, then the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making it achiral. Because the two OH groups are mirror images of each other across the center. So the cis-diol would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

Similarly, the trans-diol would have the OH groups on opposite faces. In this case, the molecule would also be achiral because it has a plane of symmetry. Wait, no. Wait, if the two OH groups are on opposite faces, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then yes. For example, if the diol is trans, and the substituents on either end are the same, the molecule would be achiral. Because the mirror image would be the same as the original.

Wait, but that's only true if the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Octane is a symmetric molecule. So the diol, regardless of being cis or trans, would have a plane of symmetry. So both diols are achiral.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Suppose you have a diol on C4 and C5. The molecule is symmetric, so if the diol is cis, then the left and right sides are mirror images. Thus, the molecule is achiral. Similarly, if the diol is trans, the left and right are mirror images, making it achiral as well.

Wait, but that would mean that both diols are achiral, which can't be right because the diols are formed from different epoxides. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are actually chiral. Let's think: if the diol is on C4 and C5, and the substituents on either side are different, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But in our case, the substituents are the same on either side of the diol.

Wait, let's take an example. Take (R,R) configuration on C4 and C5. If the substituents on C4 and C5 are the same on each side, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Similarly, (S,S) would be the same as (R,R) due to symmetry, so it's not a separate compound.

Wait, but if the diol is on C4 and C5, and the substituents are symmetric, then the molecule is achiral. So the diol from (E)-oct-4-ene is a meso compound (cis diol, achiral), and the diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene is another meso compound (trans diol, achiral).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because (E) and (Z) would lead to different diols. So perhaps each diol is a single compound, but their configurations are different.

Wait, but if both diols are achiral, then when they are combined, the mixture would contain two different achiral compounds.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to step back.

The problem states that Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 go to 100% completion. So each reaction produces a single diol product.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans epoxide → upon acid, cis diol (which is a meso compound, so one product, achiral).

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis epoxide → upon acid, trans diol (which is also a meso compound, so one product, achiral).

Wait, but if both diols are meso compounds, they are achiral. So when you combine the products of both reactions, you have two different achiral diols.

Wait, but that can't be right because the diols from (E) and (Z) would be different.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a pair of enantiomers. But if the molecule is symmetric, the diol would be achiral. So each reaction produces a single achiral product.

So when the chemist combines the two products, she has two different achiral diols. Thus, when running them on an achiral HPLC column, each would elute as a single peak. So two peaks in total.

But wait, what if each diol has multiple stereoisomers?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the diol structure.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the diol formed is a cis-diol. Because the molecule is symmetric, the cis-diol is a meso compound, so it's achiral. So it's a single compound.

Similarly, the diol from (Z) is a trans-diol, which would also be a meso compound, hence achiral. So it's another single compound.

Thus, when the products are combined, there are two different diols, each achiral. So on a standard (achiral) HPLC column, each would give a single peak. So two peaks in total.

But what about a chiral HPLC column? A chiral column can separate enantiomers, but if the compounds are achiral, they would not be separated. So each diol would give a single peak on a chiral column. So two peaks in total.

Wait, but that would mean both chromatograms (standard and chiral) show two peaks. So the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both.

But looking at the options:

Option C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But another possibility is that each diol is actually a pair of enantiomers, but that would require the molecule to be chiral. But earlier analysis suggested the diols are meso, hence achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two enantiomeric diols, but in reality, the starting material is symmetric, so the diols are meso and thus achiral. So each reaction produces a single diol.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let me think again.

When the epoxide is opened, the diol's configuration depends on the attack direction. If the diol is on a symmetric molecule, then the attack from either side leads to the same product because the molecule is symmetric. So each reaction produces a single diol, which is a meso compound.

Thus, when the two diols are combined, there are two different meso compounds, each achiral. So on an achiral column, each is a single peak. So two peaks.

On a chiral column, which can separate enantiomers, but since these diols are achiral, they would not be separated. So each would elute as a single peak, again two peaks.

Thus, the chromatograms would each show two peaks.

Looking at the options, option C says 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But another possibility is that each diol is actually a pair of enantiomers, which would lead to more peaks.

Wait, but if the diol is meso, it's a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers. So each diol is a single compound. So when you run them on a chiral column, they would still be a single peak each.

Thus, the standard column shows two peaks, and the chiral column also shows two peaks.

So the answer would be option C.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides, and the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. The subsequent acid treatment causes the epoxide to undergo ring-opening, forming a vicinal diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the configuration of the starting epoxide.

### Reaction Analysis:
1. **(E)-oct-4-ene**:  
   - The (E)-isomer has a trans double bond.  
   - mCPBA adds across the double bond, forming a **trans-epoxide** due to the stereospecific nature of the reaction.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the trans-epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **cis-diol** (both hydroxyl groups on the same side of the molecule).  
   - The resulting cis-diol is a **meso compound** because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

2. **(Z)-oct-4-ene**:  
   - The (Z)-isomer has a cis double bond.  
   - mCPBA adds across the double bond, forming a **cis-epoxide** due to the stereospecific nature of the reaction.  
   - Under acidic conditions, the cis-epoxide undergoes ring-opening to form a **trans-diol** (hydroxyl groups on opposite sides of the molecule).  
   - The resulting trans-diol is also a **meso compound** because the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

### Product Mixture:
- The products of the two reactions are two different meso diols:  
  - A cis-diol from (E)-oct-4-ene.  
  - A trans-diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene.  
- Both diols are achiral because they are meso compounds.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Standard (Achiral) HPLC Column**:  
   - An achiral column cannot distinguish between enantiomers but can separate different compounds based on their physical properties (e.g., size, polarity).  
   - Since the two diols are different compounds, they will elute as **two separate peaks**.

2. **Chiral HPLC Column**:  
   - A chiral column is designed to separate enantiomers. However, since both diols are achiral meso compounds, they will not be separated into enantiomeric pairs.  
   - Each diol will elute as a single peak, resulting in **two separate peaks**.

### Conclusion:
- On both the standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns, the chemist will observe **two peaks** corresponding to the two different diols in the product mixture.
