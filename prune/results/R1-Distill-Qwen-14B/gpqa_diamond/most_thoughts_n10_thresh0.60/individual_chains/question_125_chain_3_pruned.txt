Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that in such a system, the potential is like a 3D version of a spring, where the force obeys Hooke's law. So, the particle is oscillating in all three dimensions (x, y, z) with the same frequency ω.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue.

Alright, so first, I think I should recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. I remember that in one dimension, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number (n=0,1,2,...).

But in three dimensions, things are a bit different. Since the potential is isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So, for 3D, the energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Hmm, wait, yeah, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them up gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, I think a more compact way to write this is using a total quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy becomes E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Now, the states are degenerate, meaning different combinations of n_x, n_y, n_z can give the same N and hence the same energy. The degeneracy (the number of distinct eigenfunctions for the same energy) depends on the value of N.

The question is about the third excited state. Wait, I need to clarify: in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy state, which is the first state. So the first excited state is the next one, and so on.

Wait, for the harmonic oscillator, each state is labeled by its energy level, which is determined by N. The ground state would be N=0, so E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be the next possible N, which is N=1. Then N=2 would be the second excited state, N=3 the third, and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, in 3D, each state is non-degenerate? No, each energy level is degenerate because multiple states can have the same N. So the ground state is N=0, which is non-degenerate? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, for N=0, the only possible combination is n_x=0, n_y=0, n_z=0. So that's one state, so the degeneracy is 1. For N=1, possible combinations are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So there
