Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states for the z-axis. So, first, I probably need to normalize this state because it's only proportional to that combination.

Wait, so to normalize, I find the norm of the vector (1+i, 2-i). The norm squared would be the sum of the absolute squares of each component. So (1+i) has a magnitude squared of (1² +1²)=2, and (2-i) has (2² + (-1)²)=4+1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next part: the operator whose matrix representation is Aij, where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that matrix look like? For a 2x2 matrix (since we're dealing with up and down), the diagonal elements are zero and the off-diagonals are hbar/2. So the matrix is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Hmm, that's a Pauli matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Oh wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this matrix A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

Wait, because sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, so A has eigenvalues (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), so hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So I probably need to express
