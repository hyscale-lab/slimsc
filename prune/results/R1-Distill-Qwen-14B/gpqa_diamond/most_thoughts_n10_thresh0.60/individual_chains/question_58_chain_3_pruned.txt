Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's think about what each option entails.

The question is about regularization, which I remember is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations result in infinite values. Regularization helps make these infinities manageable so you can renormalize the theory. So, the theory that never needs regularization would be one that doesn't have these divergences, or maybe is free from needing such techniques.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory: I know strings are one-dimensional objects, and superstrings are the supersymmetric versions. String theory operates at higher energies, but I'm not sure if it requires regularization. Wait, string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And it's a background-independent theory. But I remember that string theories, like Type I, II, etc., have different formulations. Oh, but wait, in perturbative string theory, the calculations are usually finite because higher-order terms don't lead to the same divergences as in point particle theories. Or do they? Or perhaps string theory handles things differently. Because in QFT, you have loop divergences, but in string theory, maybe the perturbative expansion is better behaved. So maybe string theories don't require regularization as much?

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, SU(3). I know that QCD does require regularization because when you calculate loop diagrams, you get divergences. For example, in beta functions and running couplings, you need to regularize the theory to handle those infinities. So QCD definitely requires regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a U(1) gauge theory. I remember that QED does have divergences, especially in higher-order Feynman diagrams. For instance, the electron has self-energy corrections which are divergent, so renormalization is necessary. So QED requires regularization.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: This is the non-quantum version, Maxwell's equations. Since it's classical, there are no quantum divergences or infinities to deal with. So regularization isn't needed here. Because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So classical theories don't require it.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So which of these options don't need it?

Option D, Classical Electrodynamics, doesn't involve quantum effects, so no regularization. But let me think about the other options.

Wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So, looking for the theory that doesn't need any regularization, meaning it's free from divergences.

Wait, another point: in quantum theories, renormalization is about handling divergences via regularization. So, if a theory is free, meaning it doesn't have interactions, like free QED or QCD, it doesn't require renormalization. But all the options here are interacting theories except maybe classical ED.

Wait, let me double-check. The question is about which theory never requires regularization. So, option D is classical ED, which doesn't use regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So it doesn't
