Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which option gives the correct sequence of reactions to achieve the desired product.

First, let me understand the target molecule. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, the benzene ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. At position 3, there's a bromine atom, and at position 5, a nitro group. Then, attached to the benzene is an ethanone group (a ketone). Wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one is a ketone. So the structure is benzene ring with substituents, and a ketone attached to carbon 1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So the benzene is attached to a ketone group, which is at position 1. Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me visualize it: the benzene ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group attached at position 1.

Wait, actually, perhaps I should draw the structure. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo
