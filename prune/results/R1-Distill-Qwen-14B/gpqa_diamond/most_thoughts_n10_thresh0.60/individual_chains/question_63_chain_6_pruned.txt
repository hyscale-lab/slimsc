Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about the momentum of a photon needed to switch the molecule from the fundamental state to the next lowest energy state. 

Wait, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, the energy states involve both rotational and vibrational levels. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe the bond isn't perfectly rigid. But the question mentions the fundamental state, which probably refers to the vibrational ground state.

So, the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state. To move to the next state, it would need to absorb a photon that provides enough energy to transition. But wait, the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, maybe that's the first excited state, which could be a rotational or vibrational transition.

Wait, no. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But in quantum mechanics, I think the vibrational transitions are usually higher energy because the vibrational energy levels are more spaced out than rotational ones. Or wait, no, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think.

The energy levels for rotation are quantized as E_rot = B * J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For vibration, the energy levels are E_vib = (1/2) h w + h w (v), where v is the vibrational quantum number, starting at 0. So the spacing between vibrational levels is h w, which is the same for each step. For rotation, the spacing between levels depends on J, so it's more variable. 

Wait, but in the rigid rotor model, the spacing between adjacent rotational levels increases as J increases. But the vibrational transitions are much higher in energy because w is typically in the range of 1e13 to 1e14 rad/s for infrared, while rotational transitions are in the microwave, so lower frequency. So if the photon is to cause a transition, is the problem considering vibrational or rotational? The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, so perhaps the lowest energy transition is the rotational one.

But wait, the question is about the next state, so maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state and the ground rotational state. The next state could be the first excited rotational state or the first excited vibrational state. Which
