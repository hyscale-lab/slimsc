Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup: There's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. So mu = γ S_z, right? And initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after this change.

Hmm. So the particle's spin is initially aligned with the magnetic field along Z. Then, the field switches to Y. I remember that when the field changes direction, the spin will precess around the new field direction. But how does this affect the expectation value of S_z?

Wait, the problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So we're looking for the frequency of these oscillations. I think this is related to the Larmor frequency, but I'm not entirely sure how the change in field direction affects it.

Let me recall: The energy levels of a spin in a magnetic field are given by the Zeeman effect. The energy is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So the Hamiltonian is H = -mu·B. Since mu is γ S_z initially, when B is along Z, H becomes proportional to S_z.

But when the field changes to Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The new Hamiltonian would involve S_y, right? So H = -γ B S_y. Wait, because mu is γ S_z, but if the field is along Y, then mu·B becomes γ (S · B), but since B is along Y, it's γ B S_y.

So, the system's Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -γ B S_y. But wait, the magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z, so the new Hamiltonian is H = -mu · B_new. Since B_new is along Y, that's H = -γ B S_y. So H = -γ B S_y.

Wait, but S_y is an operator, and the state of the system initially is an eigenstate of S_z. Let's think about the initial state. Before the field is switched, the particle is in an eigenstate of S
