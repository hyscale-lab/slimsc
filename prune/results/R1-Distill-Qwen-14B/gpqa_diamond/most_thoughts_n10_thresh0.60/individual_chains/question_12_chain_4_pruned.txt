Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A to D.

Wait, so in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. That means the momenta of the decay products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So the muon and neutrino will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass. I think for the purpose of these problems, sometimes the neutrino's mass is considered negligible. Oh wait, but in the rest frame, the neutrino would have some energy and momentum, but if its mass is negligible, maybe we can treat it like a photon in terms of energy and momentum relation, which is E = |p|c.

Wait, but in the pion's rest frame, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The total energy should equal the rest mass energy of the pion because initially, the pion is at rest, so its energy is just m_pi c².

So the equation for energy is: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

And for momentum, since they must cancel each other, the magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But the muon has a rest mass, so its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). For the neutrino, since m_nu is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu c.

So let me set p_mu = p_nu = p. Then,

E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) / c²? Wait, maybe I should write energies in terms of MeV and momentum in terms of MeV/c.

Wait, let's think in units where c=
