Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about matrices and their properties. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement is correct. Let me think through each option step by step.

First, let's look at the matrices given:

W is a 3x3 matrix:
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0

X is:
i  -1  2i
1   0   1
2i -1  -i

Y is:
0.5 0.1 0.2
0.1 0.25 0.1
0.2 0.1 0.25

Z is:
3       2i      5
-2i    -2     -4i
5       4i      4

The options are A to D, each making a statement about these matrices. I'll go one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Wait, e^X here is the matrix exponential of X. I remember that for a matrix to be unitary, its exponential (if the matrix is skew-Hermitian) would be unitary. Because the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix is unitary, and unitary matrices preserve the norm of vectors. So if X is skew-Hermitian, then e^X would be unitary, and multiplying any vector by it wouldn't change the norm.

But wait, is X skew-Hermitian? Let me check. A skew-Hermitian matrix satisfies X† = -X, where † denotes the conjugate transpose.

So let's compute X's conjugate transpose. The original X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

The conjugate of each element:

Row 1: -i, -1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Then, transpose the matrix (swap rows and columns):

First row becomes [i, -1, 2i] → Transposed would be:
First column: i, 1, 2i
Second column: -1, 0, -1
Third column: 2i, 1, -i

Wait, no, the transpose of X, which is X^T, would have rows as the original columns and vice versa.

Wait, maybe better to write X and X†.

X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

X† is the conjugate transpose: columns become rows, and each element is conjugated.

So X† would be:

Row 1: i*, 1*, 2i* → -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: (-1)*, 0*, (-1)* → -1,
