Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because sigmatropic rearrangements aren't my strongest topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out what the products are for each. Then match them to the options A, B, C, D. Let's take it one at a time.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Hmm, so the reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The conditions are H+ and heat. Oh wait, sigmatropic rearrangements are pericyclic reactions where a pi bond moves into a sigma bond. Cope and Claisen are examples, so this might be a similar kind of rearrangement.

Wait, but the question says it's a sigma-tropic rearrangement. Sigma bonds moving... Oh, sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. Like, maybe a [3,3] shift or something else.

Looking at the first reactant: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw that structure. It's an ethanamine where both CH2 groups are replaced by OMe groups on the nitrogen. So, the structure is (CH3O)2NCH2CH2? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. If it's 1,1-dimethoxy, then the amine group is attached to two methoxy groups. So, it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? Oh wait, wait, the formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So, the ethanamine is CH2CH2NH2, but the amine is substituted with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So, the structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH? No, wait. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. The 1 position is the first carbon, so the two methoxy groups would be on the ethyl group at the 1-position. So, the structure is H2
