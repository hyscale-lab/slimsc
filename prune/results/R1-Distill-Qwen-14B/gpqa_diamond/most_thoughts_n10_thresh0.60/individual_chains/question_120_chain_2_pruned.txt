Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, which probably means that their distribution in space is uniform, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects the parallax.

First, I remember that parallax (p) is related to the distance (d) of a star. The formula is p = 1/d, where p is in parsecs and d is in parsecs. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, parallax is the reciprocal of distance. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. For example, a star at 2 parsecs has a parallax of 0.5 arcseconds.

Now the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. Let's say I have a range of parallax from p to p + dp. How many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So the number of stars should depend on the volume of space that corresponds to a given parallax range.

Wait, but how does the parallax range translate to distance? Because parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a small change in parallax corresponds to a larger change in distance when p is small (since distance is large). 

Let me think about the relationship between distance and parallax. Parallax p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So as p increases, d decreases. The differential relationship would be dd = -1/p² dp. But since we're interested in a range, maybe I don't need to worry about the sign. So the change in distance for a change in parallax is proportional to 1/p².

But wait, I'm trying to find the number of stars in a given parallax interval. So, for a given range in p (say, from p to p+dp), the corresponding distance range is from d = 1/p to d + dd = 1/(p + dp) ≈ 1/p - dp/(p²) because derivative of 1/p is -1/p².

But maybe it's better to think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a spherical shell of radius r and thickness dr is 4πr² dr multiplied by the number density (n), assuming uniform distribution. So the number of stars N is proportional to r² dr.

Since r
