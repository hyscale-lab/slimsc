Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about a reaction involving ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene reacting with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The researcher checked the reaction using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots formed. I need to figure out which options (A-D) are the possible products.

First, I should draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Breaking that down: the main group is a benzene ring with an ether oxygen attached. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is a butenyl group. Butenyl means four carbons with a double bond. The double bond is between C3 and C4 because it's but-3-en-1-yl. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, butenyl has four carbons. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would actually be CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, butenyl is four carbons. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait that's but-1-en-4-yl? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering.

Wait, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the first carbon is the point of attachment. So the structure is: CH2-CH(-something)-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, butenyl would have a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be
