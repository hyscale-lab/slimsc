Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the state of a system and measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. The state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's normalized already? Or perhaps I need to normalize it first.

The operator P is given by a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second row [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third row [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. And Q's operator matrix is diagonal: [1,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,-1]. So Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, okay, so the process is: measure P, get 0, then measure Q, get -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So when you measure P first, you get some eigenvalue, say p, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector of P. Then, measuring Q on this new state gives another eigenvalue.

But wait, the state given is a specific vector. So I need to
