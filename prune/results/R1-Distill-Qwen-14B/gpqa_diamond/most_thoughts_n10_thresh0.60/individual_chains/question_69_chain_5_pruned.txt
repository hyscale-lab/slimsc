Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question asks about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. So, the lifetime we measure depends on their speed and the Lorentz factor gamma.

Wait, the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by a factor of gamma. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy, right? Because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But since we're working in units where c=1, energy is in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², but I think the units will work out with GeV for energy and mass.

So, the energy here is 27 GeV, and the mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 times 8 is about 27.28. So 27 is just a bit less than 8 times 3.41. So, 27/3.41 is approximately 7.91. Let's be precise: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87, 3.41 * 8 = 27.28. So 27 is 27.28 - 0.28. So 27/3.41 is about 7.91 approximately.

So gamma is around 7.91.

The lab frame lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7 * 8e-16 is 5.6e-15 s, and 0.91 *8e-16 is approximately 7.28e-16 s. Adding them together, 5.6e-15 + 7.28e-16 is 6.328e-15 s. So τ ≈ 6.33e-15 s.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem gives the energy in the Bubble Chamber as 27 GeV. Is that the kinetic energy or the total energy? I think in particle physics, when they say the energy, it's usually the total energy, which includes rest mass. So I think my calculation is correct.

So the lifetime in the lab frame is about 6.33e-15 seconds.

But the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, I think that refers to the detection resolution, like the time resolution needed. Because in particle detectors, you need a certain time resolution to detect the decay products within the lifetime, otherwise, you might not register the decay.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The decay will only be observed if the particles decay within the time it takes for the chamber to detect them. But wait, the Bubble Chamber doesn't directly measure time; it measures the path of the particles. Oh wait, maybe the question is about the distance over which the decay occurs, not the time. Because the decay products will leave a
