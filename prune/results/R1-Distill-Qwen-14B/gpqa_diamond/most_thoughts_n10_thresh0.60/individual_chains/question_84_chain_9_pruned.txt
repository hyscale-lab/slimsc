Okay, so I have this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically involving the matrix exponential function approximation through a fractional approximation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that when solving partial differential equations numerically, especially using finite differences, we often end up with large systems of equations. These can be represented in matrix form, something like M * u = f, where M is a matrix that comes from the discretization of the PDE.

Now, the matrix exponential function comes into play when dealing with the time evolution of the system. For example, in methods like the exponential time differencing, you might approximate the solution using terms involving e^(Δt * L), where L is some linear operator related to the PDE. But solving e^(Δt * L) directly can be computationally expensive, especially for large systems. So approximations are used.

The question mentions a 'fractional approximation.' I'm not exactly sure what that refers to, but perhaps it's a method that approximates the exponential function using a series expansion or some other technique that makes it more manageable computationally.

The key factor for converting a sequential algorithm to a parallel one—so what makes a method parallel? Well, in parallel computing, you want to break the problem into smaller parts that can be solved simultaneously. For matrices, if the operator can be decomposed into independent parts, each part can be handled by a separate processor. This is often achieved by splitting the matrix into blocks or using a method that allows for parallel application of the exponential.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's about ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or produce nonsensical results. I don't think this directly relates to parallelism; it's more about the correctness of the solution over time.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal conditions might complicate the setup, but I'm not sure how they directly tie into parallel algorithms. Maybe they require more complex solvers, but I don't see the link to parallelism.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Hmm, fractional approximations could involve functions with complex exponents. If the roots are complex, perhaps they allow for decomposing the exponential into multiple terms that can be computed in parallel. Like, if the exponential can be expressed as a sum of exponentials with different frequencies, each term could be computed concurrently.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to break down complex rational functions into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be split into a sum of simpler terms, each part might be computed independently, which would allow for parallel processing. So this seems plausible.

Wait, but what's the difference between option C and D? C is about complex roots, and D is about linear partial fractions. Let me think: partial fraction decomposition is a way to represent a function as a sum of simpler fractions, which can be evaluated separately. If the fractional approximation of the matrix exponential can be expressed as a sum of simpler exponentials, each of those could be computed in parallel. 

Alternatively, the presence of complex roots might lead to terms involving sine and cosine functions, which are oscillatory. But how does that tie into parallelism? Maybe it's about the structure of the exponentials themselves. If the approximation has multiple terms with different exponents, you can compute each term's contribution in parallel and then sum them up.

So, the key factor for converting to a parallel algorithm is probably the ability to decompose the matrix exponential into parts that can be handled independently. Partial fractions or terms that allow splitting would enable parallel computation.

Wait, the question is about the key factor. So which option points to that? Option D says linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. So the fractional approximation being decomposed into a sum of terms via partial fractions would allow each term to be computed in parallel. That makes sense. So the correct answer would be D.

Alternatively, if the approximation leads to a situation where you can split the problem into
