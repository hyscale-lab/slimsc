Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, but wait, no, because if the state is an eigenstate of P_x, unless P_x and P_z commute, which they don't, the state isn't an eigenstate of P_z.

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That's important because if the state is expressed in an eigenbasis of another operator, say P_z, then calculating expectation values and uncertainties is easier.

But wait again, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which is in the same Hilbert space but with basis vectors of P_z. So the state is a superposition of P_z eigenstates.

So to find the uncertainty in P_z, ΔP_z, I need to compute the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z, then take the square root.

Mathematically, ΔP_z = sqrt( ⟨Ψ| P_z^2 |Ψ⟩ - ⟨Ψ| P_z |Ψ⟩^2 )

So first, I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z^2⟩.

But wait, since the state is already in the P_z eigenbasis, because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each component of the state corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z.

Wait, let me get this clear. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So each basis vector |n> is an eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue, say, p_z,n.

Given that, the state Ψ is a linear combination of these |n> vectors. So the components of Ψ in this basis are the coefficients, which are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

So each component corresponds
