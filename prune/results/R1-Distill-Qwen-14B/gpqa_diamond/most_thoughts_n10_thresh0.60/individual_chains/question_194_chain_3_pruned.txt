Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is e^{-βE}, where β is 1/(kT). So I need to figure out all the possible states the system can be in and calculate E for each.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them all out. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3.

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute the energy E. The formula is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let me compute each term:

1. State 1: All +1s.
S1S2 = +1*+1=+1
S1S3 = +1*+1=+1
S2S3=+1*+1=+1
Sum = 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. State 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.
Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, wait. Wait. Let me recompute that. Sum is (1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Hmm, okay.

3. State 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2= -1, S1S3=+1, S2S3= -1.
Sum = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1. E = J again.

4. State 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1.
Sum = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. So E=J.

Wait, let me double-check that. S2S3 is (-1)*(-1)=+1. So the sum is (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. Right.

5. State 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.
S1S2= -1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1.
Sum = (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1. E=J.

6. State 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.
S1S2=-1*+1= -1
S1S3=+1 (since -1*-1=+1)
S2S3=+1*-1=-1.
Sum = (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1. So E=J.

Wait, no, wait. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2: (-1)(+1) = -1
S1S3: (-1)(-1) = +1
S2S3: (+1)(-1) = -1
Sum: (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. So E=J.

7. State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.
S1S2: (-1)(-1)=+1
S1S3: (-1)(+1)=-1
S2S3: (-1)(+1)=-1
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E=J.

8. State 8: All -1s.
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum=3. E=-3J.

Wait, so looking at all the states:

States 1 and 8 have E = -3J each.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7: All have
