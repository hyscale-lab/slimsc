Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and their entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which is a measure of disorder. But wait, how do I find the entropy of a supermassive black hole when given its angular size?

The question says the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs, and the angular size θ is 10^-17 degrees. I think the first step is to relate the angular size to the actual size of the event horizon. Oh right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius of the event horizon and d is the distance. But wait, I should make sure about the units here.

Wait, θ is given in degrees. I remember that when θ is small, it can be approximated in radians as θ (radians) ≈ θ (degrees) * (π/180). So let's convert θ to radians.

θ_deg = 1e-17 degrees. Converting to radians: θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, using θ ≈ R/d. Solving for R: R ≈ θ * d.

But wait, d is in parsecs. I need to convert that to meters because I'll need standard SI units for entropy calculation. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So R ≈ θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19 rad) * 3.086e26 m. Let me calculate that.

1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 ≈ 1.745 * 3.086 ≈ about 5.37, and the exponents: 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7. So R ≈ 5.37e7 meters. Wait, but wait, 1.745e-19 times 3.086e26 is (1.745 *3.086) *1e(26-19)= ~5.37 *1e7 meters, so 5.37e7 meters. So R is approximately 5.4e7 meters.

Wait, but event horizon radius of a black hole is given by R = 2GM/c², where M is the mass. And the formula for entropy of a black hole is S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon (A=4π R²).

Alternatively, I've heard that the entropy S is proportional to the area A of the event horizon. So S = (A c³)/(4 ħ G) * (k_B), but I need to get the exact formula.

Wait, let me think. The formula for the entropy of a black hole is S = (k_B c^3 A) / (4 ħ G) ),
