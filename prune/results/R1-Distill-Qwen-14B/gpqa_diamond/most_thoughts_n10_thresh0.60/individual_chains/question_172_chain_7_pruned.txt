Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, right, in stellar atmospheres, under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in a particular energy state is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since they're talking about the same energy levels, the statistical weights g_i and g_j would be the same for the same transition, so g_i/g_j is 1 in this case. 

Wait, but in this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, the excitation here is about the ratio of populations in two energy levels. For star_1, the excitation (n_i) is twice that of star_2 (n_j). So the ratio n_i/n_j is 2 for star_1, and I guess for star_2, it's 1 (since it's the base). Or wait, no, the problem says star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited as star_2's. So if we take the ratio of excitation (n_i) for star_1 over that of star_2 is 2.

Wait, no. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level is higher in star_1.

So, applying the Boltzmann equation for each star. Let me denote:

For star_1:
n1_i / n1_j = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star_2:
n2_i / n2_j = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, n1_i = 2 * n2_i. And I think n1_j and n2_j are the lower states. Wait
