Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because isomerism and tautomerism can get a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me tackle each part separately.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift of electrons, leading to different structures. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, which is common in ketones and aldehydes. But wait, benzoquinone—what's its structure? Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups, right? It's like benzene with two O's, each connected with a double bond. So, it's O=C6H4=O. Because of the conjugated structure, maybe it can undergo some tautomerism. Or wait, maybe it's more about whether the structure allows enol formation.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. So, it's like O=C-(CH2) around the ring in three positions. Now, tautomerism usually requires adjacent double bonds where a hydrogen can move. Do these compounds have the necessary groups?

Benzoquinone: It's a conjugated diketone. I think that in some cases, like in 1,4-benzoquinone, there can be enol tautomerism. Because the two ketone groups are opposite each other, maybe the molecule can lose a water molecule and form an enol form. So that would allow for tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups. Wait, does that mean each adjacent carbon has a carbonyl group? Let me visualize: the ring has three carbonyls at positions 1,3,5. So, each adjacent carbon is a carbonyl. For enol tautomerism, you need a hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl. But in this case, each carbon in the ring is part of a ketone, so perhaps the adjacent carbons (if any) don't have hydrogens available. Wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. So 1,3,5-trione would have three carbonyl groups, so each adjacent carbon is either an oxygen (like in the carbonyl) or another carbonyl. So maybe there are no alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Because in each carbonyl group, the carbons adjacent are all part of other carbonyls, so no H's to shift. If there's no H alpha to the carbonyl, then tautomerism isn't possible.

So which one doesn't show tautomerism? The question says which one does not show it. So if benzoquinone does show tautomerism, and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not, then A would be cyclohexane trione.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Benzoquinone is a diketone, so yes, it can show keto-enol tautomerism. So if we have (A) the compound that does not show tautomerism, that's the trione, because it can't tautomerize. So A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Part B: Which of the compounds shows optical isomerism? The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, compounds with planes of symmetry may not exhibit it.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CH3. Wait, wait, no. Let me think. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Its ester would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: O

Structure: O
          |
CH3-C-O-OCH3, with a hydroxyl group on the central carbon. Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2-COOCH3. No, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, the ester is methyl ester. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but 2-hydroxy would have the OH on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, the acid is propionic acid, so propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, no. Let me correct. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. The 2 position is the middle CH2. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no, because 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait: Is that correct? Let me imagine the structure. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So if the 2nd carbon (the middle CH2) has an OH, the structure becomes CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbon (the CH(OH)) has four different groups: one CH3, one COOCH3, one hydroxyl (OH), and one hydrogen. So yes, it's a chiral center. Thus, this compound can show optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a dihydroxy compound, but the structure is such that it's a substituted maleic acid. Fumarate is the cis isomer, I think. Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is the cis isomer. Its structure is HO2CCH2CH2CO2H (no, wait, no). Wait, maleic acid is the trans-dihydroxy isomer, and fumaric acid is the cis-dihydroxy. Wait no, wait, I get confused. Let me think: Fumaric acid is the cis-dihydroxy form. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, that's not right. Wait, maleic acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, where the two COOH groups are on opposite sides (trans), and fumaric acid is the cis version, so the COOH groups are on the same side.

Wait, no. Wait, I think I'm mixing up. Fumaric acid is actually the cis isomer of maleic acid. So the structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H, but the two COOH groups are on the same side. Now, when it's converted into dimethyl fumarate, it becomes (CH3OOC)2C=CHCH2(COOCH3)2? Wait, no. Let me draw the structure. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in a cis configuration. So when both COOH groups are esterified with methanol, they become (CH3OOC)2C=CHCH2(COOCH3)2? No, wait. No, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH2(COOCH3)2 with a double bond. Wait, no. Let me get this right.

Fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, no. Wait, no, fumaric acid has two COOH groups connected by a double bond. So it's HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's succinic acid. Wait, no. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that's not correct. I think I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maleic acid is the trans-dihydroxy version, and fumaric acid is the cis. So maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the two COOH groups on opposite sides, whereas fumaric acid has them on the same side.

So when you make dimethyl fumarate, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is (CH3OOC)-CH₂-CH₂-(COOCH3)? No, wait, no. Wait, the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH. No, no, because that's succinic acid. No, wait, no. Fumaric acid is actually HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration. So when it's made into dimethyl ester, it becomes CH₂(COOCH3)₂, but with a double bond in between.

Wait, no. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Because the double bond is between the two CH₂ groups. So the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂.

So, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me think. The molecule is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. The two ester groups are on the same carbon (the CH₂ groups adjacent to the double bond). Wait, no. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, no, wait. No, fumarate is the cis di-ester of fumaric acid. So the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the ester of fumaric acid, which is a substituted maleate.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Does dimethyl fumarate have a plane of symmetry?

Fumarate is the cis ester. So the two ester groups are on the same side of the double bond. So the structure would be (CH2(COOCH3)₂) with a double bond. Wait, no. The structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So the molecule is CH₂=CH–C(OOCH3)₂. Hmm, wait, no. No, each of the two carbons attached to the double bond has an ester group. So the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, no. Each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups? No, each of the two carbons in the double bond is attached to an ester group. So the structure is O=C-(COOCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO-OCH3? No, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the CH2 groups adjacent to the double bond has an ester group. Wait, no, actually, each of the two carbons in the double bond has an ester group attached to it.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH2(COOCH3))2C=C. Wait, no, perhaps the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-C(O)OCH3? No, that's the structure of something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3OOC)CH2CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. So it's (CH3OOC)CH₂CH₂(COOCH3) with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. So CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. So the molecule is symmetric across the double bond.

Wait, if the two ester groups are on either end of a double bond, and the molecule is symmetric, then there's a plane of symmetry. So, for example, if the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, then looking along the double bond, perhaps the two sides are mirror images. So, this would make the molecule symmetrical, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents on either side are identical, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry. So in this case, both sides of the double bond have the same ester groups, so the molecule is symmetrical, so it wouldn't have a chiral center, thus no optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I thought fumarate is the cis isomer. So when you have a double bond, if the substituents on each carbon are identical, then the molecule is symmetrical. So for example, if both carbons have the same groups, then the molecule is achiral. So if both carbons have two ester groups each, then the molecule is symmetric. So dimethyl fumarate is symmetric, so it doesn't have any chiral centers and hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what about methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate? Earlier, I thought it has a chiral center, so it would show optical isomerism. So the B part is asking which of the two compounds show optical isomerism. So between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one does.

If dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, then it doesn't show optical isomerism. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center, so it does show optical isomerism. So B would be methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought that dimethyl fumarate is symmetric. So part B would have the answer as methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (because it can show optical isomerism) and dimethyl fumarate can't.

So putting it all together:

A is the compound that doesn't show tautomerism. We concluded that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism because it lacks alpha hydrogens. So A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

B is the compound that shows optical isomerism, which is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says A = cyclohexane-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So option A would be option A) A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → this matches our conclusion.

Option C: A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate → our B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so option C is incorrect.

Option D: A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate → no, because both are incorrect.

Option B: A = benzoquinone (would be the opposite), so no.

Wait, no. Wait the question says:

Among the given compounds (benzoquinone & cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione) the compound that does not show tautomerism (A) and among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which one will show optical isomerism (B).

So the options are:

Option A: A is cyclohexane..., B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → correct.

Option B: A is benzoquinone, B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → A is wrong.

Option C: A is cyclohexane..., B is dimethyl fumarate → B is wrong.

Option D: A is benzoquinone, B is dimethyl fumarate → both wrong.

So the correct option is A) A = cyclohexane..., B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To solve the question, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on tautomerism and optical isomerism.

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism requires the presence of alpha hydrogens (hydrogens adjacent to a carbonyl group) to allow hydrogen and electron shifts. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. It can undergo tautomerism because it has alpha hydrogens available for keto-enol tautomerism.
2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. Due to the arrangement of the carbonyl groups, there are no alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism. Thus, it does not show tautomerism.

Therefore, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center or a lack of internal symmetry.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (CH(OH)) is a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. Therefore, it shows optical isomerism.
2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of this compound is (CH₃OOC)₂C=CH. The molecule is symmetric due to the identical groups on either side of the double bond, resulting in no chiral centers. Thus, it does not show optical isomerism.

Therefore, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer
Combining the results:
- For part A, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**.
- For part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

The correct option is **A**.
