Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hmm, I remember learning a bit about the CMB in my cosmology class. Let me try to think through this.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by this annihilation process. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation producing electron-positron pairs. So the reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e−. I think I remember that high-energy gamma rays can interact with the CMB photons, which are low-energy.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So each CMB photon has about that much energy on average. I suppose the gamma-ray in question must have enough energy to interact with these CMB photons to produce an electron-positron pair.

Wait, but how does this limit the gamma-ray's lifetime? Oh right, this process would cause the gamma-ray to lose energy over time. If the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process, it means that the annihilation happens quickly enough that the gamma can't travel far before it disappears. So the lifetime is inversely related to the annihilation rate.

I think the cross-section for this process is important. The cross-section depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the CMB photon. For pair production via two-photon annihilation, the cross-section increases as the gamma-ray energy increases because higher energy gammas can more easily produce the massive electron-positron pairs.

The formula I recall is for the interaction length or the optical depth, but maybe I need to think about the photon's mean free path. The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the cross-section σ multiplied by the number density n of the target photons.

Wait, the mean free path λ = 1/(nσ). So if the annihilation cross-section is large, the mean free path is small, meaning the photon doesn't travel far before annihilating. So when the gamma-ray's energy is such that the cross-section is high enough that λ is smaller than some characteristic length in the universe, like the size of the observable universe, then the lifetime is limited.

But the problem is asking at what energy E the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. So the lifetime τ is related to the mean free path. Oh right, τ = λ / c, where c is the speed of light.

But how does the cross-section σ depend on the gamma-ray energy? I think the cross-section for γγ → e+e− goes like E^2, but maybe it's a bit more involved. Let me think. For two-photon annihilation, the cross-section σ has a threshold. Each photon must have enough energy so that their combined energy is at least twice the electron mass (since you need to produce a pair). The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so each photon must have energy above half that if they're both low-energy. But in this case, the CMB photon is at 1e-3 eV, which is way lower than 0.511 MeV. So the gamma-ray must have enough energy that when it collides with a CMB photon, the sum is above 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The gamma-ray energy E and the CMB photon energy ε. So E + ε must be at least 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So E must be greater than 1.022 MeV minus ε. But ε is 1e-3 eV, which is negligible compared to 1 MeV. So the threshold is actually about 1.022 MeV. So for E much higher than this, the process can proceed.

But the cross-section σ for this process is probably proportional to E squared? Or maybe E^4? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think the cross-section for this process at high energies scales as σ ~ E^2 (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, I think it's more like σ ∝ E^2/(m_e^2), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the pair production threshold. The process γ + γ → e+ e− is possible when the center-of-mass energy is above 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So for a CMB photon of energy ε and a gamma-ray of energy E, the condition is sqrt( (E + ε)^2 ) >= 2m_e c². Wait, no, more accurately, the invariant s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (p_γ c + p_cmb c)^2. Since the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction, their momenta are opposite. So s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (|p_γ| c - |p_cmb| c)^2. Since E = |p| c for photons.

So s = (E_γ + E_cmb)^2 - (E_γ - E_cmb)^2 = [ (E_γ + E_cmb + E_γ - E_cmb) (E_γ + E_cmb - E_γ + E_cmb) ) ] = (2 E_γ)(2 E_cmb) ) = 4 E_γ E_cmb.

Wait, that's interesting. So the invariant s is 4 E_γ E_cmb. For the process to happen, s must be ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. So,

4 E_γ E_cmb ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2 → E_γ ≥ ( (2 m_e c²)^2 ) / (4 E_cmb ) ) → E_γ ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / E_cmb.

So E_γ ≥ (0.511 MeV)^2 / E_cmb.

Given that E_cmb is 1e-3 eV. Let me compute that.

E_γ (in eV) is (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) → (0.511^2 * 1e12) eV^2 / 1e-3 eV → (0.261 * 1e12) eV → 2.61e11 eV.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.61e11 eV is 261 GeV.

Wait, but the options are way higher than that. The options are in the 1e5 to 3e5 GeV range. Wait, 2.61e11 eV is 261 GeV, which is 0.261e3 GeV. But none of the options are that low. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's recheck.

Wait, (0.511 MeV)^2 is (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 eV². Divided by E_cmb which is 1e-3 eV.

So (0.261e12 eV²) / (1e-3 eV) )= 0.261e15 eV. Which is 2.61e14 eV. Wait, no, wait. 0.261e12 (eV²) divided by 1e-3 eV is 0.261e15 eV. 0.261e15 eV is 2.61e14 eV. Wait, but 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, so 2.61e14 eV is 261e5 GeV. Wait, 2.61e14 eV = 2.61e14 / 1e9 GeV = 2.61e5 GeV. Oh, that's 2.61e5 GeV, which is option C (2.6*1e5 GeV). So that's the answer.

So the gamma-ray energy must be at least about 2.6e5 GeV for the cross-section to be significant enough that the annihilation process limits its
