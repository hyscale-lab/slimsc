Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. But wait, a synchrocyclotron is a special type—like, maybe it's just a variation, maybe it can handle relativistic particles or something? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy (so T≈0) and undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or does it mean it goes through two acceleration processes? Or maybe it's about the number of times it's accelerated? Not entirely sure yet.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Oh, right, in a cyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is adjusted to match the particle's cyclotron frequency as it gains energy. But wait, in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but as the particle gains mass (relativistic effects), the frequency changes. Synchrocyclotrons might account for that, hence the ν(α) which probably depends on the particle's energy.

The data given are Φ0 = π/4 and U0=190 kV. So the initial phase is 45 degrees, and the peak voltage is 190kV.

The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. Hmm, revolutions
