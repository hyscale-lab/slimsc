Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed when the potential energy is zero, which is at the equilibrium point. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are different. 

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx². But wait, in relativistic mechanics, the energy isn't just kinetic plus potential; it's the total energy which includes relativistic effects.

I think the energy of the oscillator should be the sum of kinetic and potential, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. Kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc², and potential is (1/2)kA² because at maximum displacement, all energy is potential. Wait, no, wait. At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. Hmm, but wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy and kinetic energy oscillate. Oh, but when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum.

So the total energy E should be (1/2)kA², right? Because when x is maximum, the potential is (1/2)kA² and kinetic is zero. So E = (1/2)kA². But in relativistic mechanics, at x=0, the velocity is maximum, and the kinetic energy is E = gamma mc² - mc², because gamma is when v is maximum. 

Wait, let me think again. So when the oscillator is at x=0, the velocity is maximum. At that point, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So E = (gamma) mc², since kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². But wait, the total energy E should also be equal to the potential energy maximum plus kinetic energy maximum. Or maybe E is the same at all points, so when x=A, E = (1/2)kA². So setting these equal: (gamma) mc² = (1/2)kA
