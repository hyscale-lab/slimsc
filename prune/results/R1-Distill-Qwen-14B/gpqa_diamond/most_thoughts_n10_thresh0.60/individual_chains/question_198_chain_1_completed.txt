Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about the percentage of a specific cobalt complex in solution. The setup involves Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) in solution. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, stability constants. I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So if β4 is 16, that's the stability constant for the Co(SCN)_4^2- complex, right? Because β usually corresponds to the formation of the nth complex. So β1 is for CoSCN+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2-, β3 for Co(SCN)_3^3-, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^2-.

Wait, actually, I should clarify the order. Sometimes, the numbering starts with the first complex. So β1 is the first complex, which is [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^{4+} or maybe [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}? Hmm, wait, Co(II) complexes. Let me think: Co²+ with SCN- would form complexes where the charge would be (charge of Co) plus n*(charge of SCN). SCN- is -1 each. So, for each n, the charge would be 2+ - n. So the first complex, n=1, would be [CoSCN]^+, charge 2+ -1 = +1. For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, because 2+ -2=0. For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But the problem mentions the 'blue dithiocyanato' complex. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups, so that's the n=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}? Or wait, no, dithiocyanato is two, right? So the blue color is perhaps the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex, which is n=2. Or wait, wait, is that the case? I think the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, but I'm not so sure. Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}? I'm a bit confused about that. The question says 'blue dithiocyanato', which is two SCN- groups. So [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would be the dithiocyanato complex. But wait, I'm not certain. Let me think again.

Wait, I remember that the different Co(SCN)_n complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is blue, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is green, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is brown, and [CoSCN]^+ is red. Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} that's blue. Hmm, I think I might have that mixed up. Or perhaps the blue is for the tetraaquo or something else. Well, the question specifies the blue dithiocyanato. Wait, wait, no, dithiocyanato would be two SCN. So [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is neutral. Hmm, but I'm not 100% sure. Wait, I think the problem says "dithiocyanato", which is two, so n=2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is a neutral complex. But I'm a bit shaky on that, but I'll proceed with that assumption.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's think about the stability constants. The β values are for each step of complexation. So the formation constants are for the stepwise formation. So the overall β for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} is the product of the β's up to n.

Wait, no, actually, the nth stability constant βn is the cumulative constant for the formation of the nth complex. So, the first complex is [CoSCN]^+, β1=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β2=40. The third is [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, β3=63. The fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, β4=16.

Wait, but wait a minute, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That's a bit confusing. Because typically, each successive β would be higher if the complex is more stable. But in this case, β4 is lower than β3. So perhaps the fourth complex is less stable than the third. Hmm, interesting.

So, the total concentration of all Co species is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. But in solution, the Co exists as free Co²+, and as various complexes. The SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is quite high.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} complex, but wait, earlier I thought dithiocyanato is two SCN groups, which would be n=2, so the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is neutral. So that's the dithiocyanato.

Wait no, wait. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, but wait, that would have a charge of 2+ (from Co²+) minus 2 (from two SCN-), so 0. So the complex is neutral. So that's the n=2 complex.

But wait, the problem says 'dithiocyanato' and 'blue'—so which complex is it? I think the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is the tetraaqua? Or perhaps not. Wait, I think [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} is actually blue, while the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is another color, like maybe brown or something else. Hmm, but the question specifically mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, dithiocyanato is two SCN, but if the blue complex is the tetraaqua (n=4?), that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should double-check.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms. Dithiocyanato (di = two) would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} would be a +2 charge. Wait, but the Co²+ and two SCN- would sum to 2+ - 2*(-1) = 0. So it's neutral. Hmm.

But back to the problem. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. So perhaps the blue refers to the tetraaqua, but that would be [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which would be a tetraaqua complex. But then that's four SCN- groups. So perhaps the blue is the tetraaqua complex, which is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, but that's four SCN- groups, so that's the fourth complex. But the question says dithiocyanato, which is two, so maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem says 'dithiocyanato' which is two SCN groups, so n=2. So the complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is the second complex, with β2=40. So to find the fraction of that complex, I need to calculate the distribution of all the Co species.

So the total Co is present as Co²+ and the various complexes. So the species are: Co²+, [CoSCN]^+ (n=1), [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2), [Co(SCN)_3]^- (n=3), [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} (n=4).

The concentrations of each species depend on the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN-. The higher the βn, the more the complex will form. But since the βn values vary, the distribution isn't straightforward.

The approach to find the percentage of the desired complex is to calculate the fraction of each species, then sum them up and find the percentage for the desired one.

The general approach is to use the stability constants and the reaction quotient to determine the distribution.

The formation of each complex is a stepwise process, but when dealing with the distribution, it's easier to consider the overall formation constants. However, each step has its own β. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, actually, each βn is the stepwise formation constant. So the overall constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 through βn. So for example, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is β_total = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But wait, that's not correct. The stepwise constants are for each successive addition. So the total formation constant for the nth complex is the product of all β's up to n.

So for the second complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, the overall β would be β1 * β2 = 9 * 40 = 360.

Similarly, for the third complex, β_total = 9*40*63= 22680, and for the fourth, 9*40*63*16= 362880. Wait, that can't be right because β4 is lower than β3. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing stepwise and overall constants.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4, which are the stepwise formation constants. So the formation of each additional SCN- is governed by each β. So the overall constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn.

Therefore, the concentrations of the complexes can be determined using these overall constants.

So the general expression for the nth complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} = [Co²+] * [SCN-]^n / (β1 * β2 * ... * βn)

Wait, no, I think the correct expression is the formation equation:

Co²+ + n SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}

The equilibrium expression for this is:

β_total = [ [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ] / ( [Co²+] [SCN-]^n )

So β_total = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, no, that can't be right because each β is for adding one SCN at a time. Alternatively, each βn is the stepwise constant for adding the nth SCN-.

So the first complex, [CoSCN]^+:

Co²+ + SCN- ↔ [CoSCN]^+ → β1 = 9.

The second step:

[CoSCN]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2 = 40.

The third step:

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3 = 63.

The fourth step:

[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → β4 = 16.

So the overall β for each complex is β1 for n=1, β1*β2 for n=2, β1*β2*β3 for n=3, and β1*β2*β3*β4 for n=4.

Wait, but β4 is lower than β3. That might mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So perhaps the third complex is the most stable, and the fourth is less so.

But in any case, I need to find the concentration of each species and sum them up.

The total cobalt concentration c_total is the sum of all species:

c_total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But the problem is that without knowing the exact fractions, it's hard to compute. So perhaps we can model the distribution using the stability constants and the concentration of SCN-.

The concept here is the same as the formation of metal-ligand complexes, and it's often modeled using the distribution equations.

The fraction f_n of each complex can be approximated using the formula:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN-]^4 )

Wait, but that's only when the ligand is in excess, which is the case here since [SCN-] is 0.1 M, and the Co concentration is 1e-2 M. So the solution is SCN- rich, which suggests that the complexes will form as much as possible, limited by the stability constants.

Alternatively, the approach is to compute the cumulative formation constants and use the given [SCN-] to find the fraction of each complex.

Another approach is to consider that the concentration of each complex is proportional to the product of the stepwise β's up to that point multiplied by [SCN-]^n.

So the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN-]^n ) / (sum over all m ≤4 of (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN-]^m) )

So for each complex, compute this term and sum them all, then the fraction is the term for the desired complex divided by the sum.

So let's compute each term for m=0 (free Co²+), m=1, m=2, m=3, m=4. Wait, but m=0 would be [Co²+], which has no complexes. So the denominator would be the sum of all the terms for each complex plus the free ion.

Wait, actually, the term for m=0 is 1? Because for the free ion, it's [Co²+] which isn't multiplied by any β or [SCN-]^n. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to model the fractions based on the ligand concentration.

Let me try to proceed step by step.

Compute each term for m=0 to m=4:

For m=0 (free Co²+): term0 = 1 (since no complexes, no β or [SCN-]^n involved)

m=1: term1 = β1 [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

m=2: term2 = β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 = 9 * 40 * (0.1)^2 = 9*40 * 0.01 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6

m=3: term3 = β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 = (9*40=360; 360*63=22680) * 0.001 = 22.68

m=4: term4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN-]^4 = 9 *40 *63 *16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute that:

First, 9 *40 = 360

360 *63 = 22680

22680 *16 = 362880

362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So the terms are:

term0 = 1

term1 = 0.9

term2 = 3.6

term3 = 22.68

term4 = 36.288

Now, sum all these terms to get the denominator.

Sum = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 +36.288 = Let's compute:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 3.6 = 5.5

5.5 +22.68 = 28.18

28.18 +36.288 = 64.468

So the denominator is 64.468.

Now, the fraction for each complex is term_m / sum.

We need the fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the m=2 complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So fraction = term2 / sum = 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05558, or about 5.558%.

But wait, the options are 42.3%, 25.6%, 38.1%, 16.9%. None of these are near 5.5%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the definition of the terms. Because [Co²+] is the free ion, and the complexes are m=1, m=2, etc. So perhaps the term0 is the free ion, and the terms for m=1,2,3,4 are the complexes. But perhaps the way I calculated the terms is not correct.

Wait, another approach: The fraction of each species is given by the product of β's up to m, multiplied by [SCN-]^m, all divided by (1 + sum of all such terms for m=1 to 4).

So the denominator is 1 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, I included term0 as 1, but perhaps that's not correct. Wait, let's think again.

The fraction for each species is:

f_m = (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN-]^m) / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN-]^4 )

So for m=0, f_0 = 1/(sum all terms), which is the free Co²+.

But in the problem, the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is m=2.

So the fraction for m=2 is term2 / sum, where term2 is β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 and sum is 1 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I included term0 (which is 1) and the other terms. So perhaps the denominator is 64.468, but the numerator for m=2 is 3.6. So 3.6 / 64.468 ≈ 0.05558, or about 5.56%.

But the options don't have that. So that suggests I made a mistake in either the approach or the identification of the blue complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the fourth complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is m=4. Let me check that.

In that case, the fraction would be term4 / sum = 36.288 / 64.468 ≈ 0.5628, or 56.28%. But that's also not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong β's. Let me check the β values again.

Wait, the problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each step:

For m=1: β1=9 → term1=9 * 0.1=0.9

m=2: β1*β2= 9*40=360 → term2=360*(0.1)^2=3.6

m=3: β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680 → term3=22680*(0.1)^3=22.68

m=4: β1*β2*β3*β4=22680 *16=362880 → term4=362880*(0.1)^4=36.288

So the denominator is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.

Wait, so if the blue complex is m=4, the fraction is 36.288/64.468≈56.28%, which isn't an option. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the β values in the wrong order. Maybe the β1 corresponds to the fourth complex. But that doesn't make sense because the order is given as β1, β2, β3, β4.

Wait, wait, perhaps the 'stability constants' are given in the order of the complexes. So β1 is the constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So β4 is for the fourth complex, which is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

But in that case, the fraction for the fourth complex is 36.288/64.468≈56.28%, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question isn't about the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex but the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex. But according to the options, the highest fraction is 42.3% (option A). So 56% is not one of the options.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which complex is the blue dithiocyanato. Perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is the tetraaqua, which has four SCN groups. So dithiocyanato would be two, but that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the terms correct but the calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate the terms.

Let me recompute each term:

term1 = β1 * [SCN-] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

term2 = β1*β2 * [SCN-]^2 = 9*40 * 0.01 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6.

term3 = β1*β2*β3 * [SCN-]^3 = 9*40*63 * 0.001 = 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

term4 = β1*β2*β3*β4 * [SCN-]^4 = 9*40*63*16 * 0.0001 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Denominator = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's compute this again.

1 +0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the fractions are:

f0 = 1/64.468 ≈0.0155 → 1.55%

f1=0.9/64.468≈0.014 →1.4%

f2=3.6/64.468≈0.0556 →5.56%

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.352 →35.2%

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5628 →56.28%

So the largest fraction is f4, 56.28%, which isn't an option.

But the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, none of these match. So perhaps my initial assumption about which complex is the blue one is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is the third one, [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, which is m=3. Then, the fraction is f3=22.68/64.468≈35.2%, which is close to option B (25.6%) or C (38.1%). Not exactly, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato implies two SCN ligands. So the complex should be m=2. But according to the calculations, f2 is only 5.56%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the second one, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, but that's dithiocyanato. So the fraction is 5.56%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is not about the dithiocyanato complex but the tetraaqua.

Wait, perhaps the 'dithiocyanato' refers to the fourth complex, but that doesn't make sense because di means two. So I'm back to square one.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the term calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is 0.1. So [SCN-]^4 is 0.1^4 = 0.0001. So term4 is 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are being used inversely. Maybe the stability constants are for the reverse reaction? Unlikely, because stability constants are for formation.

Hmm, another approach. Perhaps the problem is intended to use only the given β for the dithiocyanato complex. So, for the dithiocyanato complex (m=2), the fraction is given by (β1 β2 [SCN-]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN-]^4 )

Which gives us 3.6 / 64.468 ≈5.56%. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato (two SCN) complexes, including both m=2 and m=3 and m=4? But that wouldn't make sense with the term 'dithiocyanato'.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering all species except the free ion. But that's not what the question states.

Wait, maybe I should think that the dithiocyanato complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}, which is m=2, and the fraction is 5.56%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of terms.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the 'stability constants' are given as log β. Because sometimes stability constants are given as log values. But the problem states 'stability constants', which are usually in terms of concentration terms, not log. If they were log, I'd have to take 10 to the power of those numbers, which would make the terms much larger. But the problem says β1=9, which is a small number for a stability constant, so probably not log.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given for the overall complex, not for each step. So, for example, β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. But that would complicate the calculation, as the formation would involve adding each SCN step.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the formation using the cumulative β values, treating each step as a separate complex.

Let me think about it again. The overall approach is to find the fraction of each species, then sum them to get all Co species, and find the percentage for the desired one.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be the sum of all species, including the free Co²+. So the denominator is sum_terms = term0 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4.

But earlier, I included term0 as 1, which is correct because [Co²+] = c_total * f0, where f0 = term0 / sum_terms.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is sum_terms = 1 + term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 = 64.468.

So, the fraction for each species is term_m / sum_terms.

So, for m=2, term2=3.6 → fraction 3.6/64.468 = 5.56%.

But the options don't include this, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the total Co concentration is the sum of all species, which is 1e-2 M. So the actual concentrations are calculated based on the fractions.

Wait, another approach: the molar fractions are given by the terms, but the actual concentrations would involve these fractions multiplied by the total cobalt concentration.

But in our case, the fractions are already calculated based on the relative terms, so the percentages should be correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, but that would include m=2, m=3, m=4, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex, which is m=4. But as calculated, its fraction is about 56.28%, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the β4 is given for the third complex? Or perhaps I mixed up the order.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait a minute! β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). That suggests that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So perhaps the third complex is the most stable, and the fourth isn't formed much. So perhaps the major species is m=3.

In that case, the fraction for m=3 is 22.68/64.468 ≈0.352, or 35.2%, which is near option C (38.1%) but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recompute the denominator:

term0:1

term1:9 *0.1=0.9

term2:9*40*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6

term3:9*40*63*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

term4:9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 → +3.6=5.5 → +22.68=28.18 → +36.288=64.468.

Fraction for m=3 is 22.68 /64.468 = approximately 0.352, or 35.2%.

That's close to option C (38.1%), but not exactly. So perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_3]^- or some other complex. Or perhaps the 'dithiocyanato' refers to [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, but that's four SCN, which would be tetraaqua.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to consider only the first two complexes, but that doesn't fit the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the first two complexes, but I don't see how that would lead to the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of all terms is not 64.468 but something else. Let me recheck the calculations.

term1:9 *0.1=0.9 → correct.

term2:9*40=360 *0.01=3.6 → correct.

term3:360 *63=22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

term4:22680 *16=362880 *0.0001=36.288 → correct.

Sum terms: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468 → correct.

Hmm. So the fractions are as calculated. So perhaps the problem assumes that the blue dithiocyanato complex is m=3, but that would be trithiocyanato. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different complex. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of the complex.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is m=4, but with β4=16, which is lower than β3=63, so the fourth complex isn't as favored. So the fraction of m=4 is 36.288/64.468≈56.28%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the term 'dithiocyanato' to refer to the fourth complex. But that doesn't make sense. Dithiocyanato is two, so m=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the sum of all complexes beyond the first, but that would include all except free Co²+.

No, the question is specific about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato complexes.

Hmm, perhaps I should re-express the fractions in terms of the options given. Let's compute all fractions again.

f0:1/64.468 ≈0.0155 →1.55%

f1:0.9/64.468≈0.014 →1.4%

f2:3.6/64.468≈5.56%

f3:22.68/64.468≈35.18%

f4:36.288/64.468≈56.28%

So the only option close to any of these is option C (38.1%) for f3, but 35.18% isn't exactly that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the terms.

Wait, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, so [SCN-]^3 is 0.001, and [SCN-]^4 is 0.0001. So term3 is 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = 22680 * 0.001=22.68. Correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the conditional formation constant, Kf', which accounts for the free ligand concentration. The conditional constant is Kf' = β * [SCN-].

Wait, but the conditional formation constant is used when the ligand is in large excess, which is the case here since [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the concentration of Co.

In that case, the conditional constant for each complex is Kf' = β * [SCN-]^n, where n is the number of ligands.

But in this case, the approach I've taken already includes [SCN-]^n in the terms.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. The fraction of each complex can be found using the formula:

fn = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN-]^4 )

Which is what I did earlier.

So according to that, the fractions are as before.

But none of the options match, so perhaps the problem is intended to calculate the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (m=2) as 3.6/64.468=5.56%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which includes m=2, m=3, and m=4. So the sum would be (3.6 +22.68 +36.288)/64.468 → (62.568)/64.468≈0.9706, or 97.06%. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the first and second complexes.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo and the blue complex is the third one. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the 'dithiocyanato' complex is m=4. Wait, di means two, so that would be m=2. So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the fraction is 5.56% and see if any option matches, but none do.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms. Let me recompute.

term1: 9 *0.1=0.9 → correct.

term2: 9*40=360 * (0.1)^2=0.01 → 360 *0.01=3.6 → correct.

term3:9*40=360 *63=22680 → 22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

term4:9*40=360 *63=22680 *16=362880 → 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288 → correct.

So calculations are correct.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering only the first three complexes, omitting the fourth. Let's see what the fractions would be in that case.

The sum would be 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 = 28.18.

Then, f2=3.6/28.18≈0.1277 →12.77%.

Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering only the first complex.

But that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the molar concentrations without considering the charges, which might affect activity coefficients. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the logarithmic form of the stability constants. Let me check what happens if I take β as log values.

If β1=9 is log β1=9, then the actual β would be 1e9, which is extremely high, leading to the complexes being almost completely formed. But that's not the case here, as the given β's are small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the stability constant. Taking 1/β. But that would make the complexes less stable, which doesn't fit with the given β's.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are for the reverse reactions, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, I'm stuck. According to my calculations, the percentage for the dithiocyanato (m=2) complex is about 5.56%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. So the Co is 0.01 M, and SCN is 0.1 M.

Wait, but what if the solution is not in excess of SCN-? So, perhaps the ligand isn't in large excess, and the assumption that [SCN-] is approximately constant isn't valid. In that case, the calculation would need to account for the consumption of SCN- as it forms complexes.

But considering that [SCN-] is 0.1 M and Co is 0.01 M, and each complex consumes up to four SCN- ions, the total SCN- consumed would be up to 4 * 0.01 = 0.04 M. So 0.1 -0.04 =0.06 M SCN- remains. But this complicates the calculations, and I think the problem expects us to assume that [SCN-] is approximately constant.

So, given that, I think my initial approach is correct, but none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the denominator. Let me recompute the sum:

term0=1

term1=0.9

term2=3.6

term3=22.68

term4=36.288

Sum: 1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468 → correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem expects an alternative approach. Let me think: perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex considering only the first two complexes.

So, sum of m=0 and m=1 would be 1+0.9=1.9.

But then the fraction for m=2 would be 3.6/1.9=1.9, which is more than 1, which isn't possible. So that approach is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the complexes beyond a certain point are negligible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is m=4, giving 56.28%, but that's not an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, 36.288 is the term4. 36.288 /64.468 is about 56.28%. So none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use only the first two complexes, but that would give a sum denominator of 1+0.9+3.6=5.5, and f2=3.6/5.5=0.6545, or 65.45%, which isn't an option either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the β calculation. Let me recheck the β for m=2.

β1 for m=1 is 9.

β2 for m=2 is 40.

So the overall β for m=2 is β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

So the term for m=2 is 360 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6 → correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the m=3 complex, which has a fraction of 35.2%, close to option C (38.1%). So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But why would the blue complex be m=3, which is trithiocyanato? Because blue is traditionally associated with the tetraaqua complex, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, which is m=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's answer is option C, 38.1%, but according to my calculation, it's 35.2%, which is close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me compute 22.68/64.468.

22.68 divided by 64.468.

Let me compute that:

64.468 × 0.35 = 22.5638 → 0.35 → 22.5638, which is close to 22.68. So 0.35 → 35%, which is f3.

So 22.68/64.468 is approximately 0.3518, which is 35.18%, which is close to 35.2%.

But the option C is 38.1%, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers only the first three complexes, and calculates the percentage for m=3 as 22.68/(1+0.9+3.6+22.68) = 22.68/(28.18)=0.352 →35.2%.

But 35.2% isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex has a lower stability, so its percentage is lower than that of the m=3 complex.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of log β values, but that would make the formation constants much larger, leading to more complex formation.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose the β values are in log form. So β1=9 → β=1e9, which is extremely large. Then the terms would be:

term1=1e9 *0.1=1e8.

term2=1e9 *40 *0.01=4e8.

term3=1e9 *40 *63 *0.001=2.52e9.

term4=1e9 *40 *63 *16 *0.0001=3.84e8.

Sum would be dominated by term3, so fraction for m=3 would be 2.52e9/(2.52e9 + ... ) → almost 100%, which doesn't fit the options.

So that approach is unlikely.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is option C (38.1%), but according to my calculation, it's 35.2%, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the β4 value. The β4 is given as 16, which is lower than β3=63, meaning that the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So the third complex would be the major one.

So, the fraction for the third complex is 35.2%, which is the closest to option C (38.1%). But perhaps I made a miscalculation in the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the terms using exact values.

Compute each term:

term0=1.

term1=9*0.1=0.9.

term2=9*40*(0.1)^2=9*40*0.01=3.6.

term3=9*40*63*(0.1)^3=9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*(0.1)^3=22.68.

term4=9*40*63*16*(0.1)^4= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880, 362880*(0.1)^4=36.288.

Sum=1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

So, fraction for m=3 is 22.68/64.468=0.3518 →35.18%.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is option C (38.1%), but according to my calculations, it's approximately 35.2%. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an approximate calculation, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the sum of the terms is not including term0. But that would change the denominator.

Wait, if I exclude term0, the denominator becomes 0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288=63.468.

Then, the fraction for m=3 would be 22.68/63.468≈0.357 →35.7%, still not matching option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's stability constants are given for the complexes beyond the first, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the fraction of the dithiocyanato (m=2) complex as the answer, which is 5.56%, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the first two complexes only, but that would give a sum denominator of 1+0.9+3.6=5.5.

So, the fraction for m=2 is 3.6/5.5≈0.6545 →65.45%, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the fraction of each species as (β1β2...βn [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1β2 [SCN-]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4[SCN-]^4 )

Which is what I did, and according to that, the dithiocyanato (m=2) fraction is 5.56%, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the term 'stability constant' to refer to the formation of the ion pair, which may be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the reverse of the formation reaction.

But I think I've exhausted all possible approaches. Given the options, the closest match to my calculation for m=3 is 35.2%, which is not an option, but option C is 38.1%, which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the terms.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in term3.

Wait, term3= β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 =9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3.

Compute 9 *40= 360.

360 *63= 22680.

22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68 → correct.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D)16.9%, which corresponds to term2 (3.6/64.468≈5.56%) plus something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the problem in a different way. Maybe the question is about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ in solution, considering all possible complexes and the free ion.

But according to my calculations, that's about 5.56%, which isn't an option.

Given that, I'm forced to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the identification of the blue complex.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and the fraction is 35.2%, but the option is C)38.1%, which is close. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term again using more precise numbers.

Compute term3:

9 *40 = 360.

360 *63 = 22680.

22680 * (0.1)^3 =22680 *0.001=22.68.

Yes, correct.

Term4:

9*40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Yes, correct.

Sum: 64.468.

So, no mistake there.

Given that, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex as a part of all possible Co species, which includes the free ion. So, the only way to get an option matching is if the fraction is for m=4, but that gives 56%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the fractions as percentages of the total Co concentration.

Wait, the total Co is 1e-2 M, and the fraction for each species is as calculated. So the actual concentration of each species is (sum_terms) * c_total.

Wait, no, the fractions are already based on the sum_terms, which include all species.

Hmm.

Well, given the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is option C)38.1%, but according to my calculations, it's 35.2%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of term3.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate term3.

9 *40=360.

360 *63 = 22680.

22680 * [SCN-]^3 = 22680 * (0.1)^3 =22680 * 0.001=22.68.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option C)38.1%, but I'm not sure.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and the concentration of thiocyanate ions ([SCN⁻] = 0.1 M). The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the stability constants are provided as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16.

### Key Steps:
1. **Identify the Complexes**:  
   The cobalt species include the free ion (Co²⁺), [CoSCN]⁺ (n=1), [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ (n=2), [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ (n=3), and [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻ (n=4). The blue dithiocyanato complex is assumed to be [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ (n=2), as "dithiocyanato" implies two SCN⁻ ligands.

2. **Cumulative Stability Constants**:  
   The cumulative stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise stability constants up to that complex:
   - For n=1: β₁ = 9  
   - For n=2: β₁β₂ = 9 × 40 = 360  
   - For n=3: β₁β₂β₃ = 9 × 40 × 63 = 22,680  
   - For n=4: β₁β₂β₃β₄ = 9 × 40 × 63 × 16 = 362,880  

3. **Terms for Distribution**:  
   The fraction of each complex is proportional to the product of the cumulative stability constant and [SCN⁻]ⁿ, normalized by the sum of all such terms:
   - Term₀ (free Co²⁺): 1  
   - Term₁ (n=1): β₁[SCN⁻] = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9  
   - Term₂ (n=2): β₁β₂[SCN⁻]² = 360 × (0.1)² = 3.6  
   - Term₃ (n=3): β₁β₂β₃[SCN⁻]³ = 22,680 × (0.1)³ = 22.68  
   - Term₄ (n=4): β₁β₂β₃β₄[SCN⁻]⁴ = 362,880 × (0.1)⁴ = 36.288  

4. **Sum of Terms**:  
   The total sum of terms is:  
   \[
   \text{Sum} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

5. **Fraction of the Blue Dithiocyanato Complex (n=2)**:  
   The fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰ is:  
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\text{Term}_2}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.0556 \, \text{or} \, 5.56\%
   \]

6. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated fraction of the blue dithiocyanato complex (5.56%) does not match any of the provided options (A: 42.3%, B: 25.6%, C: 38.1%, D: 16.9%). However, the fraction of the [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ complex (n=3) is:  
   \[
   f_3 = \frac{\text{Term}_3}{\text{Sum}} = \frac{22.68}{64.468} \approx 0.352 \, \text{or} \, 35.2\%
   \]  
   This value is closest to option C (38.1%).

### Conclusion:
Given the mismatch between the calculated value for the blue dithiocyanato complex and the provided options, and the proximity of 35.2% to 38.1%, the most reasonable choice is **option C (38.1%)**, likely corresponding to the [Co(SCN)₃]⁻ complex instead of [Co(SCN)₂]⁰.

**Answer: C**
