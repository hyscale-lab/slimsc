Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on my spin operators, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think that notation is a spinor. So the spinor is a two-component vector, right? The components are 3i and 4. So the state vector χ should be (3i, 4)^T, I suppose. Or wait, sometimes it's written in column form. Yeah, so χ = [3i; 4].

The expectation value of S_y, which is the spin along the y-direction. Oh right, the expectation value formula is the conjugate transpose of χ multiplied by the operator σ_y multiplied by χ itself. So formula-wise, it's ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| σ_y |χ⟩.

Wait, σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, which the question provides. The matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh, and I remember that the spin operator S is (ħ/2) * σ. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So when calculating the expectation value, it's (ħ/2) times the expectation of σ_y.

So the steps are: first compute the expectation value of σ_y, then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write down the state χ. It's [3i, 4], so the conjugate transpose (bra) would be [ -3 (since i's conjugate is -i), 4 ]? Wait, wait, let me think. The components are 3i and 4. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? But wait, when you take the conjugate of a complex number a + ib, it's a - ib. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so conjugate is 0 -3i, which is -3i. But when you take the transpose for the bra, the order becomes [3i*, 4*], which would be [-3i, 4], but wait, no, wait. No, wait. The vector is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose, χ†
