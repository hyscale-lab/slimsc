Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That's what I remember from my notes. It occurs when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter and isn't a meso compound.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to count how many of them are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Wait, this is an alkene with substituents. The configuration is Z. But does that lead to chirality? I think alkenes with E/Z isomerism don't have a chiral center unless there's a stereogenic center. Let me draw the structure. The molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, actually, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the substituents around the double bond are Cl and CH(CH3) on C1 and on C2, maybe? Wait, no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's but-1-ene: positions 1 and 2 are the double bond. So the substituents on either end are Cl on C1 and CH(CH3) on C2? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe it's Cl on C1, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is Cl-C(=CH2)-CH(CH3). No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would have a double bond from C1 to C2. So the substituents on C1 are Cl and a CH2 group (since butene is four carbons), and on C2, a methyl group and a CH2 group? No, wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=
