Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement is when a 1,5-diene rearranges, right? It's usually a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. But wait, the first part of the question involves BuLi and then H+. Oh right, BuLi is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something?

The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that. So, the benzene ring has a substituent which is a methylene group attached to an oxygen. Wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl. So, the butenyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- attached via an oxygen. Wait, no, wait. Let me parse it correctly. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, no. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. Because but-2-ene is CH2CH2CHCH2 but wait, but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the 1-yl group would be the CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- as the substituent. So the group is O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but wait, no. Wait, the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, no. The 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group: but is four carbons. 2-en means a double bond between C2 and C3. 1-yl is the substituent from C1
