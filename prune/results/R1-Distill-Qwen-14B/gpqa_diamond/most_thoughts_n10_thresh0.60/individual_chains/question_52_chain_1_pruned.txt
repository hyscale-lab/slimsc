Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question is about stars with and without dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I remember that when stars have spots, their overall temperature changes, which should impact the ionization states of elements in their atmosphere. 

Wait, the problem says the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its Teff is 6000K, but when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. So the star is cooler when it has spots. But I'm not sure how that affects the ratio of Ti levels.

The ratio in question is the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When there are spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots), right?

I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the population of energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation. So the ratio of populations is given by (n1/n2) = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The energy levels are in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature drops. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but do they affect the overall photospheric temperature? The problem says the effective temperature decreases to 5500K when 40% is covered. So the overall photosphere is now at a lower temperature on average.

So the ionization state and excitation states of atoms like Ti would change. But the question is about neutral Ti. So if the temperature goes down, the ionization fraction of Ti would decrease, meaning more neutral atoms. But wait, the ratio between two energy levels in neutral Ti is what's being looked at.

Wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio of two energy levels' populations (n1 and n2) is given by:

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) *
