Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. I remember that when stars have spots, it changes their overall temperature, which in turn affects the behavior of the atoms in their photosphere.

So, the star's normal (without spots) effective temperature is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Hmm, I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states at thermal equilibrium (LTE). The equation is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp(-(E_i - E_j)/(k*T)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two specific levels. Let's denote these as level 1 and level 2. Let's say level 1 is lower in energy than level 2, so E1 < E2. Then, the ratio (n1/n2) would be proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), because E2 - E1 is positive. So n1/n2 = exp(ΔE/(k T)), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

But wait, when the temperature changes, this ratio changes. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall T decreases to 5500 K. So, without spots, T is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K.

So the ratio without spots (R1) is exp(ΔE/(k * 6000)), and the ratio with spots (R2) is exp(ΔE/(k * 5500)).

Wait, wait, but the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. Oh, right, because that's the wavelength of the emitted photon when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1. So, the energy difference ΔE corresponds to the energy of a photon with wavelength λ = 1448 Å.

So, the energy ΔE can be calculated using E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. But wait, the wavelength is given in Angstroms. Let me convert that to meters. 1448 Å is 1448e-10 meters, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) = let's calculate that.

Wait, let me compute that step by step
