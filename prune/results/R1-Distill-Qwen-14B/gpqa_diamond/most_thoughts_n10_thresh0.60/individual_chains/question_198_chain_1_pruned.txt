Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and think through what I need to do.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with complex ion equilibria. The stability constants, also known as formation constants, tell us how stable each complex is. The higher the β value, the more stable the complex is.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I remember that in cobalt complexes, different structures can form, and the color depends on the ligands and the structure. The blue color is typically associated with the [Co(SCN)_2] complex, maybe the tetrahedral one? Or is it the octahedral? I might have to look that up, but I think for this problem, it's about the dithiocyanato species, which would be the complex with two SCN- ions.

But wait, the problem says 'dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes.' So that would be Co(SCN)_2^n+? So the species is Co(SCN)_2^2+ perhaps? Or another charge? I'm not exactly sure, but maybe the exact charge doesn't matter for calculating the percentage.

So the main idea is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are the dithiocyanato complexes. The total cobalt comes from the Co²+ ions and all possible complexes they form with thiocyanate.

The stability constants are given as β1 to β4. I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So:

β1 is the constant for [Co(SCN)]^+ (n=1)
β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (n=2)
β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^-
β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2- ?

Wait, but I'm not sure about the charges. Let me think: Co²+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge), the charge would be 2 - n*(1). Because each SCN- contributes a -1, so n SCN- contribute -n. Co²+ is +2, so 2 - n = overall charge.

So for n=1: charge is +1 → [CoSCN]^+
n=2: 0 → neutral complex
n=3: -1 → [Co(SCN)_3]⁻
n=4: -2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, each SCN is -1, so adding n of them is -n. So Co
