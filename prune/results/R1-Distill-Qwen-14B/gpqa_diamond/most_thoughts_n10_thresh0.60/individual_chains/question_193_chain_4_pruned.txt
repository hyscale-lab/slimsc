Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Hmm, right, and the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, specifically per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh yes, the formula is plx = 1 / distance in parsecs. So distance d is 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, then substituting d for plx, since d = 1/plx, we can write N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that: 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but the question is about how N changes with distance r. So does that mean the number increases with distance cubed, fifth power, etc.?

Wait, but wait a second. The question is about the number of stars per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so we need to find the derivative of N with respect to r, perhaps? Because per unit distance, the change in number depends on the rate at which N changes with r.

So let me think: N is proportional to d^5, so N = k * d^5 for some constant k. But when considering the number of stars in a shell between d and d + dr, the number would be proportional to N = k*( (d+dr)^5 - d^5 ). For small dr, this is approximately 5k d^4 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance is dN/dr = 5k d^4.

But wait, the original relation was N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So the number of stars in a region up to distance d is proportional to d^5. But the question is about the number per unit distance, so that's the rate of change, the derivative.

So the number per unit distance (the density of stars, in a way) would be dN/dr, which is 5d^4. So it's proportional to d^4. But wait, the options are in terms of
