Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1 / distance, but wait, the units might complicate things. Oh right, parallax in arcseconds (") and distance in parsecs. So, plx (in ") = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, distance d = 1 / plx.

But wait, the number of stars (N) is inversely proportional to plx^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Let's express N in terms of distance. Since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. Substituting that into N, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) → 1/(1/d^5) = d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I'm thinking about the number density. Like, how many stars are there per parsec or something. So if N is proportional to d^5, what does that imply about the number in a range dr? Like, the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the number of stars per unit distance. So the change in N with d would be dN/dd. Since N ∝ d^5, then dN/dd = 5d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of d?

Wait, but wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5.

But plx is inversely proportional to distance. So let's write plx = 1/d. Then 1/plx^5 = d^5. So N ∝
