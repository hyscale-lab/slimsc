Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says: A charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. We need to find the net potential energy of the system.

I remember that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere induces charges on its surface. But wait, the sphere is grounded, which should affect the induced charges. Oh right, grounding allows charges to flow in or out, so the sphere's overall charge would adjust accordingly.

Wait, the conducting sphere is neutral to begin with because it's grounded. So, when a charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges. Since the charge q is outside, the sphere's inner surface must have an induced charge of -q, right? Because the conducting material allows the charges to move, and the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, which would cause the outer surface to have a charge +q to maintain neutrality. But wait, wait no, because the sphere is grounded. Oh, wait, no, because if the sphere is neutral, the total charge on it must be zero. So the induced charge from the external charge q would be such that the sphere's total remains zero.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of image charges. Because for a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled as an image charge. But I'm not entirely sure about the details here.

Alternatively, I think that when a charge q is placed near a conducting sphere, the
