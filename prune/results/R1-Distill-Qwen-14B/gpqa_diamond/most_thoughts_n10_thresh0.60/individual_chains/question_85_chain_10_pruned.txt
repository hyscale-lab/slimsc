Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors like the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out. So I don't have to worry about albedo affecting the ratio.

The question gives a lot of data, but I think the key pieces are the masses and radii of the planets, and the parameters of the star. Wait, but for equilibrium temperature, I think the main factors are the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh, right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) / ( (1 - albedo)^(1/4) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The equilibrium temperature (Te) is given by:

Te = T_star * ( (R_star) / (2a) )^0.5 * ( (1 - A) )^0.25

But since A is the same for both planets, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of Te1 to Te2 will just depend on the square roots of (R_star/(2a1)) and (R_star/(2a2)), right?

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. The formula is more accurately:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * (
