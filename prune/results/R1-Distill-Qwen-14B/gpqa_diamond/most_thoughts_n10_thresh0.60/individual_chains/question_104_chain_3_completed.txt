Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars have the same mass, each similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. I think the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )) )^(something). But since the planets have masses similar to Neptune, which is much smaller than the stars (which are Sun-like), M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, which is same for both stars. So that term is the same for both planets.

Wait, no, wait. The mass of Neptune is about 17 Earth masses. The Sun is much more massive, so M_planet is much smaller than M_star. So M_planet << M_star, so M_planet can be neglected when considering M_star + M_planet. So for both stars, M_star is same, so that term is same.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude (K) is approximately given by K = ( (G * P)^(1/3) * M_planet sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since the eccentricity e is zero for circular orbits, that term is 1. Also, since both planets have similar masses and same inclination (assuming i is same, since the problem doesn't say otherwise), the difference in K (the velocity shift) must come from the orbital periods and the masses.

Wait, but the problem states that both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_planet for both is same, as they are both Neptune-like. So M_planet is same for both. The stars are same mass, so same M_star. So K should depend on ( (P)^(1/3) ) )^{-1}, because looking at the formula, K is proportional to ( (M_planet) / (M_star)^(2/3) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

So rearranging, K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

But since M_planet and M_star are same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

Wait, so if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So, P ∝ (1/K)^3.

So if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is7 milliangstrom, then the ratio of periods P2/P1 is (K1/K2)^3.

Because P is proportional to (1/K)³, so P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, let me write that again. Let me define K as velocity (m/s), which is proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K = C / P^(1/3), where C is some constant dependent on masses and other factors. So for two planets, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2= C / P2^(1/3). Taking the ratio, K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3). Thus, (K2/K1)^3 = P1/P2.

So P2/P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Wait no, let's re-calculate. Let me take the ratio of K1 and K2.

K1/K2 = (C / P1^(1/3)) / (C / P2^(1/3)) )= P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3) )= (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So solving for P2/P1:

(P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

Wait, because (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3), so cube both sides: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So the period of planet #2 is (5/7)^3 times that of planet #1.

Wait wait, no: because K1 is 5, K2 is7. So K1/K2 =5/7. So (5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1 → P2 = 0.364 * P1 → so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364, so the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 P1, then P2 is shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the correct answer is approximately 0.36, so option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. Since the two stars have the same mass and the two planets have similar masses, the relationship between \( K \) and \( P \) simplifies to \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), or equivalently, \( P \propto \frac{1}{K^3} \).

For Planet #1 and Planet #2, the RV shifts are \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), respectively. The ratio of their orbital periods is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1, meaning it is shorter. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, so the answer is approximately 0.36.
