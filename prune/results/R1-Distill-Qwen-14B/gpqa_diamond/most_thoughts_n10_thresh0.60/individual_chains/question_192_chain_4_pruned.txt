Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think it through step by step.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a smaller spherical cavity of radius r, and the cavity isn't at the center—its center is a distance s away from the conductor's center. So the cavity is kind of shifted. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. Oh, and there's an angle θ between l and s.

Wait, so the point P is outside the conductor, which has radius R. So L is the distance from the conductor's center, which is also the center of the cavity, but the cavity is off-center. So the cavity is somewhere inside the conductor, not concentric.

When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's properties come into play. I remember that in electrostatics, the charges in a conductor rearrange themselves to cancel internal fields. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you put a charge +q in the cavity, the conductor must rearrange its charges to maintain electrostatic equilibrium.

Wait, but the conductor itself was uncharged, so any charges induced should come from redistribution. Oh right, when you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the enclosed charge. But wait, the conductor can't have a net charge because it was initially uncharged. So the inner surface of the conductor (the surface of the cavity) must have -q, and the outer surface would then have +q to balance, since the total conductor is neutral. Wait, no, wait. The conductor was initially neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have an induced -q to cancel the field inside the conductor. Then, since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have +q. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q
