Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about a series of reactions starting with benzene. Hmm, I need to figure out what each step does and what the final product looks like. Let me go through it step by step.

First step: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. Oh right, that's a nitration reaction. Nitration typically happens in a nitrating mixture, which is H2SO4 and HNO3. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. The nitronium ion is the electrophile. Since benzene is symmetric, the nitro group can attach in any position, but in this case, without any substituents, it should go into the meta position? Wait, no, wait. Benzene rings are symmetric, so if it's just benzene without any existing substituents, the nitration would add a nitro group in a certain position. Wait, but actually, nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, which is a meta director. But wait, noâ€”wait, the nitration will add the nitro group in any position because benzene is symmetric. So product 1 is nitrobenzene, right?

Wait, no, wait. Benzene is symmetric, so when it gets nitrated, the product is nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group on a single position. But since the ring is symmetric, the nitro group can be on any carbon, but the structure is the same. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Second step
