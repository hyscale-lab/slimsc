Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I need to figure out what each product is and then determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4.

Let me break down each step.

First step: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine to form product 1. I remember that cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When a ketone reacts with bromine, it might undergo a halogenation. Wait, but where? Oh, right! The alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are the reactive sites. So bromine adds across the double bond formed by the enol. Hmm, or wait, is it a conjugate addition or something else?

Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When you add bromine, it's probably an alpha bromination. So the ketone becomes a dibrominated compound? Or wait, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? No, I think that's when you have water. Wait, no, when you treat ketones with HBr, you get an alpha-brominated ketone. But wait, what's the mechanism here? Oh, right, the base causes deprotonation to form an enolate, which then attacks the electrophilic bromine. So in cyclohexanone, the alpha position is the one adjacent to the carbonyl.

So adding bromine (Br2) in a non-polar solvent like dichloromethane would lead to the formation of a bromoalkane. But wait, wait, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons (each adjacent to the carbonyl). So when Br2 adds, where does it go? It adds to the more substituted position perhaps? Or maybe it's a vicinal dihalide? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. Wait, no, that's with H2O and HBr. Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.

Alternatively, I think that when a ketone is treated with bromine in a basic condition, it leads to the formation of a geminal dibromide. Oh wait, no. Because cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Let me think again. Maybe the bromine adds across the carbonyl group, but that would require the ketone to undergo some kind of addition across the double bond.

Wait, no, cyclohexan
