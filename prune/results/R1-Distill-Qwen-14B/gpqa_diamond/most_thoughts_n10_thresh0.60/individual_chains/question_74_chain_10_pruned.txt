Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out step by step. Alright, let's start by thinking about what I remember about radioactive decay.

So, the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But wait, after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet. Now they're asking, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes? Hmm.

Wait, I think radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, right? The decay constant is involved here. Oh right, the formula I remember is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But wait, how does that relate to the probability of decay?

Oh, right, the probability of decay over a certain time is related to the decay constant. The decay probability P is often given by 1 - e^(-λt). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. The probability that the nucleus hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt), so the probability that it has decayed is 1 minus that.

But wait, the problem gives a 32% probability of decay within 100 minutes. So, that 32% is P(100) = 0.32. So P(100) = 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32.

So I can solve for λ. Let me write that down:

1 - e^(-λ*
