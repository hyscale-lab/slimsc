Okay, so I need to figure out which reaction sequence would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, let's understand the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is bromo, position 5 is nitro, and the ketone is at the 1-position, which is the same as the position where the substituents are attached. Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to benzene. So the substituents are on the benzene ring, which is connected to the ketone.

Wait, structure-wise, the benzene ring is attached to a ketone group (C=O) which is attached to a methyl group (since ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-CH2? No, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-, so the ketone is directly attached to the benzene. So the benzene has a ketone group (as a substituent), and also bromine and nitro groups in the 3 and 5 positions.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The target is
