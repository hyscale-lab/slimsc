Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. Hmm, so the problem says all the apothems are the same length a. When a monochromatic light hits this aperture, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, that probably means we can approximate it as a circular aperture because as N increases, a polygon with many sides looks like a circle.

Wait, but wait. The problem says it's a N-sided polygon and all apothems are length a. So the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the side length and the number of sides. But when N is very large, the polygon is almost a circle with radius a, since the apothem becomes the radius in the limit.

So, when the light passes through this aperture, it's a diffraction problem. The far field pattern is the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minima occur at an angle θ where sinθ = λ/(π a), wait no, wait. Wait, I remember that the first minimum for a single slit is at sinθ = λ/a, but for a circular aperture, it's different. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait no, circular aperture diffraction—the central maximum is surrounded by rings. The first minimum occurs at an angle θ given by something else. Oh right, for a circular aperture, the first dark ring (minimum) occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = 1.22λ/(π a) ? Or is it different? Wait, maybe I should think about the formula.

The formula for the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is given by the zeros of the Bessel function. The first minimum occurs when J1(π a sinθ / λ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at π a sinθ /λ = 1.220. So sinθ = (1.220 λ)/(π a). Wait, but wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, I think the first minimum in the far field for a circular aperture is at θ = 1.22 λ/(a) multiplied by some factor. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For a single slit (which is a rectangular aperture of width a), the first minimum
