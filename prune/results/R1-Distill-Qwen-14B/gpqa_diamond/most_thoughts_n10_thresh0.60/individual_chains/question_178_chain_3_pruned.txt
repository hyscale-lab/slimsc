Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. The sigma matrix is defined as σ_{mu nu} = i/2 [γ_mu, γ_nu]. I remember that γ matrices are dimensionless because they're just constants in the Clifford algebra. So each γ_mu is like a dimensionless object.

I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian term. Since the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action S has dimension [S] = 0, so each term in the integral ∫ d^4x L must have [L] = 4.

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Let's break down L_int: it's κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ, which involves γ matrices, then ψ, and then F^{mu nu}.

Wait, the fermion fields ψ have a specific mass dimension. Fermion fields ψ (like Dirac spinors) have mass dimension 3/2 because the Dirac equation implies that. Because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4, and kinetic terms like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ have to have dimension 4. Let's check: [ψ̄] is the same as [ψ], which is 3/2 each. The derivative ∂_μ has mass dimension 1. So each term: [ψ̄] * [γ] (dimensionless) * [∂_μ] * [ψ] → (3/2) + (1) + (3/2) = 4. So yes, that works.

So back to L_int. Let's compute the dimensions. The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}.

First, σ_{mu nu} is [i/2][γ_mu, γ_nu]. Each γ has dimension 0, so [σ_{mu nu}] = 0.

What about F^{mu nu}? That's the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. The field strength tensor F_{mu nu} has dimensions. Since F is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, and A (the gauge field) has mass dimension 1. Because the kinetic term for A in Maxwell's theory is (∂ A)^2, which must have dimension 4. Each ∂ has dimension 1, so A must be dimension 1. Then F is ∂ A, so F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, but F^{mu nu} is the same as F^{mu nu}, so it's dimension 2.

So putting it all together, each part of the term:

κ: [κ] = ?

ψ̄: [ψ̄] = 3/2.

σ_{mu nu}: [σ] = 0.

ψ: [ψ] = 3/2.

F^{mu nu}: [F] = 2.

So the product is:

[κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = [κ] * (3/2) * (0) ? Wait, no, wait. Wait, σ is part of the term, but the product is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the product is ψ̄ (dimension 3/2) * σ (dimension 0) * ψ (3/2) * F (2). So all together, that's (3/2) + (3/2) + 2 = (3 + 2) = 5. So the product [ψ̄ σ ψ F] is dimension 5.

But the entire term is κ multiplied by this, so [κ] * 5 must be equal to the mass dimension of the Lagrangian, which is 4. Because the Lagrangian term L_int must have dimension 4. So:

[κ] * (3/2 + 3/2 + 2) = [κ] * (3 + 2) = [κ] *5 = 4.

Wait, wait, (3/2 + 3/2) is 3, and +2 is 5. So [κ] *5 =4 → [κ]=4/5? Wait, that can't be right. Because 4/5 is not an integer dimension, but in natural units, dimensions are often integers. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let's clarify each component
