Okay, so I've got this question about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance.

Wait, mean decay distance... Oh right, that's the average distance the particle travels before decaying. I remember that the mean lifetime is related to the width, and from there, you can find the decay length using the particle's velocity and lifetime.

So, first, I think I should find the mean lifetime of the meson. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The formula I recall is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm not sure if I remember the exact relation. Oh wait, no, I think it's Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ.

But wait, when using units, it's important to be careful. Γ is given in MeV, and ħ in natural units is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, no, because 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. Let me check the units. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

Wait, so ħc is a useful constant here. Oh wait, no, for the lifetime, it's ħ divided by Γ. Right, let's think about units. Γ has units of energy, which in SI units is Joules (since 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J). But using natural units where ħ is in units of GeV·s would help.

Alternatively, I remember that the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). Let's compute that. But wait, I should make sure about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. So plugging in Γ in GeV.

So Γ_X is 0.32 GeV (since
