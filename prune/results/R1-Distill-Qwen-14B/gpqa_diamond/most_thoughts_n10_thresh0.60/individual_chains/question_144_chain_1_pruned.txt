Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with various distance values.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = gamma * beta * c * tau, where tau is the mean lifetime. But wait, tau is the lifetime, and I think the width Γ relates to the lifetime through the uncertainty principle. Oh yeah, Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime is inversely proportional to Γ. So tau = ħ / Γ, but I should check the units carefully.

Wait, another thought: the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / tau. So tau = ħ / Γ. But wait, the units might be a bit tricky here. Let me make sure I get the units right.

So, first, I need to calculate the lifetime tau. Then, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Oh wait, the velocity depends on its energy and mass. The meson is produced with energy E_X =8 GeV, and its rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So its kinetic energy is much higher than its rest mass, which means it's moving at a
