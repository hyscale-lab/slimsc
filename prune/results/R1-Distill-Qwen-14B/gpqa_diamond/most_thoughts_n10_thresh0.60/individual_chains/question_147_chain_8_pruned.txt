Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A in a certain reaction. Hmm.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Right, so a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two positively charged A particles and two negatively charged ones. I think A must be some kind of meson, but I'm not entirely sure. But maybe that's not important for solving the problem.

The question states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, wait, that probably means its speed is much less than the speed of light, so maybe we can treat it using non-relativistic mechanics? Or wait, no, because the problem gives m_A c squared as 300 MeV, which makes me think relativistic effects are involved. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let's see.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," which implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So, for the antiproton, we can probably approximate it using non-relativistic terms. But the product particles might be moving at relativistic speeds, so perhaps we need to use conservation of energy and momentum with relativistic equations.

The given data: m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, but protons and antiprotons have rest mass energy around 938 MeV each, right? Because the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². So each proton and antiproton have rest mass energies of about 938 MeV, but the product particles are lighter, at 300 MeV each. Interesting.

Wait, but the question is about the velocity of A. So I need to find the speed of each A particle. Since the reaction produces two A⁺ and two A⁻, the setup is symmetric. So, maybe the momenta of the A particles are going to balance each other in some way.

But let's think about conservation of momentum and energy. Since the initial system is a proton and an antiproton, but wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, but wait, in the initial state, the proton is probably at rest, because it's a target in the lab frame. Or is the setup that the antiproton is moving towards a stationary proton? Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving," so I think that's the case: the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with a low speed, so non-relativistic.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says the antiproton is slow, so we can approximate it as non-relativistic. So, the initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

But wait, the initial system is p + p̄. So, before the annihilation, the proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving. So the total initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

After annihilation, we have four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Wait, but that's four particles. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the specifics of their arrangement. Since the problem is symmetric, perhaps they are moving in pairs opposite to each other, so their momentum vectors add up in a way that the total momentum is conserved.

Alternatively, maybe each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) are moving in opposite directions, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed but opposite directions, but that would require a more precise setup.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving symmetrically. Maybe each A⁺ is moving in one direction and each A⁻ in another. Wait, no, that may complicate things. Alternatively, maybe each A particle is moving in opposite directions from the center, but considering that there are two pairs, perhaps the momenta are arranged such that they sum up to the initial momentum.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, I can think that the total momentum of the products is equal to the initial momentum of the antiproton (since the proton is at rest, its momentum is zero). So, the total momentum of all four A particles must equal the initial momentum of the antiproton.

Wait, but that's a lot of particles to consider. Maybe the problem simplifies in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the products are moving symmetrically, so their momenta sum up to a total that equals the initial momentum. So, perhaps each A particle has the same speed, and their momenta are arranged in opposite directions so that the vector sum is the initial momentum.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

So, initial energy: the rest energy of the proton plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Since the antiproton is slowly moving, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So, the total initial energy
