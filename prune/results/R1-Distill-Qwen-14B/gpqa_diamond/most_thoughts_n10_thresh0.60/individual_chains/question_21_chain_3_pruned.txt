Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about isomers and tautomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that compounds can be constitutional isomers or stereoisomers. I remember that constitutional isomers have different structures, like different connectivity, while stereoisomers are about spatial arrangements, like cis or trans, or enantiomers.

The question has two parts: A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structures, like keto-enol tautomerism. So, for that to happen, the compound must have a carbonyl group adjacent to an -NH or -OH group, or something that can shift.

First, benzoquinone. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. I think benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. But wait, does it have any hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups? Let me visualize. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on the benzene ring. So, each carbonyl is attached to two carbons, but the adjacent positions are on the ring. So, the carbonyls are on carbons 1 and 4 (para) or 1,2,3 (ortho, but I think benzoquinone is usually 1,4). Now, do these have any alpha hydrogens?

Wait, the carbonyl groups in benzoquinone are attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (the ones next to the carbonyl) are part of the ring. Benzene rings are spÂ² hybridized. So, the carbonyl carbons (C=O) are attached to two ring carbons. So, their adjacent carbons don't have any hydrogens attached, right? Because in a benzene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one H (or in the case of quinone, maybe a substituent). Wait, but benzoquinone is a benzene with two oxygen substituents. So,
