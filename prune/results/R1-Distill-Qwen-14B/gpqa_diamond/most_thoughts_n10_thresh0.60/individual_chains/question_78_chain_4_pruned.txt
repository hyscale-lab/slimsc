Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). We're looking at the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a later time t, where t is greater than tr (the time when the field was generated). The setup involves the origin, the field point r, and a displacement vector d from the point where the field was generated to the observation point.

Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field.

The scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law, but when the charge is moving, things get more complicated. Oh wait, right, the scalar potential for a moving charge might involve a term that includes the velocity of the charge. Or wait, maybe not directly. Wait, in the static case, V would be (q)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance from the charge. But since the charge is moving, how does this change?

Wait, I think when the charge is moving, the potentials are affected by the motion, and you have to consider retarded time or something like that. Oh right, the retarded time tr is the time when the charge's position and velocity affect the field at the current time t. So the potentials depend on the state of the charge at that earlier time.

Wait, for V,
