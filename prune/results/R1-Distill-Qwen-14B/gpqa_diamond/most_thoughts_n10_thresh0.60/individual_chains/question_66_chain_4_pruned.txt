Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I need to remember what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry in spacetime. So if Poincare is a symmetry, Lorentz must be a part of it. Wait, but wait: I think that Poincar√© symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations. But if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. But the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory. Effective theories usually include the symmetries of the underlying theory, which is the Standard Model. The Standard Model has certain symmetries. Let me think: the Standard Model has Lorentz symmetry, which is part of its gauge structure. It also has certain other symmetries like CPT, which is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal.

But wait, in SMEFT, when you write down operators, they must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. So the operators in SMEFT should generally preserve the same symmetries as the SM. So which symmetries are they?

So the SM has Lorentz symmetry, obviously. Poincare symmetry I think is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. But wait, the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory but does it necessarily have Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries, so the SM respects Poincare. But wait, in effective theories, when you write operators, sometimes you can have operators that are not invariant under some symmetries, but only certain ones.

Wait, no. Wait. In SMEFT, the operators are built in a way that respects the symmetries of the SM. So SMEFT operators must be consistent with the SM symmetries. So which of these symmetries are part of the SM?

The SM
