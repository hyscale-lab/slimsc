Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are like the classical states in quantum optics, like coherent states, while non-Gaussian states are more exotic, like cat states or Fock states. 

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. N is the normalization constant, which is the square root of (1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Oh wait, so N depends on phi and alpha.

The problem gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity, which is given by the relative entropy measure del_b. The formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. What's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the relative entropy between a non-Gaussian state and a Gaussian one would depend on which Gaussian state is chosen. But maybe in this context, the reference is the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian one? Or perhaps it's the state obtained by some approximation, like the Gaussian approximation of the non-Gaussian state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first
