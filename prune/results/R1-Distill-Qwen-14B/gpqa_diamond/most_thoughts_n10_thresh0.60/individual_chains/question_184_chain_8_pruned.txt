Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the target molecule to visualize where each substituent is. Benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in 1, and nitro in 3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the numbering. Oh, wait, benzene is a ring, so the positions are relative. Let me imagine the benzene ring: substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro. So the order around the ring is ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro in a sort of adjacent arrangement.

Now, the starting material is benzene. So I need to add these substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group and the possible reaction conditions.

I remember that substituents on a benzene ring can be activating or deactivating, and they direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Here's what I recall:

- Ethoxy group (ethoxy is an OCH2CH3 group) is an activating group because it's an electron-donating group (since it's an ether). It's an ortho/para director.
- Nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group.
- tert-Butyl group is a bulky, activating group (since alkyl groups are activating) and is an ortho/para director, but the bulkiness might influence where the substituent goes based on steric hindrance.

Wait, but when adding substituents, the order in which you add them matters because each group affects where the next will go. So I need to plan the steps in a way that each new substituent is added under the directing influence of the existing groups.

Let me think about the possible order of addition. Since nitro groups are meta directors, perhaps adding them last when the ring already has activating groups that can direct correctly.

Alternatively, maybe adding the nitro group early on, but that could complicate things because nitro is deactivating, making further substitution harder.

Wait, the target has two activating groups (ethoxy and tert-butyl) and one deactivating (nitro). But since the nitro is in a meta position relative to ethoxy. Hmm, maybe the nitro is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl are already in place.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. Let me think: if I have ethoxy and tert-butyl groups on the ring, where would the nitro group go when added last?

Alternatively, perhaps adding nitro at an intermediate stage.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible steps. The target molecule has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro.

So, each of these needs to be
