Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of relativity. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Let me start by thinking about the relative velocity. Wait, relative velocity in relativity isn't just v1 - v2. I think the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Oh wait, no, wait. Because both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed would be the difference of their speeds divided by that factor. Let me get the formula right.

So the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). Let's plug in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So v1 - v2 is 0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7, which is approximately 0.1428c, or roughly 0.14c. I think one of the options has 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Since each astronaut is moving at a relativistic speed, their energies are given by gamma * m c². So I'll calculate each individually and add them.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So v² is (0.6c)^2 = 0.36 c². 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. Sqrt of 0.64 is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Speed squared is 0.25 c². 1 - 0.25 = 0.75. Sqrt is about 0.8660 (since sqrt(3)/2 is approx 0.866). So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈ 1.1547. So energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 3 * 1.1547 is 3.4641 m c².

So total energy is 2.5 + 3.4641
