Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. So, element Y forms five different compounds with fluorine. The question is about finding the molecular weight range of substance A4.

Let me read the question again to understand each part.

First, substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF for A2 is 31.96%. Wait, oF is oxygen-free fluorine? Or maybe it's the oxidation state of fluorine in A2. Oh, wait, I think oF refers to the oxidation number. So in A2, fluorine has an oxidation state of about 31.96%. Wait, no, oxidation states are usually integers. Maybe it's the percentage composition by mass of fluorine in A2. Or perhaps it's the oxygen-free fluorine, which is a term I'm not too familiar with. Maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass.

Wait, the problem says A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So, the reaction is something like A1 → A2 + F2. Or maybe A1 → A2 + F (though F2 is more common). So, maybe A1 is a compound that upon decomposition gives A2 and F2 gas. 

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized by A1 suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing
