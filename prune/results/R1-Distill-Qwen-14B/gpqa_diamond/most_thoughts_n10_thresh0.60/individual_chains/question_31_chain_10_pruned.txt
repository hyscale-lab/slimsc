Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of product 3. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let me outline each step to understand what's happening.

1. Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. I remember that nitration typically occurs in such conditions. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration should happen at the para position because the methyl is an activating group, making the para position more favorable. So product 1 should be para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, but waitâ€”toluene undergoes nitration. The nitro group is a strong meta-directing group, but the methyl is ortho/para-directing. So the nitration of toluene would give a mixture, but primarily para. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

2. Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially under acidic conditions. I think this is a nitration followed by oxidation? No, wait, nitration is done already. Oh, maybe it's the oxidation of the nitrotoluene. Let me recall: nitrotoluene can undergo oxidation. The methyl group is attached to the benzene ring with a nitro group. When oxidized, I think the methyl group (which is a CH3 group) would be converted into a COOH group. Because MnO2 in H2SO4 is a typical oxidizing condition for that.

So product 2 would be para-nitrobenzoic acid. So the structure would be a benzene ring with a nitro group in the para position and a carboxylic acid group in the meta position relative to the nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the initial structure was toluene with methyl. After nitration, the nitro is para to the methyl. Then, the methyl (CH3) is oxidized to COOH. So the ring has a nitro and a COOH group, each attached to adjacent carbons. Wait, no. Let me visualize: Toluene is benzene with a methyl at position 1. Nitration adds nitro at position 4 (para), so the ring has methyl at 1, nitro at 4. Then, the methyl group (position 1) is oxidized to COOH. So the new groups are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (nitro). So relative to each other, they're para, I think. Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 4 are across from each other, so when you have substituents at positions 1 and 4, they are para to each other.

Wait no, wait. If the methyl is at position 1, the nitration adds nitro at position 4, which is para. Then, the methyl at 1 is oxidized to COOH. So the product is 4-nitrobenzoic acid. So the structure is a benzene ring with COOH at position 1 and nitro at position 4. So the two groups are para to each other.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, 4-nitrobenzoic acid would have the nitro group at the para position relative to the COOH group. So the two substituents
