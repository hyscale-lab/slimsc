Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the resulting NMR spectra of the product. 

Hmm, the reaction involves Compound X reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base. Oh wait, that's DABCO, right? DABCO is often used as a catalyst in certain reactions, like the formation of epoxides from alkenes using peracids. But wait, no, in this case, since it's a base, maybe it's involved in elimination or some ring-opening reaction. Alternatively, could it be used in a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps it's part of an epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them seem to be epoxides. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all of these are epoxide derivatives with styryl groups or similar structures. So Compound X is reacting under certain conditions, and the product is analyzed via NMR.

Wait, the question says the product's NMR is given. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination or some kind of rearrangement, and the product is a diastereomer or something else. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Wait, no. Because the product's NMR is what's given, and the options are for what Compound X is. So I think the reaction is forming a new compound from X, and we have to figure out what X was based on the product's data.

Wait, but how? Because if the product is the result of a reaction, perhaps the structure of X is the starting material that after reaction becomes the product. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening, but given the options, maybe it's more about an epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is
