Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) cleavage reaction, especially for ozonolysis. Wait no, wait. Ozonolysis is usually with ozone, then workup. Oh wait, but red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroboration-oxidation? No, wait, another reaction. Oh right, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg) and HCl, but that's for reducing ketones to alkanes. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Oh, wait! Red phosphorus with HI is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but that's not it. Or wait, another possibility: the reaction of alkenes with HX, like addition reactions. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where a triple bond is being converted. Oh wait, wait. Oh, right! When an alkyne is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction called "hydrohalogenation" or " hydration addition," where the triple bond is converted into a diol, but wait, that's with H2SO4 and HgSO4. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, if the
