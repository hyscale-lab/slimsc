Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are the infinities that pop up in calculations. Regularization helps make these calculations finite so you can handle them properly. But some theories might not need this because maybe their structure avoids these divergences naturally.

So let's break down each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is different because it's a theory of everything, incorporating gravity as well. Strings vibrate at different frequencies, and their interactions are different from point particles. But wait, do they still have divergences? I think in string theory, the high-energy behavior is better. Because strings have a minimum length scale beyond the Planck scale, maybe they don't have the same kind of divergences as point particles. So regularization might not be needed here. I'm not entirely sure, but that sounds familiar.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I remember that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory. At high energies (or equivalently, short distances), the coupling constant becomes weaker due to asymptotic freedom. But wait, does that mean divergences
