Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest chance of transiting because they have limited time. Both planets were detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses are known, and they both have circular orbits. 

Wait, the key here is to calculate the probability of each planet transiting its star. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Oh right, the formula for transit probability is something like (R_star / a_orbit) * (something else).

Wait, more accurately, the probability P is proportional to (R_star / a) * (1/(1 - eÂ²))^(1/2), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term (e) is zero, so that part is 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_star / a) multiplied by (something else, wait... maybe the impact parameter affects it, but the maximum probability is when the orbit is edge-on, which is what we want. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.)

Wait, no, I think the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star / a. So the transit probability is proportional to R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis (or orbital radius) of the planet.

Wait no, wait. Another thought: The formula I remember is that the probability is (R*/a) * (1 + R_p/R*), but since R_p is much smaller than R*, it's approximated as R* / a. So the probability is roughly R* / a.

But wait, the actual formula might also involve the inclination. Oh, right, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital radius. Because the planet can only transit if its orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight, so the probability is (R* / a) * (some other factors?), but I think for circular orbits, it's just R* / a.

Wait, no, I think the
