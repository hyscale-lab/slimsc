A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Additionally, meso compounds, which have stereocenters but also a plane of symmetry, are not optically active.\n\n### Analysis of Each Compound:\n\n1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  \n   This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. For a carbon attached to a double bond to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. However, the substituents on C1 (Cl, a methyl group, and two hydrogens) are not all different, so C1 is not a chiral center. Thus, this compound is **not optically active**.\n\n2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  \n   This compound has a bicyclic structure with two stereocenters at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (3aR,7aS) notation. Since it has chiral centers and no plane of symmetry, it is **optically active**.\n\n3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  \n   Succinic acid has a chain of four carbons with carboxylic acid groups at both ends. In this compound, the two middle carbons (C2 and C3) each have a methyl group and are in the (2R,3S) configuration. These carbons are chiral centers, and the molecule is not meso because the configurations are not mirror images. Thus, it is **optically active**.\n\n4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  \n   Similar to the previous compound, this molecule has two chiral centers at C2 and C3, both in the R configuration. The molecule is not meso, so it is **optically active**.\n\n5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  \n   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group at C1. The substituents on C1 are OH, two different CH2 groups (from the ring), and a hydrogen. Since all four groups are different, C1 is a chiral center, making the molecule **optically active**.\n\n6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  \n   This compound has hydroxyl groups at C1, C3, and C5. However, each of these carbons has two identical CH2 groups as substituents, meaning none of them are chiral centers. Thus, the molecule is **not optically active**.\n\n7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  \n   This compound has a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1) and a methyl group at C3. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center due to the double bond to oxygen. None of the other carbons in the molecule have four different substituents, so there are no chiral centers. Thus, the molecule is **not optically active**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  \n- Compound 2  \n- Compound 3  \n- Compound 4  \n- Compound 5  \n\nThis gives a total of **4 optically active compounds**.\n\n**Answer: D**"
