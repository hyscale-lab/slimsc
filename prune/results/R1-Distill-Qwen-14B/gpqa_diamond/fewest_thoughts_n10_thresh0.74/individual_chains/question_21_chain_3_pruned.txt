Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about isomers and tautomerism. Let me think through this step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is determining which compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

First, let me understand the concepts involved.

Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in a different structure. This usually involves the movement of a hydrogen from an oxygen to a neighboring carbon, or vice versa. The classic example is ketones and aldehydes in keto-enol tautomerism.

Constitutional isomers are isomers that have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. Stereoisomers, on the other hand, have the same connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement, which includes geometric isomerism and optical isomerism.

Now, looking at part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which I think is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Quinones are known to undergo keto-enol tautomerism because they have conjugated carbonyl groups. Wait, but wait—benzoquinone is cyclic and has two ketones opposite each other. So would it tautomerize? Or maybe it's more stable in one form and doesn't tautomerize much? Hmm.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups equally spaced around a cyclohexane ring. Now, each ketone is at a position where the ring can allow for conjugation. I remember that when a molecule has multiple conjugated carbonyl groups, it can exhibit keto-enol tautomerism. Wait, no—if a compound has multiple ketones, like tricyclic structures, can they tautomerize? Alternatively, if the structure is such that the enol form isn't possible because the necessary hydrogens aren't present, then tautomerism wouldn't occur.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione—each carbonyl is at a position where perhaps there's no adjacent hydrogen to form an enol. Let me visualize the structure. It's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. Each ketone is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, each carbonyl is adjacent to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each ketone is on a carbon that's adjacent to two other carbons. So, each carbonyl group is C=O, and the adjacent carbons are CH2 groups. So each CH2 is adjacent to a C=O.

Wait, for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Wait, no, in keto-enol tautomerism, the hydrogen is on the alpha carbon (the one adjacent to the carbonyl). So in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each of the three carbonyl carbons is
