Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think it through step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, meaning it's shaped like a sphere but maybe elongated along the z-axis. The symmetry axis is along the z-axis, so whatever is happening, it's symmetric around that axis. Because the charge is oscillating, it should radiate electromagnetic waves, right?

The problem says that the radiation has a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, which I think is the region far from the charge, the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta. Theta is the angle with the z-axis. So, the power radiated in different directions varies with theta.

The maximum power is given as A. They are asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f in terms of lambda.

The options are A, B, C, D. Each gives a fraction and a lambda dependency.

First, I need to figure out the form of f(theta). I remember that for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of theta. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the cosine of theta squared, or something like that.

Wait, the dipole radiation pattern. Oh right, the power pattern for a dipole is proportional to (sin theta)^2. Because the maximum is at theta = 90 degrees, and it drops off towards theta = 0 and 180. But wait, wait, in this case, the charge distribution is spheroidal, so maybe it's a quadrupole or another multipole? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but I think that for a dipole, the radiation pattern is symmetric around the axis, so the intensity goes as sin^2 theta. So maximum at theta=90 degrees. But wait, the function f would be the power per unit solid angle. So the power pattern would be f(theta) = something involving sin^2 theta.

Wait, but the function f is a function of lambda and theta. So, maybe the dependence on lambda is
