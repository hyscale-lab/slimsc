Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I remember that the Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian states. So when they're superposed, the state becomes non-Gaussian, right?

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). Wait, let me make sure I got that right. So N squared is 1 + sin(2 phi) times e^(-2 alpha²). Oh wait, no, N is the square root of that, so N² would be 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha²). That makes sense because the norm is the square of the coefficient, so the denominator in the state is N.

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is a reference Gaussian state. Oh, right, the idea is that the relative entropy of entanglement or something similar between the state and the Gaussian reference. So the non-Gaussianity would be the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

Our task is to calculate nG at phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5.

Wait, but what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the problem says tau is a density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. I think in some cases, the reference might be the closest Gaussian state to the given state, or perhaps the completely mixed state? Or maybe it's the state that maximizes entropy among Gaussian states? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a cat state, the reference Gaussian state is the density matrix that is the closest Gaussian approximation to the cat state. But I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the non-Gaussianity measure here is calculated by comparing the state to a Gaussian
