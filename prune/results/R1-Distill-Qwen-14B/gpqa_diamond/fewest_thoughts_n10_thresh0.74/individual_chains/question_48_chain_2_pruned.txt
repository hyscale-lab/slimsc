Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. Hmm, when ketones react with bromine, I think about the possible reactions. Wait, bromine can undergo addition reactions. Oh right! The enol formation. So cyclohexanone would form an enol, which would then react with bromine. Or wait, maybe it's a different pathway. Oh, I think it's more about the alpha position. Oh wait, another possibility: maybe it's a nucleophilic attack, but ketones aren't usually that reactive towards electrophiles without some catalyst. Oh wait, maybe it's the benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, I think the reaction of ketones with bromine could lead to the formation of a dibromide. Wait, wait, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl). So when Br2 is added, it might abstract a hydrogen from the alpha position, forming an enol which then adds bromine. Alternatively, it's a dihalide formation.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, but that's for carboxylic acids, I think. No, cyclohexanone is a ketone. Oh, wait, perhaps it's the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. But cyclohexanone is a ketone; bromine might add to the carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromide addition to the alpha position. So, cyclohexanone has two alpha hydrogens (each adjacent to the carbonyl). Adding Br2 could lead to the formation of a dibromide. Oh wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone; adding Br2 would likely lead to the formation of a vicinal dihalide. So, the first step would be the cyclohexanone reacting with bromine to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or maybe cyclohexane-1,2-diol bromide
