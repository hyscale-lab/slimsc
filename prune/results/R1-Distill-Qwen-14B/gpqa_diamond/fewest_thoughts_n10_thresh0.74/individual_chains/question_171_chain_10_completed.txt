Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. The question is asking me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced. Hmm, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, directing groups on the benzene ring determine where the substitution occurs. 

Let me list the substances again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

Wait, I think I need to figure out the directing effect of each substituent. Ortho/para directors activate the ring, while meta directors deactivate. Also, activating groups increase the rate of substitution, but where exactly depends on their directing nature.

So each substituent here is attached to the benzene ring. Let's go through each one:

1. CH3 (toluene): Methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the ring will substitute in either ortho, meta, or para positions. Wait, but methyl is a strong activating group, so para and ortho are favored. Wait, but when substituents are bulky, the para tends to be more favored because ortho might be harder to approach. Toluene has a methyl group, which is bulky compared to H, so maybe it's more para than ortho? Or maybe meta? No, wait, methyl is an activating, ortho/para director. So the substitution occurs in ortho, para. But when the substituent is bulky, the major product could be para. Wait, in toluene substitution, I think the para product is major when possible. But wait, in the case of toluene with Br2, it undergoes bromination. The products would be a mix of ortho and para, but since methyl is bulky, para might be the major product.

2. COOEt (ethyl benzoate): The ester group is a meta director. Wait, no, wait. Ester groups (like OCOOR) are electron-withdrawing by the carbonyl, which makes them meta directors. So substitution would be in the meta position. But wait, the ester is an ortho/para director? No, I think I might be mixing this up. Let me think. Nitro groups are strong meta directors. Esters, like benzoate, have a carbonyl group, which is electron-withdrawing, so they are meta directors. So the substituent would direct Br to the meta position. But wait, wait, in some cases, substituents can be deactivating but meta directors. So yes, for the ester group, substitution occurs at meta. So the major product would be meta, which means in this case, para is not a major product. Wait, the question is about the para-isomer. So for this substance, the para would be minor. So the weight fraction of para would be low.

3. Cl (chlorobenzene): Chlorine is a deactivating group because of its electronegativity. But wait, Cl is a unique substituent. Chlorine is a meta director, but wait, isn't Cl an ortho/para director? Because Cl has lone pairs, it donates electrons through resonance, making it an ortho/para director. But since it's more electronegative, it's a weak activating group. So substitution occurs at ortho and para, but Cl is a deactivating group, so the ring is less reactive than benzene. But the directing effect is ortho/para. So in chlorobenzene, the major products would be ortho and para. But because of steric hindrance, sometimes para is favored. Wait, but if the substituent is in para, then the ortho positions are adjacent, which are more hindered. So for Cl, in electrophilic substitution, the main products are meta? Wait, no, no. I'm getting confused. Let's clarify. Cl is an ortho/para director, so substitution occurs at those positions. But wait, that's when the substituent is activating. Wait, Cl is a deactivating group because of its inductive effect (electron-withdrawing), but due to its lone pairs, it's an ortho/para director. So substitution occurs at ortho and para, making them the major products. Now, for chlorobenzene, the substitution can occur at ortho, meta, or para? No, no, wait. Chlorine is a meta director? No, no, I've read that Cl is an ortho/para director because of resonance. So in substitution, Cl directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So the major products would be ortho and para. But wait, wait, in reality, for chlorobenzene, the Br substitution is more likely to occur in the para position because the ortho positions are adjacent to Cl, leading to steric hindrance. So perhaps in practice, the para is the major product. So the weight fraction of the para isomer for substance 3 would be higher.

4. NO2 (nitrobenzene): Nitro is a strong deactivating group and a meta director. So substitution occurs mainly in the meta position, making para a minor product. So the para isomer would have a lower weight fraction.

5. C2H5 (ethylbenzene): The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. Similar to toluene, but ethyl is larger. So substitution occurs at ortho and para, with para being the major due to steric hindrance. So the para fraction is high.

6. COOH (benzoic acid): The carboxylic acid group is a strong deactivating group, electron-withdrawing, so it's a meta director. So substitution would occur at meta, making para a minor product. So para's weight fraction is low.

Now, the question is arranging the substances in order of increasing weight fraction of para. So from least para to most.

So, let's list each substance's para fraction:

1) Toluene (para is significant, maybe major)

2) COOEt: Para is minor (since substitution is meta)

3) Cl: Para is major

4) NO2: Para is minor

5) C2H5: Para is major

6) COOH: Para is minor

Wait, but let me think again. Let me list each substituent's para-directing nature, or how much para product they form.

1) Toluene (methyl): para is major.

3) Cl: para is major.

5) ethyl: para is major.

Substances 2, 4, 6: their substituents are meta directors, so their para products are minor. So the para fractions for 2,4,6 are low.

So now, among 1,3,5, the para fractions are high. But how to order them?

Wait, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, the para isomer's percentage.

Wait, wait, but in case of multiple substitution, but in this case, each is monobromo substitution. So each substituent directs the Br to specific positions.

Wait, but for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the substitution can lead to more than one product. For example, in toluene, the Br can go ortho, meta, or para. But the meta is unlikely due to the substituent being activating, so ortho and para are possible. But when the substituent is bulky, para becomes the major product. So in toluene, the major product is para-bromotoluene.

Similarly, ethylbenzene would have para as major.

Chlorobenzene: since Cl is a weakly activating group and an ortho/para director, substitution can occur there. But sometimes, the ortho product might be less favored due to steric hindrance, making para the major, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, in chlorobenzene, the para is major.

So, the para fractions:

Substance 1: Toluene: high.

Substance 3: Cl: high.

Substance 5: ethyl: high.

Substances 2,4,6: low.

Now, among the high para fractions, how do they compare?

I think that the substituents' activating power and their steric bulk influence the ratio between ortho and para.

Toluene (methyl) and ethylbenzene (ethyl) are both activating, ortho/para directors. But ethyl is bulkier than methyl, so perhaps in ethylbenzene, the para product is more favored because of steric hindrance in the ortho positions. So maybe ethylbenzene has a higher para fraction than toluene.

Chlorobenzene: Cl is an ortho/para director but is deactivating. Wait, no, Cl is ortho/para but deactivating. So the ring is less reactive than benzene, but the substitution is still directed to ortho and para. But I'm not sure how the para fraction compares to toluene and ethylbenzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups have higher para fractions.

Wait, but in chlorobenzene, the ortho position is adjacent to Cl, which is a bigger substituent than methyl or ethyl. So maybe the para is major in chlorobenzene as well, but perhaps the para fraction is lower than in toluene and ethylbenzene.

Wait, maybe I should think about the actual major products.

Toluene with excess Br2: major product is para-bromotoluene.

Ethylbenzene: major product is also para-bromoethylbenzene.

Chlorobenzene: major product is para-bromochlorobenzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, chlorobenzene undergoes substitution more at the para position because the ortho positions are too hindered.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky on this. Let me try to remember the relative rates.

I think that the para fraction is highest for substituents that are bulky and ortho/para directors. So ethylbenzene has a higher para fraction than toluene because ethyl is bulkier. Toluene's para fraction is higher than chlorobenzene's because Cl is smaller and less bulky, so ortho could be more feasible, making para a less dominant product than in ethylbenzene?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If Cl is a substituent, and it's less bulky, the ortho positions are more easily accessible, so ortho product may be more, making para less. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps chlorobenzene's para fraction is higher than toluene because the substituent is deactivating but still ortho/para.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the relative activating strength. An activating group directs more substitution. So if the substituent is strongly activating, the para product would be more. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the order of para fractions is:

Substance 5 (ethylbenzene) has the highest para fraction.

Then, substance 3 (chlorobenzene) has a high para fraction.

Substance 1 (toluene) is next.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps chlorobenzene's para fraction is lower than toluene's because Cl is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive, but not necessarily affecting the para fraction directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fractions are as follows:

Substances with substituents that are strongly activating and ortho/para directors have higher para fractions, and bulkier substituents increase the para fraction.

So ethylbenzene (5) has the highest para fraction.

Then toluene (1) next.

Then chlorobenzene (3) next, but wait, chlorobenzene's substituent is deactivating, so maybe the para fraction is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fractions for 5 > 1 > 3.

I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the order is:

The para fraction increases in the order: 2 < 4 < 6 < 3 < 1 <5.

Wait, no, let me think.

The substances with substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) have minimal para product. Then, among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para fraction increases with the substituent's bulk and activating power.

So 1 (methyl), 3 (Cl), 5 (ethyl): substituents' activating strength: ethyl (5) is more activating than methyl (1), which is more activating than Cl (3), since Cl is deactivating.

Wait, no. Chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Methyl is activating.

So the activating power order:

5 (ethyl) > 1 (methyl) > 3 (Cl) ?

Wait, but Cl is a deactivating group. So perhaps 3 is less activating, so the para fraction would be lower than 1 and 5.

So the order of para fractions is:

Lowest: 2,4,6 → 2 (COOEt), then 4 (NO2), then 6 (COOH). Because COOEt is an ester, which is more deactivating than COOH (since COOH is more acidic, hence more deactivating? Or wait, COOEt is an ester, which is a stronger deactivating group than Cl but weaker than NO2 and COOH.

Wait, no. The general order of deactivating (electron-withdrawing) groups is: -NO2 > -COOH > -COOR (ester) > -Cl.

So for the substituents in substances 2,4,6:

2: COOEt (ester) → meta director. Since it's an EWG, the para product is minor.

4: NO2 → meta director, so even less para.

6: COOH → meta director, but stronger EWG than ester.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are all meta directors, so their para products are minor. So the order of their para fractions is:

The more deactivating, the less reactive the ring is, but the directing is meta. So which of these substituents would lead to a higher or lower para fraction?

Wait, perhaps for the meta-directors, the para fraction is the same, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups lead to more para, and deactivating groups lead to less.

Wait, getting confused. Let me think again. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for substituents that are meta directors, para is not a major product.

So for the meta directors, the para fraction is low. So their order in terms of para fraction would be from lower to higher.

Wait, but if substituent is a stronger deactivating group (like NO2), the ring is less reactive, so substitution is more difficult, but the directing is meta. So the para product is minimal regardless.

Hmm, perhaps the order for para fractions is:

Substance 2 (COOEt) has para fraction low.

Substance 4 (NO2): even lower? Or higher than 2? I'm not sure.

Wait, but I think the substituents' strength as meta directors don't directly affect the para fraction. Instead, their effect is that they direct substitution elsewhere, making para a minor product.

So among 2,4,6, the para fractions are all low, but perhaps 4 (NO2) has the least para, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt). Or maybe the opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to withdraw electrons affects the rate of substitution, but the position is determined by the substituent.

Wait, but all three (2,4,6) are meta directors. So regardless of their strength, the para product would be minor. So perhaps the order among them is 6 < 4 < 2? Or maybe 4 < 2 <6.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's think of para fractions as:

Substituents that are meta directors (2,4,6) have low para fractions. So their order in terms of increasing para fraction would be from lowest to highest. 

But which of these has the lowest para?

The strongest deactivating groups are NO2 (4) and COOH (6), with COOEt (2) being less deactivating.

So perhaps the para fractions are lower for stronger deactivators, because the ring is less reactive. So the para fraction for 4 < 6 < 2.

So 4 has the least para, then 6, then 2.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the order is 6 < 4 < 2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the substituents:

- Nitro (4) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So any substitution leads to meta, but since the ring is deactivated, the reaction may be slower, but the position is determined by the substituent.

- COOH (6) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

- COOEt (2) is a deactivating, meta-directing group, but perhaps less so than NO2 and COOH.

So, the substituents in order of deactivation strength (strongest to weakest): NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

So, for their para fractions, which are all low, the order of increasing para fraction would be: NO2 (4) < COOH (6) < COOEt (2).

So, the first three substances in the order are 4,6,2.

Then, among the ortho/para directors (1,3,5), the para fractions are higher. The order among them would be?

Substance 5 (ethyl) has a bulkier substituent than 1 (methyl) and 3 (Cl). So ethyl would have the highest para fraction because the substituent is bulky, making para more favored.

Then, substance 1 (methyl) has a less bulky substituent than ethyl, so para is still major, but perhaps less than ethyl.

Substance 3 (Cl) is a substituent that is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Because Cl is less bulky than ethyl, but more bulky than methyl, perhaps its para fraction is higher than toluene but lower than ethylbenzene.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think of the substituents' effect on para fraction.

Ethyl is bulkier than methyl and Cl, so para is favored more. So 5 (ethyl) has the highest para fraction, followed by 3 (Cl), then 1 (methyl).

Wait, but wait, Cl is less bulky than ethyl, but more bulky than methyl. So for substitution, in chlorobenzene, the para product is major, but perhaps the fraction is higher than toluene.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck again. Let me think of actual examples.

In bromination of toluene, the para product is major. Same with ethylbenzene, where the para is major. Chlorobenzene's para product is major, but perhaps the para fraction is the same as toluene or lower.

Alternatively, because Cl is electron-withdrawing, the ring is less activated, so the para fraction might be similar or lower than toluene.

Hmm, perhaps I should just look for the correct order.

Wait, the options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B) 6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So the order is from least to most.

So the correct order for the substances would be: substances with the lowest para fraction first, then higher.

So the order would be:

Substances 4,6,2 (all meta directors, low para) followed by 1,3,5.

Now, the meta directors: 4 <6 <2 in terms of para fractions.

Then, the ortho/para directors: 1 <3 <5.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ortho/para directors have higher para fractions.

Putting it all together, the order would be:

4 (NO2, lowest para) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt) <1 (toluene) <3 (Cl) <5 (ethylbenzene, highest para).

Wait, but that would be 4 <6 <2 <1 <3 <5.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3. No, our order ends with 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the ortho/para directors. Let me think again.

The ortho/para directors are 1,3,5.

Among them, which has the lowest para fraction? Probably the least activating group.

But wait, the substituent in 3 (Cl) is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive. So substitution is less likely to occur, but when it does, it's directed to ortho and para. But perhaps the para fraction is lower than the activating substituents.

Wait, but whether the substituent is activating or deactivating might not directly affect the para fraction. It affects the reactivity, but the position is determined by the director.

So for 1 (toluene, activating), para is major.

3 (Cl, deactivating but ortho/para directing), para is also major, but perhaps less than 1.

5 (ethyl, activating), para is major.

So among 1,3,5, perhaps 1 and 5 have higher para fractions, with 3 being lower.

Wait, perhaps chlorobenzene has a lower para fraction than toluene, but higher than the meta directors.

No, that can't be. Because for Cl, it's a meta director but wait no, Cl is ortho/para. So the para product is significant but perhaps less than toluene.

Wait, maybe the order is:

meta directors: 4 <6 <2.

Then, ortho/para directors: 3 <1 <5.

So overall order: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, that's option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5? No, option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, but according to our order, it's 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Hmm, none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach: the weight fraction of the para isomer depends on how much substitution happens at the para position. For substituents that are meta directors, the para is very low. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para is higher.

So, the lowest para fractions are for the meta directors.

Among the meta directors, which substituent leads to the least para?

Order of substituents' deactivating strength: NO2 > COOH > COOEt.

So, for meta directors, the substituent's strength affects the para fraction inversely. So, the stronger the deactivator, the lower the para fraction because the substitution is less likely, but the position is meta.

Wait, but if the substituent is a strong deactivator, the reaction is slower, but it's still directed to meta. So the para fraction is low, but perhaps the substituent's strength doesn't directly affect the para fraction beyond directing.

Wait, perhaps for meta directors, the para fraction is always low. So the order between 2,4,6 is that 4 (NO2) has the least para, followed by 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt).

So, 4 <6 <2.

Then, for the ortho/para directors, which substituents have the lowest para fraction?

Among 1,3,5:

Substance 3 (Cl) is a deactivating, ortho/para director. So substitution occurs, but the ring is less reactive. So perhaps the para fraction is lower than for activating groups.

Substance 1 (methyl) and 5 (ethyl) are activating, leading to more substitution in ortho and para.

So perhaps the order is 3 <1 <5, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if Cl is a deactivating substituent, the reaction is slower, so the percentage yield is lower for the para, but I'm not sure how that affects the fraction. Because even though the reaction is slower, if the substituent directs to para, then the fraction is higher than meta directors.

But the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So if the substituent is a deactivating ortho/para director, substitution occurs, but the amount of para is lower compared to activating groups.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4<2<6<3<1<5. No, that's not matching.

Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No.

Option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5. Doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of the order based on substituent's directing effect and activating/deactivating nature.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

The substances with substituents that are meta directors have the lowest para fractions, followed by those with deactivating substituents that are ortho/para directors (like Cl), and then the activating substituents which have higher para fractions.

So the order from least to most para fraction would be:

4 (NO2, meta) <6 (COOH, meta) <2 (COOEt, meta) <3 (Cl, ortho/para but deactivating) <1 (methyl, ortho/para and activating) <5 (ethyl, ortho/para and activating).

So the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, option A is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

No, that's not matching. Option A: 4, then 2, then 6, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent's effect on the yield.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. So the fraction is higher for substituents that direct to para.

So, the order is:

Substances with substituents that are meta directors: their para fractions are low, so they come first.

Then, the substituents that are ortho/para directors but deactivating (like Cl). Their para fractions are higher than meta directors but lower than activating substituents.

Finally, the substituents that are ortho/para directors and activating (like methyl and ethyl) have the highest para fractions.

So, the order would be:

4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt) <3 (Cl) <1 (toluene) <5 (ethylbenzene).

So the order is 4<6<2<3<1<5.

Looking at the options, does any option match?

Option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3. No, it ends with 5<3, which is not matching.

Option D:3 <5 <1 <6 <2 <4. No.

Option B: 6<2<4<5<1<3. No.

Hmm. None of the options exactly match this order. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternative approach: perhaps the substituents' activating strength affects the para fraction.

So, among the ortho/para directors, the more activating the substituent, the higher the para fraction.

So, the order would be:

Substituent strength (activating): ethyl (5) > methyl (1) > Cl (3).

Wait, but Cl is a deactivating group, so perhaps 3 has a lower para fraction than 1 and 5.

Thus, the para fractions among 1,3,5 would be 5 >1 >3.

So, the overall order would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, looking at the options, this order isn't present.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the substituent is activating or deactivating. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, leading to more substitution, but in terms of para fraction, perhaps substituents that are activating have higher para fractions.

So, the order of para fractions would be:

Substances with meta directors (4,6,2) have low para.

Then, substances with deactivating ortho/para directors (3) have lower para than activating ortho/para directors (1,5).

So, 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, none of the options A to D match this. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the options are:

A)4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

None of them have 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should consider whether the substituent is activating or deactivating and their effect on the para fraction.

Wait, another thought: the more activating the group, the more the ring is reactive, leading to more substitution, but the position is determined by the directing effect.

But for the para fraction, perhaps the substituent's ability to direct to para depends on whether it is ortho/para or meta.

So, the para fraction is only significant for ortho/para directors.

So, the order would be:

Substances 4,6,2 (meta directors) have the least para.

Among them, the order is 4 <6 <2.

Then, substances 3 (Cl, deactivating, ortho/para) have lower para than activating substituents.

Then, 1 (methyl) and 5 (ethyl).

So, the order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

But in that case, 2 comes after 4, which would mean 4 has lower para than 2. But 4 is a stronger meta director than 2.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and 2 has a higher para fraction than 4, which is impossible since 2 is a meta director.

No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the para fractions for meta directors are all low, but for ortho/para directors, para is higher.

So, substances 4,6,2 have low para fractions, while 1,3,5 have higher.

So, the order would be:

4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: perhaps the most deactivating meta director (NO2) leads to the least para product, followed by COOH, then COOEt.

So, 4 <6 <2.

Then, among the ortho/para directors, Cl (3) has the lowest para fraction because it's deactivating, followed by toluene (1), then ethylbenzene (5).

So, 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

No, that would mean 3 comes after 5, which is ethylbenzene, which I think has a higher para fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of which option makes sense.

Looking at option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

So the order is:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Does that make sense?

4 (NO2) is first, then 6 (COOH), then 2 (COOEt), then 1 (toluene), then 5 (ethyl), then 3 (Cl).

Wait, but I thought that 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than 1 (toluene), which is an activating group.

No, that doesn't make sense. Because toluene is activating, its para fraction should be higher than Cl's.

So perhaps the correct order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But again, no option matches that.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

But in this case, 2 comes after 4, meaning 4 has lower para than 2, which is a meta director. That can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the options in the given choices and think which one fits.

Another approach: the para fraction is highest for the most activating ortho/para directors.

So 5 (ethyl) has the highest.

Then, 1 (toluene).

Then, 3 (Cl) which is deactivating but ortho/para.

Meta directors 2,4,6 have low para, but in what order.

Wait, perhaps among 2,4,6, the substituent's strength as deactivating affects the para fraction inversely. So stronger deactivators (NO2) have lower para fractions, weaker deactivators (COOEt) have higher.

So, 4 (NO2) <6 (COOH) <2 (COOEt).

Then, among the ortho/para directors: 3 <1 <5.

So overall order:4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But no option matches.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, but that would imply 3 has a higher para fraction than 5, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of substituents among 1,3,5.

Wait, perhaps I should think that 3 (Cl) has a lower para fraction than 1 and 5 because Cl is deactivating.

So the order for 1,3,5 is 3 <1 <5.

Thus, the overall order is 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

But as there is no such option, perhaps I should look for the option that starts with 4 <6 <2.

Looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3.

That would mean after 4,6,2 comes 1,5,3.

But 3 is Cl, which has a higher para fraction than 1 and 5? No.

This is getting really confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A:4<2<6<3<1<5.

But I don't see why 2 would come after 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents' directing effects.

Another approach: for each substituent, write down whether it is meta or ortho/para, and whether activating or deactivating.

1: methyl → ortho/para, activating → high para.

2: COOEt → meta, deactivating → low para.

3: Cl → ortho/para, deactivating → high para, but perhaps less than activating groups.

4: NO2 → meta, deactivating → low para.

5: ethyl → ortho/para, activating → high para.

6: COOH → meta, deactivating → low para.

So, substances 2,4,6 have low para fractions. Among them, the order is 4 <6 <2 because NO2 is strongest deactivator, then COOH, then ester.

So 4 <6 <2.

Then, substances 1,3,5 have higher para fractions. Among these:

3 (Cl) is ortho/para but deactivating → lower para than activating substituents.

1 (methyl) is activating → high para.

5 (ethyl) is activating, bulkier → higher para than 1.

So the order is 3 <1 <5.

Putting it all together: 4 <6 <2 <3 <1 <5.

Looking at the options, no option matches this. So perhaps the correct ordering is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But that would place 3 after 5, which (Cl) has a lower para fraction than 5. So that makes sense.

Wait, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

So the order is:

4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

Wait, that's not correct because 3 (Cl) is an ortho/para director, so should have higher para than 2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But I'm not confident.

Given the confusion and the time I've spent, perhaps the correct answer is option C:4<6<2<1<5<3.

But I'm not sure.


The question involves arranging six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed during an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. The key factors influencing the para fraction are the nature of the substituent (activating or deactivating) and its directing effect (ortho/para or meta). 

### Analysis of Substituents:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**:  
   Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the para product is favored, resulting in a high para fraction.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ethyl benzoate)**:  
   The ester group (-COOEt) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs at the meta position, leading to a low para fraction.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**:  
   Chlorine is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group. Substitution occurs at ortho and para positions, but the para fraction is lower than for strongly activating groups like methyl or ethyl.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**:  
   Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs at the meta position, resulting in a very low para fraction.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**:  
   Ethyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Due to its bulkiness, the para product is highly favored, leading to the highest para fraction among the ortho/para directors.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic acid)**:  
   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Substitution occurs at the meta position, resulting in a low para fraction.

### Ordering the Substances:
- **Meta-directing groups (2, 4, 6)**: These have low para fractions. Among them, the strength of deactivation determines the order: **4 (NO2) < 6 (COOH) < 2 (COOEt)**.
- **Ortho/para-directing groups (1, 3, 5)**: These have higher para fractions. Among them, the activating power and steric bulk determine the order: **3 (Cl) < 1 (CH3) < 5 (C2H5)**.

Combining these, the overall order of increasing para fraction is:  
**4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: 4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5 (Incorrect, as 6 should come before 2).  
- **Option B**: 6 < 2 < 4 < 5 < 1 < 3 (Incorrect, as 4 should come before 6).  
- **Option C**: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3 (Incorrect, as 3 should come before 1).  
- **Option D**: 3 < 5 < 1 < 6 < 2 < 4 (Incorrect, as 4, 6, and 2 should come first).

None of the options match the correct order **4 < 6 < 2 < 3 < 1 < 5**. However, based on the given options, the closest match is **Option C**, which partially aligns with the reasoning.
