Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution typically occurs on aromatic rings, and the substituents on the ring can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

The question lists six substances, each being a benzene derivative with different substituents. The task is to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo bromination with excess Br2. So, the one with the lowest para yield comes first, and the one with the highest comes last.

Wait, wait. Let me think about each substituent's directing effects. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and based on that, they direct the incoming group to specific positions.

1) C6H5-CH3 — that's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine adds, the para product should be a major one. But wait, steric hindrance can sometimes affect this. Methyl is a bulky group, but in toluene, the para position is more accessible than the ortho, so para is major.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 — that's ethyl benzoate. The ester group (COOEt) is electron-withdrawing because of the carbonyl. So it's a deactivating group. Now, I think esters are meta-directing. So substituting in the meta position would be major. But wait, isn't the ester group an activating group? No, wait. The carbonyl makes it deactivating? No, wait, the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl, making it deactivating. So the ring becomes less reactive, but the substituent is meta-directing. So in bromination, the para product would be minor, and meta major. So the para-isomer is less favored here.

3) C6H5-Cl — chlorobenzene. Chlorine is an electron-withdrawing group because of its electronegativity, but it's ortho/para-directing. Wait, isn't Cl a slightly deactivating group but ortho/para-directing? Because Cl has lone pairs, which can donate electrons through resonance, but the inductive effect is stronger, making it deactivating overall. So it directs ortho and para. So in bromination, para is a possible major product, but since it's deactivating, the reaction might be slower. But in terms of the distribution, Cl directs ortho/para, so para is significant but maybe not the major.

Wait, but wait, for chlorobenzene, the para product is major. Because Cl directs to ortho and para, but bromine in excess would lead to more substitution. Wait, but when the substituent is deactivating, the ring is less reactive. So the reaction may take longer, but the regiochemistry is based on directing.

4) C6H5-NO2 — nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So when bromine adds, it'll go into the meta position. So the para product would be minimal here. So substance 4 would have the least para-isomer.

5) C6H5-C2H5 — ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when brominating, the para product is major. But wait, bulky groups might lead to more para? Because the ortho positions are harder to reach. For example, in toluene (methyl), para is major. Ethyl is larger, so maybe even more para. So substance 5 would have a high para yield.

6) C6H5-COOH — benzoic acid. The COOH group is a strong deactivating group. It's a meta-directing group. So when bromine adds, it'll go
