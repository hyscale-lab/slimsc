Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted aromatic compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says it's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So, the aromatic ring is a benzene ring, which has 6 carbons. The di-substituted means there are two substituents attached to it. Since the total is 8 carbons, the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Hmm, wait, but substituents can vary. Let me think: each substituent could be a single group. So, for example, two substituents each contributing one carbon would sum to 2. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero, but that can't be since it's di-substituted. Oh, right, di-substituted implies two substituents on the ring.

The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X, where X is halogen). So the substituents on the benzene ring must be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but what groups have a carbonyl? Possible substituents could be ketones, aldehydes, esters, amides, etc. But since the compound is di-substituted, we have two groups: one with carbonyl and another with halogen.

Wait, but wait a second. The ring has 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6 carbons, so the substituents add 2 carbons in total. So each substituent must be a single carbon group. Let me think: possible substituents that have a carbonyl. For example, a carbonyl group could be a ketone (like -CO-) but wait, that's two oxygen, but perhaps a substituent like -COCH3. No, wait, substituting a benzene ring with a carbonyl group? Like a ketone attached directly? Wait, a benzoyl group would be C6H5-C=O, but that would be one substituent, adding one carbon beyond the ring. Wait, but the ring is already 6 carbons, so 6 + substituents' carbons = 8.

So substit
