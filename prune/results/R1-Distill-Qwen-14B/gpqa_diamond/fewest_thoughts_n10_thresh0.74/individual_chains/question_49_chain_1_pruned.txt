Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because pericyclic reactions can be a bit tricky. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which are a type of pericyclic reaction. From what I remember, sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond within a conjugated sigma bond system. So the terminal pi bond moves into a sigma bond, causing some kind of structural change.

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out what each product (A, B, C) is. Then, match them with the options provided.

Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

First Reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm. So the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The reagents are H+ and heat, which probably mean some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... that structure is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Or maybe it's (HO(CH2)2NMe2?), no, wait. Let me draw it. The structure would be ethan-1-amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon (the 1st carbon). So the molecule is NH2-C(CH3O)2.

Wait, but that's an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Wait, but how is that possible? Oh, maybe it's H2N-C(OCH3)2-CH3? No, I think that's better written as (CH3O)2CHNH2. So the molecule is H2N-CH(CH2OCH3)2? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. The formula for 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(NH2)(OCH3)2. So the central carbon has NH2, OCH3, OCH3.

But wait, the other reactant is but-3
