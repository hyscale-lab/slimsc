Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and together integrate to 1H. So, each peak is about 0.5H? Or maybe they're splitting each other, but the integral adds up correctly. The problem mentions that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh, right, because if it were coupling, you'd expect more splitting, like a doublet or something. So maybe it's not splitting from neighboring protons.

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So the molecular weight is consistent, but there are two separate peaks. Since the MS has the same mass, it's not a fragment or a different molecule. It could be an isomer or something related but with the same molecular weight.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if it's a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have a larger molecular weight before a reaction (like if it was before a coupling step). But the MS shows same mass, so probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so that would fit the MS. But in NMR, enantiomers don't split each other's signals because they are mirror images. So each enantiomer would have the same NMR spectrum, meaning you'd see the same peaks. But in this case, the NMR has two separate peaks for the same proton. Wait, no. Enantiomers don't cause splitting. So if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would still show a single peak because the environments are identical for each enantiomer. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, double coupling? I'm not exactly sure what that means. Amide bonds form through reactions like coupling (e.g., using HATU or EDCl/DMAP). But how would that cause double peaks? Maybe if there's an issue during the reaction where the amide is formed with some leftover reagents or something. Or perhaps it's a diastereomer because of the stereochemistry in the amide formation. Wait, but the question says the coupling is ruled out. So maybe it's a coupling during the reaction that's causing some byproduct, but I'm not sure.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would show up as separate peaks in LC-MS. In NMR, each diastereomer would have different chemical shifts. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. If they were diastereomers, their shifts might not be exactly the same. But then again, if the diastereomers are similar in structure, maybe the shifts are close. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. How would diastereomers cause that? Each diastereomer would have its own set of protons. Wait, maybe the diastereomers have the same proton environment for that particular alpha-pro
