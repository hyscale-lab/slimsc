Okay, so I have this chemistry question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about isomers and some specific compounds. Let's break it down.

The first part of the question is about tautomerism. The question asks which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. Hmm, I remember that tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen and the resulting change in the structure, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So which of these compounds can't do that?

Benzoquinone is, I think, a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone has two ketone groups? Or is it an aromatic ring with two oxygen atoms? Oh wait, benzoquinone is actually a cyclic di-ketone, like two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. So the structure would be O=C6H4=O. So it has two ketone groups.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, right? So that's a six-membered ring with three oxygen atoms attached as ketones. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O, but in a ring. 

Now, tautomerism usually happens when there's an adjacent hydrogen that can shift. For example, in a cyclic diketone like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, you can have tautomerism because the hydrogen can shift between the two carbonyls. But in benzoquinone, the two carbonyls are on a benzene ring which is conjugated. Wait, can the hydrogen shift there? Benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, but the positions are para, right? So the structure is more like 1,4-diketone on benzene. Wait, no, actually, benzoquinone is more like 1,2? Or is it 1,4? I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, benzoquinone is 1,4-diketone, right? So it's O=C-C6H2-CO. No, wait, benzene is C6H6. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups. So it
