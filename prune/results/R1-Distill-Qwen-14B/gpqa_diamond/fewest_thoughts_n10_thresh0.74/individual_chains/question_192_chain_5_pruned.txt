Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, I'll try to think it through step by step.

The setup is a spherical conductor with radius R, and it's initially uncharged. There's a small cavity inside it, which is also spherical with radius r, and r is less than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So, imagine the conductor is a big sphere, and the cavity is a smaller sphere not exactly at the center but shifted by s.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember that in electrostatics, the behavior of charges in conductors and cavities is important. So, the conductor is uncharged, but when a charge is placed in the cavity, what happens? Oh right, the charges in the conductor will redistribute. But wait, because the conductor is neutral, the charges induced on the inner and outer surfaces must balance.

Wait, when you have a cavity with a charge inside, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge. Since the conductor is neutral, the inner surface must have a charge equal and opposite to the charge inside the cavity. So, in this case, the inner surface would have a charge of -q. Then, the outer surface must have a charge +q to make the total charge zero (since the conductor was uncharged before).

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The conductor is initially neutral. When a charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part that's the cavity's wall) must have an induced charge of -q. Because the conductor's material is conducting, the charges will flow to the surfaces. So the inner surface has -q, which would mean the outer surface must have +q to balance, keeping the conductor's total charge zero. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor was neutral, so the total charge after must still be zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to balance that.
