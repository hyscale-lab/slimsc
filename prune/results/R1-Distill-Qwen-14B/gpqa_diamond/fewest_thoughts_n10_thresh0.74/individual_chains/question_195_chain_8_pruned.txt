Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question is about two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has Earth's radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet is larger, 2.5 times Earth's radius. They want the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur. 

Wait, transit and occultation. Hmm. I remember that a transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we don't see its light anymore. For both to happen, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the observer's line of sight is edge-on. Also, the planet's orbital period has to be such that the two events can occur without the planet moving too fast or too slow.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect whether these events happen? Oh, right. The orbital period determines how long it takes for the planet to go around the star. For a transit, the planet needs to pass in front of the star, which requires the orbit to be along our line of sight. But for occultation, the planet has to pass behind the star. So the orbital period affects how often these events happen, but more importantly, for both events to be possible, the planet must have an orbital period that allows it to be in the right position for both.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Both transit and occultation require that the planet's orbit is viewed edge-on. So if that's the case, the inclination is 90 degrees. So the first condition is that both planets are in the same orbital plane and edge-on. 

But the question is about the maximum possible period for the second planet such that both events occur. Oh, perhaps it's about the orbital speed and the size of the orbit. Because a longer period means a larger orbit (since, for a star, larger orbits have longer periods). But the transit and occultation require that the planet's orbit is such that it can both pass in front and behind the star. 

Wait, no. For a transit, the planet must pass in front of the star. For occultation, it must pass behind. So the planet must have an orbit where, at some point, it's on the near side of the star (transit) and at another point, it's on the far side (occultation). So the planet's orbital radius must be such that when it's on the near side, it's within the star's disk (from our view), and when it's on the far side, it's beyond the star's disk.

Wait, but how does the period come into play? Oh, perhaps the orbital speed. The transit occurs when the planet moves across the star's disk. For the planet to transit, its orbital speed must be such that it can cover the star's disk in a certain time. But wait, the orbital period is
