Okay, so I have this physics problem here about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. Alright, the question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. Oh right, the divergence theorem says that the integral of div F over a volume V is equal to the flux of F through the boundary surface of V. So in this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R, so the boundary is the surface of the sphere at radius R.

But wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral of the divergence, which by the divergence theorem would be equal to the surface integral of F dot dA over the sphere. So maybe I don't need to compute the divergence at all? Or do I?

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the divergence first and then integrate. Let's think about that. The field f(r) is radially directed, so in spherical coordinates, only the r component is non-zero. Let me denote f(r) = f_r(r) r̂. Then the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r) ). 

Since f_r(r) is 1/r², let's compute the divergence. So f_r = 1/r², so plugging into the divergence formula:

div F = (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r
