Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let's read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² and only has a radial component. So, I need to find ∫ (∇·f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

Wait, right, divergence theorem comes into play here. Oh wait, no, wait. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. But wait, the problem is directly asking for the volume integral. Hmm, but maybe using the divergence theorem can help. Alternatively, I can compute the divergence first and then integrate.

So, the field is purely radial. So in spherical coordinates, f(r) has components (f_r, 0, 0), right? Because radial direction only. And since it's 1/r², f_r = 1/r².

To find the divergence, I remember that in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A is (1/(r²)) * d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) * d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) * [d(A_φ)/dφ]/(r). But since A_θ and A_φ are zero here, the other terms vanish.

So, ∇·f is (1/r²) * d(r² * f_r)/dr. Let's compute that. f_r
