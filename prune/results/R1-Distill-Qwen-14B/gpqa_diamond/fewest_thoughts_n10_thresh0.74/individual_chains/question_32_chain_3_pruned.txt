Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons, so I guess that's something like Li-6 or Li-7? Wait, no, wait. Wait, Lithium normally has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. Wait, actually, Li typically has an atomic number of 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, that's 3 + 3 = 6, so it's Li-6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I remember that in these kinds of problems, the rest mass energy might be needed. So I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. The energy in particle physics is often given in GeV (gigaelectronvolts). 

So the formula I remember for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate gamma first.

Gamma calculation: 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0
