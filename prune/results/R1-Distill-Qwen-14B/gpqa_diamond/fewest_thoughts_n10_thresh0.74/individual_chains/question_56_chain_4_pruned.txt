Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Let me think through this. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions follow certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but more specifically, the transition is allowed if Δl = ±1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m changes by 0, ±1. So for each transition, l must change by exactly 1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The final state is n=1, l=0, m=0. But the decay is via two dipole transitions, so it's a two-step process. So first, from 3,0,0 to some intermediate state, and then from that state to 1,0,0.

So, what are the possible intermediate states after the first transition? Let's think. The first transition must follow the selection rule, so from l=0, the next possible l is l=1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. So the intermediate state would be, for example, n=2, l=1, m=?

But wait, the initial m is 0. So in the first transition, m can change by -1, 0, +1. So the possible m's for the intermediate state would be m = -1, 0, +1.

But then, from that intermediate state, the next transition must go to n=1, l=0. So the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0, so Δl = -1. That's allowed.

Wait, but what's the selection rule for n? The n can change by any integer as long as the dipole transition is possible. So from n=3, first transition can go to n=2 or n=4 (though n=4 is higher, but in this case, since we're going to n=1, probably n=2 is the intermediate).

So the first step is from n=3, l=0 to
