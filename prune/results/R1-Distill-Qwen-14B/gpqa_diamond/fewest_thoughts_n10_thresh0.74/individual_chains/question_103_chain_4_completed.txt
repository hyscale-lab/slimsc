Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

Let me first visualize the target molecule. The structure is ethan-1-one with a substituted phenyl group. The phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Specifically, at position 3 there's a bromine, and at position 5, a nitro group. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, ethan-1-one means the ketone is on the ethyl group attached to the benzene. So the benzene is attached to a CH2CO group. So the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and a CH2COCH3 group? Wait no, wait. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO–CH2–, but wait wait, no, ethan-1-one is CH3CO-. Wait, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one), but wait no, ethan-1-one is the same as acetone? No, wait, acetone is (propan-2-one). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone where the carbonyl is at the end. So it's O=C-CH2- something. Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO, but wait, that's acetone, which is propan-2-one. Wait, maybe I'm getting the nomenclature wrong. Oh wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-CO-CH2-... No, wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-CH2-CO something? No, that can't be right. Wait, wait, the position is on the first carbon of ethane, so ethane is two carbons. So the carbonyl can't be on the first carbon because that would make it a terminal carbonyl, but in a ketone, the carbonyl is between two carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3, which is acetophenone. But wait, the given compound is 1-(substituted phenyl)ethan-1-one, which would be (Ph)C(O)CH3, but then numbering would be different. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the phenyl group is attached to the ethan-1-one, which is a two-carbon chain with the ketone at the end. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that can't be because ethan-1-one is a two-carbon chain, so it's Ph-CH2-CO, but that's a three-carbon chain. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, the name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one part would be (CH2)1-CO-CH3? Wait no, wait. The substituents are on the ethan-1-one. Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and attached to the ring is a CH2-CO- group. Oh wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone where the carbonyl is on the first carbon of ethane. But ethane has two carbons, so the carbonyl would have to be on the first, making it a terminal group, which isn't possible for a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethan-1-one is actually acetophenone, where the benzene is attached to the methyl group adjacent to the carbonyl. So the structure would be benzene attached to a carbonyl group with a methyl on one side and another substituent on the benzene. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene with a substituent that's an ethanone group, specifically a CH2 attached to the benzene and a carbonyl on the CH2. Wait, that would be Ph-CH2-CO-R, but R would have to be another group. But ethan-1-one is a two-carbon chain, so the carbonyl is on the first carbon. That would make it O=C-CH2-Ph. Wait, that's possible.

Wait, but ethan-1-one is CH3-CO-CH2-Ph? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CO-CH3, which would be 3-bromo-5-nitrophenylacetone. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the substituents' positions. The benzene has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. Wait, maybe the ketone is attached to the benzene ring at position 1, and then the bromine is at position 3, and the nitro group at position 5.

Wait, perhaps the benzene ring has the ketone group (from the ethanone) attached at position 1. Then, positions 3 and 5 have Br and NO2 groups. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. So the ring has three substituents: the ketone group (attached at position 1), Br at position 3, and NO2 at position 5.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring. So if the ketone is at position 1, then position 3 is two positions away, and position 5 is four positions away. Wait, no, in benzene, positions are numbered in such a way that substituents are as close as possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the ketone is at the ortho position relative to Br and meta to NO2, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how to synthesize this compound. The starting material is benzene. So I need to introduce substituents on the benzene ring in the correct positions and then form the ketone group.

Let me think about the directing effects of substituents. Nitro is a meta director. Bromine can be either ortho/para or meta depending on the substituent. Wait, no. Bromine is an ortho/para director when it's attached to the ring, but in this case, perhaps it's a substituent that comes later.

Wait, perhaps the steps involve nitrating, then brominating, then acetylating or something like that. Or maybe the other way around. Alternatively, maybe we need to introduce the substituents in a specific order to get the correct positions.

Wait, benzene is first nitrated? Let's consider that. If I nitrate benzene, I get nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director. So next substituents would enter in the meta position. But wait, the target has two substituents besides the ketone group, but perhaps the ketone group is added later.

Wait, but the target molecule has two substituents on the benzene ring: Br and NO2. So I need to introduce both of those, plus the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is to first nitrate, then brominate, but directions matter. Let me think.

Let's say I start with benzene. First, I nitrate it. Nitration of benzene with HNO3/H2SO4 gives nitrobenzene. Nitro is a meta director. So the next substituent would go into the meta position relative to nitro.

If the next step is bromination, using Br2/FeBr3, which is a Friedel-Crafts bromination. Wait, wait, no. Wait, bromination of benzene using FeBr3 is a substitution reaction. So FeBr3 is a Lewis acid catalyst for electrophilic substitution. So after nitrobenzene, which is a meta director, if we brominate, the Br would enter in the meta position relative to nitro. So nitro at position 1, Br at position 3.

Then, the next step would be introducing the ketone group. But ketones are typically introduced via acetylation, like using CH3COCl with AlCl3 as a catalyst. Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires the ring to be activated, meaning it's electron-rich. Nitro groups are deactivating, so after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts might not work. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the order should be to nitrate, then acetylate, but that might not be possible either if the ring is too deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the order is to nitrate, then introduce another substituent, then acetylate. But wait, the target has Br and NO2 on the benzene, and the acetyl group attached as the ketone. So perhaps the acetyl group is added via Friedel-Crafts acylation, but that requires the ring to be activated. So if the ring is deactivated due to nitro groups, that won't work. So perhaps the acylation needs to happen earlier, before the nitro group is introduced.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose I first acetylate benzene. So benzene reacted with CH3COCl and AlCl3 would give acetophenone. Then, I can nitrate the acetophenone. Acetophenone has a ketone group, which is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG), so it's a meta director.

Nitration of acetophenone would introduce the nitro group in the meta position relative to the ketone. So now the ring has a ketone at position 1, nitro at position 3. Then, perhaps a bromination step. But wait, the nitro is a strong EWG, so the ring would be deactivated. So would bromination be possible? Alternatively, perhaps I need to have the ring more activated for substitution.

Wait, but in the target, the Br is at position 3 relative to the ketone. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me try to outline possible steps.

Optionally, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Nitration of benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Bromination → Br in meta to nitro.

3. Friedel-Crafts acylation → but wait, the ring is already deactivated by nitro, so this won't work. So that doesn't make sense.

Alternative approach: Maybe the ketone (acetyl group) is introduced first. Benzene → acetophenone via Friedel-Crafts acylation. Now, the ring has the ketone group which is meta-directing.

Then, nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to the ketone → so nitro at position 3.

Then, bromination. But wait, after nitration, the ring has a nitro group (strong EWG) and a ketone (also EWG). The ring is highly deactivated. So bromination with FeBr3 may not proceed.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the bromination needs to happen before the nitration, but then the directing would be different.

Wait, let's try another approach. Suppose benzene is first brominated. So, benzene → bromobenzene (using Br2/FeBr3). Then, nitration. Bromobenzene is a meta director. So nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to Br. So positions 1 (Br) and 4 (NO2). Wait, but the target has Br and NO2 at positions 3 and 5. Hmm, perhaps not matching.

Wait, maybe I need to brominate after nitration. Let's think. Benzene → nitrate to nitrobenzene. Then brominate → Br in meta position relative to nitro → positions 1 (NO2) and 3 (Br). Then, introducing the ketone group. But as before, the ring is deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Hmm, perhaps the ketone is introduced via another method. Maybe if I have a methyl group attached first, then oxidize it to a ketone. But how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced via a benzylation or some other reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the order is to first introduce the substituents, then perform an acylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first nitrate, then brominate in a position that's meta to nitro, then acetylate. But the acetylation would require a ring that's activated. So perhaps the acetyl group is not introduced via Friedel-Crafts, but perhaps via some other method.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is introduced as a side chain. Wait, maybe via a Grignard reagent. Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl group is introduced after the nitro and bromine substituents. But again, the ring is deactivated, which would prevent Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the possibility of using a directing group. For example, if I have a substituent that can direct incoming groups where I want them, perhaps in a certain order.

Wait, another thought: maybe the nitro group is introduced first, then the bromine in the meta position relative to nitro, then the acetylation. But again, the ring is deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So perhaps the acetylation step needs to come earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylation is done before nitration. So, benzene → acetylation → acetophenone. Now, acetophenone's ketone group is meta-directing. Then, nitration would add nitro in the meta position relative to the ketone → positions 1 (ketone) and 4 (nitro). Wait, but the target has Br at position 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps after nitration, I can brominate. So, acetophenone → nitrate → now has nitro in meta position (position 4). Then, bromination. But since the ring already has a ketone and nitro, it's deactivated. So FeBr3 won't help. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the bromine is introduced before the nitro. So benzene → brominate → bromobenzene (Br in position 1). Then, nitration. Since Br is a meta director, the nitro would go into position 4. So now the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4. Then, acetylation. But the ring is deactivated by nitro and Br (which is a deactivating group), so Friedel-Crafts won't work. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should introduce the acetyl group as a methyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that's less common because it can lead to carbocation rearrangements. But in this case, perhaps it's possible. Then, after alkylation, the methyl group is oxidized to a ketone. But wait, oxidation of a methyl group attached to benzene is usually difficult unless it's part of a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to first introduce the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts acylation, then nitrate, then brominate. Let me see.

Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1). Then, nitrate: acetophenone directs incoming nitro to position 3. So nitro at 3. Now the ring has acetophenone (1) and nitro (3). Now, bromine would go where? Since nitro is a strong meta director, and the ring is already deactivating, but perhaps we can introduce Br. Wait, but the ring is deactivated, so electrophilic substitution is difficult. So perhaps bromination is not feasible at this stage.

Hmm. So perhaps the order is to introduce nitro, then acetyl, then bromine. Let's try.

Benzene → nitrate → nitrobenzene (position 1). Then, acetylation: but ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So that's a problem.

Another angle: maybe the nitro group is introduced via a different method, such as using a diazonium salt. Wait, sometimes nitro groups are introduced using the diazotization method. For example, benzenediazonium chloride can be nitrated under certain conditions. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the acetyl group is attached. So benzene → acetylation → acetophenone. Then, nitration. Acetophenone's ketone directs nitro to position 3. Now, the ring has acetophenone (1) and nitro (3). Now, bromination: but the ring is deactivated, so bromine won't substitute.

Wait, but perhaps the bromine is introduced via a different method. Maybe via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires specific conditions and activating groups.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I need to look at the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Steps are HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acetylation), Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), then another nitration, etc. Wait, but why would you nitrate again?

Wait, let me go step by step for each option.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acylation) → acetophenone. ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction of nitro to amine?). v) HNO3 again. That seems messy.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene. ii) nitrate. iii) acylate. iv) nitrate again. Hmm, multiple nitrations?

Option C: i) nitrate → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine (but why? Not sure). iii) acylate. iv) brominate. v) nitrate again. vi) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization). vii) H3PO2 (maybe for something else).

Option D: i) nitrate → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. iv) H3PO2 (what's that for? Maybe to form a phenol? Or for some other substitution). v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. vi) acylate. vii) nitrate again.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the correct order.

We have to have the acetyl group (from ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene ring. So, if we can perform Friedel-Crafts acylation early enough before the ring gets deactivated by nitro groups, that might work.

So step 1: Acetylate benzene → acetophenone.

Step 2: Nitrate acetophenone → nitro group in meta (position 3 relative to ketone).

Step 3: Brominate → but after nitration, the ring is deactivated. So bromination might not work.

Wait, unless the bromination is done before the nitration. Let me think.

Alternative approach: First, nitrate benzene. Then brominate in meta. Then acetylate. But then, the ring is deactivated by nitro, so acetylation via Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylation is done after introducing a group that activates the ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the bromination is done via a different mechanism. For example, using a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced first, then a methyl group is introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which can then be oxidized to a ketone. But that seems complicated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced via a benzylic position. For instance, after introducing a substituent that can be oxidized to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Nitration → nitrobenzene.

2. Hydrogenation → reduce nitro to amine. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first nitrate, then brominate, then introduce the acetyl group via a different method.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C: The steps are nitrate, Fe/HCl, acylate, brominate, nitrate again, etc. Hmm, multiple nitrations might not make sense. Let me see.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro group on benzene. ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce nitro to amine. iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again. vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. vii) H3PO2 → what's that for? H3PO2 is a reducing agent, perhaps for something else.

Wait, but the target has nitro and bromo groups. Maybe the second nitration is not needed. So perhaps option C is not correct.

Option D: i) nitrate → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine? Then, step iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. iv) H3PO2 → what does that do? Maybe for a Sandmeyer reaction, but without a copper catalyst, perhaps for some other substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option's sequence.

Option C:

Step 1: Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: Fe/HCl → Fe is a reducing agent? Maybe reduce nitro to amine. So now, the ring has an amine group.

Step 3: Acetylation → CH3COCl/AlCl3 → but amine is a strong activating group. So the acetylation would occur in the ortho/para positions.

Wait, but the target has the acetyl group attached at a specific position relative to Br and NO2.

Wait, after step 2, the benzene has an amine group (-NH2). So when acetylation is done, the acetyl group would enter ortho or para to the amine.

But the target has the acetyl group at position 1, with Br at 3 and NO2 at 5. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a different reaction. Wait, Fe/HCl: perhaps it's a way to prepare a benzene ring with a substituent that can be further functionalized.

This is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to draw each option's possible products.

Let me take option C:

Option C steps:

i) Nitrate benzene: nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl: Fe is a reducing agent; perhaps reduces nitro to amine, so now benzene has -NH2 at position 1.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3: acetylation. Since -NH2 is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So acetylation would occur at position 3 or 5.

Wait, but the target has the acetyl group (as part of ethan-1-one) attached in a specific position.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the target structure wrong.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

So the structure is:

Ph group: positions 3 (Br), 5 (NO2), and the ketone group attached at position 1.

So, the benzene has substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So it's a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, that's a symmetric structure. So after nitration, bromination, and acetylation, the substituents are placed at the correct positions.

So, perhaps the order is to nitrate first, then brominate, then acetylate, but making sure each step's directing groups are correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the acetylation is done first, then nitration, then bromination.

So:

1. Benzene → acetylation → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Nitration: acetophenone directs nitro to position 3.

3. Bromination: but after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so bromination won't proceed with FeBr3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromination is done using a different method, like using a directing group.

Wait, maybe I can use a benzyl chloride or some other approach, but that's probably beyond the options given.

Looking at option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. Acetophenone directs Br to meta, which is position 3 relative to ketone.

So, bromine at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Now, acetophenone (meta director) and Br (ortho/para director). But the nitration would be influenced by both.

Wait, but the acetophenone is a meta director, while Br is an ortho/para director. Which one has a stronger directing effect?

Well, the directing effect depends on the activating/deactivating nature. Acetophenone's ketone is deactivating (EWG), so it's a meta director. Br is deactivating (EWG), so also a meta director but in a different way. Wait, actually, bromine is ortho/para director because, despite being deactivating, it's a strong meta director? No, wait, no. Bromine attached to benzene is an ortho/para director because it's a substituent with a lone pair which can conjugate, but it's deactivating due to the electronegativity.

Wait, no. Wait, substituents can be ortho/para directors because they are activating (like -OCH3) or deactivating but have lone pairs (like -NO2 is meta director, but -Br is ortho/para director despite being deactivating). So if the ring has both a ketone (meta) and Br (ortho/para), which group will direct the next substitution?

The substituents' directing effects are based on their activating or deactivating nature and their position. The most activating group will direct the incoming electrophile.

In this case, after step ii in option A, the ring has Br at position 3 and ketone at position 1. Now, in step iii, nitrating would occur where?

Wait, the ketone is a strong deactivating group (meta director), and Br is a deactivating group but an ortho/para director. But which group is more influential? Probably the nitration would occur under the influence of the strongest directing group. Since both are deactivating, perhaps the most activating substituent, which is Br (since it's ortho/para), directs the incoming nitro group.

Wait, but nitration is a strong electrophilic substitution. The ring is already deactivated by both substituents, so maybe nitration is difficult. But assuming it can proceed, where would the nitro group go?

The Br is at position 3. Since Br is ortho/para directing, the incoming nitro would go to position 2 (ortho to Br) or position 4 (para to Br). But in the target, nitro is at position 5 relative to the ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in the position directed by the ketone. Since ketone is meta director, and it's at position 1, the nitro would go to position 4. But the target has nitro at position 5 relative to ketone. Hmm, not matching.

So perhaps option A isn't the right sequence.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Br is ortho/para director. So nitro would go to position 2 or 4. Let's say position 4.

Now, the ring has Br at 1 and nitro at 4.

Step iii) acetylation: CH3COCl/AlCl3. Now, the ring has Br (ortho/para) and nitro (meta). Which directs the acetyl group?

The ring is highly deactivated by nitro, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So step iii in option B is impossible. So option B is out.

Option C:

i) nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So ring has NH2 at 1.

iii) acetylation → CH3COCl/AlCl3. NH2 is strong activating, so acetyl would go ortho or para to NH2. Let's say position 3.

So now, ring has NH2 at 1, acetyl at 3.

Step iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. The directing groups are acetyl (meta) and NH2 (strong activating, ortho/para). So the incoming Br would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl, which is at 3). Or ortho to NH2 (positions 2 and 6). So not sure.

But the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe after acetylation, the ring has NH2 and acetyl, and then bromination would occur ortho to NH2, which is at 2. Not matching the target.

Hmm. Not matching.

Option D:

i) nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So NH2 at 1.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. Then, H3PO2. Wait, H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Diazonium salt can undergo various reactions. With H3PO2, perhaps it's a Sandmeyer-type reaction, but I'm not certain.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

v) acetylation → CH3COCl/AlCl3.

vi) nitrate again.

But this seems complicated. Let me think.

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce to amine (NH2 at 1).

Step iii: diazotization. Then, H3PO2 is used, perhaps for a hydrolysis or substitution. Alternatively, maybe a Gattermann reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Maybe it's used to reduce some group.

Alternatively, perhaps step iv is bromination after the ring has an amine group. So, bromination would occur ortho/para to NH2.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct sequence is option C.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct sequence is to first nitrate to get nitro in position 1, then brominate in position 3, then acetylate in position 5. But that would require the ring to have the substituents in a certain order.

Wait, but after nitration and bromination, the ring has nitro (1) and Br (3). Then, acetylation would require the ring to be activated. But it's deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So that's not possible.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylation is done via a different method, such as using a Grignard reagent, but that's not part of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first brominate, then nitrate, then acetylate. Let's see.

Benzene → brominate → Br at 1.

Then, nitrate. Br is ortho/para director, so nitro can go to 2 or 4.

Then, acetylate. But again, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the acetylation is done via a directing group that allows it to occur despite the presence of strong EWGs.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the acetylation, but in such a way that it goes to the correct position.

So, benzene → acetylate → acetophenone.

Then, nitrate. Acetophenone is meta director, so nitro goes to 3.

Now, the ring has ketone (1) and nitro (3). Now, bromination. But the ring is deactivated. So this won't proceed.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a different method. Let me think about the options again.

Looking back, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me try to walk through it.

Option C steps:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene (nitro at 1).

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. Now, ring has NH2 at 1.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation. Since NH2 is a strong activating group, the acetyl will enter ortho or para to NH2. Let's say position 3.

Now, ring has NH2 (1), acetyl (3).

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. Now, the directing groups are NH2 (activating, ortho/para) and acetyl (deactivating, meta). So the incoming Br would likely go ortho to NH2, which is position 2, or para, which is position 6. Alternatively, perhaps meta to acetyl (position 6). But the target requires Br at 3 relative to the ketone.

Wait, but the target has the Br at position 3. Wait, in this case, acetyl is at 3. So Br would be at position 3, but that's where the acetyl is. Not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br goes to position 5, which is meta to acetyl. But that's not necessarily directed by the existing substituents.

Hmmm.

Another approach: After step ii, the ring has NH2 at 1. Then, acetylation occurs at position 3 (ortho to NH2). Then, bromination occurs where? The acetyl is a meta director, so the Br would go to position 6 (meta to acetyl, which is at 3). But the target wants Br at position 3, which is now occupied by the acetyl.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Maybe the acetyl is at position 3, and the Br goes to position 5.

But in that case, the substituents would be at 1 (NH2), 3 (acetyl), and 5 (Br). Then, after that, step v is another nitration. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the next step is nitration, which would put nitro group in position 5, which is meta to acetyl, but then step v is nitration again? That seems complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about the target structure again. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents on the benzene are: at position 1, the ketone; at position 3, bromine; and at position 5, nitro.

So the substituents are at 1, 3, and 5, making a symmetric arrangement. So perhaps the steps need to introduce these substituents in such a way that each is added in the correct position, considering the directing effects of previously added groups.

So the first substitution is the ketone group. Then, nitro and Br are added in the correct positions.

But how to get that.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Acetylate benzene → acetophenone (ketone at 1).

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Brominate → Br at 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3, and para to ketone at 1? Or in a different position.

Wait, after step 2, the ring has ketone (1) and nitro (3).

Then, bromination: the ring has nitro (3) and ketone (1). Nitro is meta director, ketone is also meta director. So where will Br go?

Well, both substituents are meta directors. The ring is deactivated, so it's hard to brominate. But assuming it can, the Br would go to position 5 (meta to nitro at 3) and position 5 is also meta to ketone at 1? Wait, no. If the ketone is at 1, the meta position is 4. But if nitro is at 3, then meta is 6.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine goes to position 5, which is meta to the nitro (3), but that's also para to the ketone (1). Hmm.

Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions. Let's number them clockwise:

1: ketone.

2: 

3: nitro.

4: 

5: 

6: 

So, the ring is 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro). Now, bromination would occur where?

Nitro is meta director, so incoming Br would go to position 6 (meta to 3). But the target has Br at 3.

Wait, that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, if the ketone is at position 1, and nitro is at position 3, then the bromine should go to position 5, which is meta to nitro (3) and meta to ketone (1) as well.

Because 1's meta is 4, 3's meta is 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the positions.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the target structure. If the substituents are at 1,3,5, then each is two positions apart. So each substituent is meta to the next.

So the sequence would be:

1. Acetylate benzene → ketone at 1.

2. Nitrate → nitro at 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Brominate → Br at 5 (meta to nitro, which is at 3, but also meta to ketone? Or para?)

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the positions again.

Another approach: perhaps the correct order is to first nitrate, then brominate, then acetylate, but in a way that the acetylation occurs in a position directed by the other substituents.

But I'm not seeing it.

Looking back at the options, perhaps option C is the correct one. Let me recap option C's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine. So now, ring has NH2 at 1.

iii) Acetylate → CH3COCl/AlCl3. NH2 is activating, so acetyl goes ortho or para. Let's say position 3.

iv) Brominate → Br2/FeBr3. Now, with substituents at 1 (NH2), 3 (acetyl), and the directing is influenced by both. NH2 is ortho/para, acetyl is meta. So Br would go to position 5 (ortho to NH2 is 2 and 6; para is 4. Alternatively, meta to acetyl is 6. Hmm, not sure.

v) Nitrate again → HNO3/H2SO4. Now, where would this go? The ring has NH2 (1), acetyl (3), Br (5). Nitration would be directed by these groups.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → not sure.

This seems complicated, but perhaps after these steps, the substituents end up in the correct positions. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option C: i) nitrate, ii) reduce, iii) acetylate, iv) brominate, v) nitrate again, vi) diazotize, vii) use H3PO2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C.

Wait, the target molecule has a nitro group at position 5. So perhaps the nitration occurs after the bromine is introduced.

Looking at option D:

i) nitrate → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → maybe hydrolysis to form a phenol.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate.

vii) nitrate again.

Hmm, perhaps after reducing nitro to amine, then diazotizing and using H3PO2 might lead to a substitution. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, another thought: in the target, the nitro group is at position 5 relative to the ketone. So perhaps the ketone is introduced first, then the nitro group in the correct position, then the bromine.

But how to achieve that.

Another approach: maybe the correct sequence is to first nitrate, then brominate, then perform a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylation is done via a benzyne intermediate, but that's probably not relevant here.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but considering the options, option C has the nitration first, then steps that would position the substituents correctly. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents (bromine, nitro, and the ketone group) in the correct positions on the benzene ring, considering the directing effects of each substituent and the activation state of the ring.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Acetylation of benzene to form acetophenone. The ketone group is introduced at position 1.
2. **Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination occurs. The ketone is a meta-director, so bromine would likely go to position 3.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrating acetophenone. The ketone is a meta-director, so nitro would likely go to position 5.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduction of nitro to amine (not relevant for the target structure).
5. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Additional nitration (unnecessary for the target structure).
6. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization (not relevant for the target structure).
7. **H₃PO₂**: Reducing agent (not relevant for the target structure).

This sequence introduces the substituents in the correct positions but includes unnecessary steps like multiple nitrations and diazotization.

#### **Option B**:
1. **Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination of benzene to form bromobenzene. Bromine is introduced at position 1.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrating bromobenzene. Bromine is an ortho/para-director, so nitro would go to position 2 or 4.
3. **CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Acetylation. The ring is deactivated by the nitro group, so Friedel-Crafts acylation would not proceed.

This sequence fails because the ring is deactivated after nitration, preventing acetylation.

#### **Option C**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrating benzene to form nitrobenzene. Nitro is introduced at position 1.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reducing the nitro group to an amine (-NH₂). The ring now has -NH₂ at position 1.
3. **CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Acetylation. The -NH₂ group is a strong activating, ortho/para-director, so the acetyl group would go to position 3.
4. **Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so bromine would go to position 5.
5. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrating the ring. The acetyl group is a meta-director, so nitro would go to position 5 (but this step is unnecessary as nitro is already present).
6. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization (not relevant for the target structure).
7. **H₃PO₂**: Reducing agent (not relevant for the target structure).

This sequence introduces the substituents in the correct positions but includes unnecessary steps like additional nitration and diazotization.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrating benzene to form nitrobenzene. Nitro is introduced at position 1.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reducing the nitro group to an amine (-NH₂). The ring now has -NH₂ at position 1.
3. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization of the -NH₂ group (not relevant for the target structure).
4. **H₃PO₂**: Reducing agent (not relevant for the target structure).
5. **Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination. The -NH₂ group is an ortho/para-director, so bromine would go to position 2 or 6.
6. **CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Acetylation. The ring is deactivated by the nitro group, so Friedel-Crafts acylation would not proceed.
7. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitrating the ring (unnecessary for the target structure).

This sequence fails because the acetylation step does not proceed due to the deactivated ring.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the most plausible sequence, as it introduces the substituents in the correct positions (nitro at 1, acetyl at 3, bromine at 5) and aligns with the target structure. While it includes unnecessary steps, it is the only option that successfully positions all substituents correctly.
