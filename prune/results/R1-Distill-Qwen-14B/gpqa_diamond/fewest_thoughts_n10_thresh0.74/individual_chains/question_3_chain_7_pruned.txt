Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And I'm supposed to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, okay. I remember that σz and σx are the Pauli matrices, which are used in quantum mechanics to represent spin operators.

Wait, the expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator gives the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So the expectation value of 10σz +5σx would be 10 times the expectation of σz plus 5 times the expectation of σx.

And since expectation values are linear, I can calculate each part separately and then combine them. That's probably the way to go.

First, let's write down the state vector. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I should check if it's normalized. Let's compute the probabilities: |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. Adding them gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1, so yes, it's normalized. Good, that's one less thing to worry about.

Now, for the expectation value of σz. σz is diagonal in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩, right? Because σz|↑⟩ = |↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

So the expectation value of σz, ⟨σz⟩, is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. Let's calculate that.

The first term is 0.5 squared, which is 0.25, multiplied by +1. The second term is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 which is 3/4, multiplied by -1. So 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1). Let me compute that: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, the expectation value for 10σz would be 10 times that, so 10*(-0.5) = -5. But wait, I think I should handle the entire operator's expectation value by computing each part. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the full expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx as a whole. Hmm.

But since expectation values are linear, I can compute each part separately. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So I already have ⟨σz⟩ as -0.5, so 10*(-0.5) is -5. Now I need ⟨σx⟩.

How do I compute ⟨σx⟩ for this state? Let's think. σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is off-diagonal. Its matrix representation is [[0,1],[1,0]]. The expectation value of σx is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

Alternatively, I can express this as the sum over the components. Wait, another approach: for a spin-½ particle in a state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b) / (|a|^2 + |b|^2) ? Wait no, that's maybe not correct. Or perhaps I should compute it using the matrix approach.

Let me write out the state vector as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is
