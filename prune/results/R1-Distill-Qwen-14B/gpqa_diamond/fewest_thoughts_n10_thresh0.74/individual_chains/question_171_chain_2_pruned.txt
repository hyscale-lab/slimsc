Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, the question is asking me to arrange six substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer after undergoing the reaction. Right, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, directing groups on the benzene ring influence where the substituents add—ortho, meta, or para.

So each of these compounds is a benzene ring with a different substituent. The substituents are:

1) С6H5-CH3: That's toluene, so the substituent is a methyl group.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That looks like an ethyl ester group, so the substituent is OCOCH2CH3.
3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine substituent.
4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group.
5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethyl group, so substituent is -C2H5.
6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group, -COOH.

Wait, wait, the reaction is with excess bromine, so it's a bromination via electrophilic substitution. Each substituent will direct the incoming Br+ to certain positions.

I think the activating or deactivating nature of the substituent affects the reactivity and the positions where substitution occurs. Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2, -R where R is alkyl) are electron-donating, making the ring more reactive and directing incoming groups to ortho and para positions. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -X where X is halogen) are electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive and directing to meta positions.

Wait, but wait, each substituent's directing effect depends on whether it's activating or deactivating. Let's list each substituent:

1. Methyl (-CH3): Activating, because alkyl groups are electron-donating through sigma bonds. So it's an activating group, so directs to ortho and para. Since it's a strong activating group, the para substitution is likely major.

2. OCOCH2CH3: That's an ester group. The ester is an electron-withdrawing group because of the carbonyl. So it's deactivating. So it's a meta director.

3. Cl: Chlorine is a halogen. Halogens are deactivating (because of their electronegativity, but ortho-para directors because they can donate electrons through resonance when the lone pairs are available. Wait, so Cl is a deactivating but ortho/para director.

4. NO2: Nitro is a strong deactivating group, meta director.

5. C2H5: Ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para director.

6. COOH: Carboxylic acid group. That's a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing -COOH, which makes the ring less reactive. So it's a meta director.

Wait, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused about COOH.
