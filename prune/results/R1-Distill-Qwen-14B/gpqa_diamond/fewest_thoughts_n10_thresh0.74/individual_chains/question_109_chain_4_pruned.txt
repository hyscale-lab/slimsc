Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear physics and quantum mechanics. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try my best.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (like a deuteron) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. We need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

First, let me parse the given information. The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0: 2S+1 = 2*0 +1 =1, so S=0. L is S in the notation, which is 0, so the orbital angular momentum is 0. J is 0, so the total angular momentum is zero. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So, when the system emits X, the parity of the system changes, and we have to consider the conservation of parity.

Pauli's exclusion principle is involved here, particularly with the requirement that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, is that correct? Or is it that the sum of isospin, orbital angular momentum, and spin must be even? Let me think. Oh, wait, Pauli's exclusion principle for identical fermions states that their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The wavefunction consists of spin, spatial (including orbital angular momentum and isospin) parts. So each part must combine in a way that the total is antisymmetric.

But the problem gives the condition T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. Let's see: T is the isospin, which is a vector, but perhaps in this context, it's considering the third component or the magnitude mod 2? Or maybe it's about the parity of the isospin. Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the product of these quantum numbers (mod 2) must sum to 0 or 1. Wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So T equals (S + L +1) mod 2.

Wait, the problem states: "Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)."

Wait, I think I might have that wrong. Let me recheck. Oh, the question says, "the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2)." So T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Hmm, but I'm a bit shaky on how that formula comes about. But perhaps I can proceed using the given condition.

The final NN state has T(NN)
