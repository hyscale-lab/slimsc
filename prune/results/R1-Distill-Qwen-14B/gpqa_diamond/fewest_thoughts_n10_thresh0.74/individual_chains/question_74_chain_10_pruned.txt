Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out. Let me see what I remember from my classes. Hmm, radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time, and that probability doesn't depend on how much time has already passed.

Wait, the question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, that's like the chance it'll decay in the first 100 minutes after it's created. Now, they've observed this atom for 50 minutes and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean the next 150 minutes from now, or the next 150 after the initial 100? I think it's the next 150 after the 50 minutes have passed, so total of 200 minutes since the start?

Wait no, let me read the question again. So the atom was obtained and monitoring started right away. So time zero is when the atom was created. They've been monitoring for 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now we want to find the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes, which would be from time 50 to 200 minutes. So the total time since start is 200 minutes, but the question is about the next 150 minutes after the 50-minute mark.

But wait, in radioactive decay
