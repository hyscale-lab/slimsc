Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So, wait, aromatic rings usually have 6 carbons. If it's di-substituted, that means two substituents on the ring. But the total is 8 carbons. Hmm, so 6 from the ring, plus two substituents that have a total of 2 carbons each, or maybe one substituent has 2 and the other has 0? No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. The ring itself is 6 carbons. So the substituents must add up to 2 carbons, because 6 + 2 =8 total. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the total is 8 carbons in the compound. So the ring is 6 carbons, substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is a group with one carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? No, since it's di-substituted, both substituents must be present.

Wait, each substituent is a group attached to the ring. So if the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2, perhaps each substituent is a methyl group (each has 1 C), but that would make 6 + 2 =8. Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group (like ketone) which is O=C-, but that's zero carbons. Wait, no, a carbonyl is a functional group, but the substituent would be something like a carbonyl attached. Wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, which is part of a carbonyl compound, like an acetyl group.

But wait, the question says that the FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-Br, C-Cl, etc.). So the substituents on the ring must include a carbonyl group and a halogen atom.

Wait, but a substituent could be a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.), which is a single
