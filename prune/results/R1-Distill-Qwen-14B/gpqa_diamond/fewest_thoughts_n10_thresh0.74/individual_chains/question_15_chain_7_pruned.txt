Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and the chances of their transiting. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Researchers want to observe which one has a higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known.

Wait, both have the same mass? Oh, right, that's given. So their masses are equal. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period usually means a closer orbit, assuming similar stars.

The stars hosting them have different masses. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, wait, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius as Planet_1's. Interesting.

So the question is about transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the planet's orbital distance. The formula I think is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something about the orbital distance). Or wait, maybe it's the distance between the planet and the star, or the semi-major axis.

Wait, the transit probability formula. I think the geometric probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so it's approximately R_star / a. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

I remember the probability P is given by (R_s + R_p) / a, but R_p is negligible compared to R_s, so it's roughly R_s / a. Hmm, but wait, no, isn't it R_s/(a (1 + sqrt( (M_star)/(M_planet) )) )? No, that's for the transit duration, maybe. Alternatively, wait, the transit probability is proportional to (R_s + R_p) / (a (1 + sqrt( ... )) )? I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

Wait, I think the transit probability formula for a planet is given by (R_s + R_p) / (a * (1 + sqrt( (M_s)/(M_p) )) ), but since M
