Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ measured from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Hmm. I remember that when a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the source. Since this is a spheroidal distribution symmetric about the z-axis, I think the radiation will have certain angular dependencies.

Wait, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a function of cosθ. The power radiated in a particular direction depends on the square of sinθ or something like that. Oh right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to (sin^2θ), but for higher multipoles, it's different. But wait, the maximum power is along the equator (θ=90 degrees) for a dipole. No wait, no, wait. Wait, the dipole's radiation is maximum at θ=90 degrees, right? Because the dipole's radiation is strongest perpendicular to its axis. Wait, no, I think for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is such that the intensity is proportional to (sin^2θ), which is maximum at θ=90 degrees, so equator is the strongest. So if the maximum is at θ=90, then at θ=30, the intensity would be lower.

But wait, the problem is asking about a spheroidal distribution. Wait, maybe it's a quadrupole or something else? Or perhaps it's a general oscillating spheroid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dipole.

Wait, another approach: the problem says the power per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A. So when θ is such that f
