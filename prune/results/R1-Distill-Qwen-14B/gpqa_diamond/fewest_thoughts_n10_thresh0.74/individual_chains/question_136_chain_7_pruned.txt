Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me think. The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, what's the divergence of a vector field? Oh right, divergence measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. So I need to calculate ∇ · f and then integrate that over the volume of the sphere.

The field f(r) is radial, meaning it points directly away from or towards the origin, depending on the sign. Since the magnitude is 1/r², f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, where r̂ is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates.

I remember the formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ sinφ)) dA_φ/dφ]. But in this case, the vector field has only the radial component, so A_θ and A_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² A_r)/dr.

Let me plug in A_r. Since A_r is the radial component, which is 1/r². So A_r = 1/r². Then, r² A_r = r² * (1/r²)
