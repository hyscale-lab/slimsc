Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The problem says that there are two stars with exactly the same masses, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

The key data points are the shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift caused by the star moving due to the planet's gravity. The semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period and distance. 

The formula I recall is something like K = (v) which is proportional to (M sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) (P^(−1/3)) ), but wait, maybe it's more precise to write it as:

K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) ) / (c * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. I remember the formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's (Neptune is much less than Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So, K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet ) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is remembering that for a given planet mass and star mass, the velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because K is proportional to (M_p / (M_s * (1 + M_p/M_s)^(2/3)) ) ) * (P)^(-1/3) ), approximately. Since M_p is much less than M_s, it simplifies to K ≈ (M_p / M_s^(2/3)) ) * (P)^(-1/3). 

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula I have is K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3 ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p )^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_s, it's approximately K ≈ (G / (2π c^3))^(1/3) * (M_p / M_s^(2/3)) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_s^(2/3)) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but in this
