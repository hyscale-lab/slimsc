Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, which are atoms (usually carbon) bonded to four different groups. This makes them non-superimposable on their mirror image, leading to enantiomers.

Let's look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism, especially if there's a possibility of the substituents being on different sides. Wait, but biphenyls themselves can have geometric isomerism if the substituents are in a certain way. Oh, but this compound has the same substituents on each phenyl ring? No, wait, it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So on each ring, the nitro is at position 6 and the carboxylate at position 2. Wait, but the rings are connected at 1 and 1', so the substituents are in positions that are across from each other. So could there be a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in symmetrical positions, maybe there's no chirality. Or wait, maybe the biphenyl can have a twist, leading to cis or trans isomerism. But optical isomerism is about chirality. So biphenyls can have E and Z isomerism, which is geometric (stereoisomerism without chiral centers). Wait, but that's not optical isomerism; that's geometric isomerism, which is a type of stereoisomerism but not optical. Wait, optical isomerism is a subset of stereoisomerism where the compounds are chiral and can rotate plane-polarized light. So if a compound has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, I don't see any chiral centers. The biphenyl is connected at position 1 and 1', and the substituents are in 2 and 6 positions. So each substituent is on a different ring, but are the carbons where they attach chiral? Let me see. The central carbon where the two rings are connected? Wait, no, in a bip
