Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics and how some of its properties change when it has dark spots on its surface. The main focus is on the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The options given are about the factor by which this ratio changes.

First, let me parse the given information. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star cooler on average.

They're talking about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. Wait, so when there are spots, the ratio is lower. I need to find by what factor this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when there are no spots divided by the ratio when there are spots.

Hmm. Oh wait, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, the ratio without spots (let's say R_no) is higher than with spots (R_with). So, the factor is R_no / R_with.

But I'm not exactly sure how to model this. I remember something about the Boltzmann equation in stellar atmospheres. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the population of atoms in different energy levels under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which the problem states applies here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels as:

n2 / n1 = (g2 / g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in energy levels 2 and 1, respectively.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) for each level.
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

The ratio the astronomers are looking at is n1/n2, I think. Wait, wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. So it's (n1 / n2). The question states that this ratio decreases when spots are present. So, when the spots are present, the temperature is lower, and the ratio is smaller. That makes sense because lower temperatures would lead to more atoms being in the lower energy state.

Wait, let's think about it. The energy difference between the two levels is fixed because it's a specific transition (wavelength 1448 Å). So, the energy difference Δ
