Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and then breaking it down.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. We need to find two things: the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume.

First, I think I need to determine how much Fe(OH)3 is present and then figure out how much acid is needed to dissolve it completely. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so when it reacts with a strong acid, it should produce Fe³+ ions and water. 

Let me jot down the formula for Fe(OH)3. Its molar mass will be needed. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3, it's Fe + 3(OH) groups. So:

Fe: 55.85 g/mol
3 O: 3 * 16 = 48 g/mol
3 H: 3 * 1 = 3 g/mol
Total molar mass = 55.85 + 48 + 3 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, wait. Actually, Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, so each OH is 17 g/mol. So three OH's would be 3 * 17 = 51. So maybe I should calculate it correctly. Let me recalculate:

Fe: ~55.85 g/mol
Each OH group: 16 + 1 = 17 g/mol.
So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So that part was correct.

The mass given is 0.1 grams. So the number of moles is mass divided by molar mass. Moles = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol, or 9.36e-4 mol.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid like HCl, the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole of acid provides one mole of H+.

So for 9.36e-4 moles of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles of H+.

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter or 0.1 moles per 1000 cm³. So volume (in liters) needed is moles / concentration.

Volume (L) = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, wait, but wait... the question says "minimum volume" so perhaps this is the exact volume needed. But wait, what about the total volume of the solution being 100 cm³? Oh, wait, the total solution volume is 100 cm³, but the initial volume before adding the acid is not specified. Hmm, wait. Oh, I think I need to consider that the acid is being added to the solution. So the total volume after adding the acid will be 100 cm³? Or do I just add the acid to the solution, which initially has 100 cm³ including the dissolved Fe(OH)3 and any water? Hmm, this might complicate things. Wait, the problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³, but I think that's the total after adding the acid. Or perhaps that the solution has a total volume of 100 cm³, but it doesn't specify whether the acid is added to that. Hmm, maybe I should proceed assuming that the 28.08 cm³ is the volume of acid needed, and the total volume is 100 cm³. 

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the solution has a total volume of 100 cm³. So if I add, say, 2
