Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices, and I'm trying to figure out where it's located in the qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, this looks like a diagonal matrix. Diagonal matrices usually indicate something about the basis states.

Oh right! When the density matrix is diagonal, it often represents a classical mixture of the basis states. Because here, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2 each. That means the qubit is in a completely mixed state, right? So it's a 50% chance of being in |0⟩ and 50% in |1⟩.

Wait, but how does that translate to the Bloch sphere representation? I remember that pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, and mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector is represented as (x,y,z), where each component corresponds to a basis in the Pauli matrices. The state is written as (x, y, z) where x = ⟨σx⟩, y = ⟨σy⟩, z = ⟨σz⟩.

So for a pure state |0⟩, the Bloch vector is (0,0,1) because it's along the z-axis. Similarly, |1⟩ is (0,0,-1). But wait, in our case, the state is a mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩, each with probability 1/2. So the expectation values would be the average of their respective expectations.

Let me compute each expectation. For σz, |0⟩ has expectation +1, |1⟩ has -1. So averaging 1/2 * (+1) + 1/2 * (-1) gives 0. Similarly, σx and σy: for |0⟩, ⟨σx⟩ is 0, ⟨σy⟩ is 0. Same for |1⟩. So all the components x, y, z are zero. That would place the state at the origin in the Bloch sphere.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, that's option C. The other options don't make sense. Option B is (0,0,1), which is |0⟩, but this is a mixed state. Option D is all ones, which I don't think is possible. Option A is (1,1,0), which might be some pure state, but here we're in the center.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a mixed state where the qubit has a 50% probability of being in the state \(|0\rangle\) and a 50% probability of being in the state \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are located on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside the sphere. 

For the given density matrix, the Bloch vector components are determined by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), and \(\sigma_z\). 

- For \(\sigma_z\), the expectation value is \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle = \frac{1}{2}(1) + \frac{1}{2}(-1) = 0\).
- For \(\sigma_x\) and \(\sigma_y\), the expectation values are \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0\) and \(\langle \sigma_y \rangle = 0\), since both \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\) have zero expectation values for these operators.

Thus, the Bloch vector is \((0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This confirms that the state is a completely mixed state and not a pure state. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** (\((1,1,0)\)) corresponds to a pure state, which is incorrect.
- **Option B** (\((0,0,1)\)) corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), which is incorrect.
- **Option C** (\((0,0,0)\)) corresponds to the origin, which is correct.
- **Option D** (\((1,1,1)\)) is not a valid state in the Bloch sphere.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
