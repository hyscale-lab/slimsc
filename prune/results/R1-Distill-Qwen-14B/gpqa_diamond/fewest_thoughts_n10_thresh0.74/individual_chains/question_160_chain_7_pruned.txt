Alright, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about diffraction. Let me read the question again carefully.

The setup is that there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis and falls vertically on this aperture. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and they mention that the angles are small, so we can use the approximation tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, okay. So, N is going to infinity, which probably means the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So, maybe this is a problem related to circular aperture diffraction.

Wait, but the polygon's apothems are all length 'a'. What's an apothem? Oh right, in a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius 'R' of the circumscribed circle (the radius from the center to a vertex). The formula for apothem is a = R * cos(π/N), I think. But since N is large, π/N becomes very small. So cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²). But for N approaching infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So, a ≈ R. Wait, no, actually when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' would be the radius, right? Or wait, no, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, and in a circle, that's the same as the radius. So maybe for infinitely large N, the apothem 'a' is equal to the radius R. So R = a.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, and the radius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle (the one that touches the vertices). So for a regular polygon, R = a / cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So yes, for a very large N, R is approximately equal to a. So the polygon becomes
