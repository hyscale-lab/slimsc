Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a good starting point. The molecular formula can sometimes give me hints about the structure. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation because that might help. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is9, N is1, O is1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2= 4.5. Wait, that can't be right because degrees of unsaturation should be an integer. Did I do the math right? Let me recalculate:

Wait, the formula is DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0 since it's not present, so:

(2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (16+2-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. Oh wait, no, 16+2 is 18, minus 9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So DoU is 5. So that's five degrees of unsaturation. Which can be from rings and double bonds. Each ring or double bond contributes 1, each triple bond contributes 2, etc.

So 5 DoU could be: maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU from three double bonds) and then two more, perhaps a double bond and a ring? Or one double bond and a carbonyl. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows these signals:
- 9.72 ppm, triplet, 1H. That's a high chemical shift, maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, aldehyde protons usually don't have neighboring hydrogens because they're at the end. Hmm, unless it's an enal or something where the aldehyde is adjacent to a double bond. So maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system.

Next, 6.98 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet for two protons. So maybe para-substituted aromatic protons. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons are equivalent and each is a doublet due to coupling with the two adjacent protons (but wait, in para substitution, each proton is meta to the substituent and para to the other, but the coupling is actually with the two adjacent in the ring, which are ortho. So maybe the substituent is in para position, and the protons adjacent are ortho. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet due to coupling with another set of protons, like in a coupling between two aromatic rings
