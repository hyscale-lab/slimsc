Okay, so I have this genetics problem about plant disease resistance and gene interactions. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

So the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their knockout mutants. They're testing these in a high-throughput experiment to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease in white lupine. The results show varying levels of resistance in the mutants and their double mutants.

The data given are the resistance percentages compared to the wild-type control, which is 100%. Let me list them out:

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low resistance)
- g2g3: 0% (no resistance)
- g1g2: 0% (no resistance)

I remember that in genetics, when you have epistatic interactions, the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that might indicate epistasis. Also, if a gene is a transcription factor upstream, it's probably regulating others, so knocking it out would affect downstream genes more severely.

Wait, since at least one is a transcription factor upstream, that means one of these genes is regulating the others. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes can't be expressed, leading to more severe phenotypes.

Looking at the data, the single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. That's really bad. So knocking out G2 makes the plant completely susceptible. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's regulating other genes which contribute to resistance. So without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, which explains why the resistance is so low.

In the double mutants:

g1g2 is 0% â€” same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because the presence of G1's knockout didn't change the phenotype beyond what G2's knockout already caused. So G2 is downstream of G1, perhaps? Or G2 is the regulatory gene.

Wait, another way: in epistasis, if you have two mutations, the one that is epistatic is the one whose mutation masks the effect of the other. So for example, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then a mutation in A would determine the phenotype regardless of B's state. So in the double mutant A B, the phenotype is the same as a single mutant A. That's what's happening here: in g1g2, the phenotype is 0% like g2, so G2 is epistatic to G1. So G2 is downstream of G1.

Wait, but if G2 is epistatic, that usually means it's downstream. Because the downstream gene's function determines the outcome
