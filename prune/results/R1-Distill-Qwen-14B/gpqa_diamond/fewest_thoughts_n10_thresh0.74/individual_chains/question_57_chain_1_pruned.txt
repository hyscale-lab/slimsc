Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, especially in the context of partial waves and the Born approximation, the scattering amplitude can be expressed in terms of phase shifts.

Wait, phase shifts. Right, each partial wave is characterized by a phase shift δ_l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. The scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written as a sum over these partial waves. The general formula I think is f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{2iδ_l} sinδ_l ) / ( (1 - e^{2iδ_l}) ) ) * something... Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the scattering amplitude in the partial wave expansion is given by f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) / (something else?).

Wait no, the formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) / ( ... ) No, wait, I might be getting confused. Oh wait, the exact formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts is f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) * e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) / ( (something) )... Hmm, maybe I should think about the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. And in the context of the problem, since the question asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0. So I'm to compute Im(f(0)).

I recall that in the partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude's imaginary part at θ=0 is given by (1/(2k)) times the sum over l of (2l + 1) * sin δ_l. Because at θ=0, the exponential terms simplify, and some terms might drop out.

Wait, let me think again. The general expression for f (θ, φ) is: f = (1/k) * Σ [(2l + 1) * e^{iδ_l} ( sin δ_l ) ] * P_l(cos θ) e^{i l φ}.

Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [(2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) / (something) ) ] ... Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to write it correctly.

The scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} ( e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ) ) ... no, wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ) * P_l(cosθ) e^{i l φ} ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But for the imaginary part along the beam direction, which is θ=0.

Wait, when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(x)=1, P_1= x, etc., but when x=1, all Pl(1)=1. So for θ=0, the amplitude simplifies. Also, since the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond the given ones, but in this question, we are given phase shifts δ_0=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13 degrees. So l ranges from 0 to 4.

Now, the formula for the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ). Because when θ=0, the Legendre polynomial Pl(1)=1, and the exponential with lφ becomes e^{i l * 0} =1.

So f(0) is (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^{4} (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

But I'm to find the imaginary part of f(0). So let's compute Im(f(0)).

Let me compute each term for l=0 to 4.

First, let's compute each (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

Because e^{iδ} = cosδ + i sinδ. So e^{iδ} sinδ = (cosδ + i sinδ) sinδ = sinδ cosδ + i sin²δ.

So when we take each term (2l+1) multiplied by ( sinδ cosδ + i sin²δ ), the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin²δ.

So the imaginary part of the entire sum is sum (2l+1) sin²δ_l.

Then, Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) * sum ( (2l +1) sin^2 δ_l )

Wait, because f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ sum terms ].

So the imaginary part is [1/(2k)] times the sum of (2l +1) sin² δ_l, multiplied by i, but wait, no, let me make this more precise.

Wait, f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * sum [ (2l+1) ( sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sin² δ_l ) ]

So f(0) can be written as (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l + i sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ) ]

Which can be expressed as [sum (2l+1) sin δ_l cos δ_l ]/(2ik) ) + [sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2k) )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]/(2k) ), because [sum ... ]/(2ik) is a term with 1/i = -i, so it would contribute to the imaginary part, but wait, perhaps I'm getting the signs wrong.

Wait, let me do the expansion correctly.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) [ cosδ_l + i sinδ_l ] sinδ_l.

Which is (2l+1) [ cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

So the sum is sum [ (2l+1) ( cosδ_l sinδ_l ) ] + i sum [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ]
