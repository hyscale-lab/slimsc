Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction. I remember that [4+2] cycloadditions are part of the Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4π + 2π] electron process. But wait, wait, no, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. But wait, the question is about an exo product. Hmm, so I need to think about the endo rule or the exo factor here.

The reactants given are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. So, what's the structure of each?

2,5-dimethylthiophene: Thiophene is a five-membered ring with one sulfur. The 2 and 5 positions have methyl groups. So positions 1, 2 (CH3), 3, 4, and 5 (CH3). Wait, no, wait: in a thiophene ring, the numbering is such that the sulfur is at position 1, then positions 2 and 5 are adjacent to it. So 2,5-dimethyl would have methyl groups on carbons 2 and 5.

Furan-2,5-dione: Furan is a five-membered ring with oxygen. Furan-2,5-dione would have ketone groups at positions 2 and 5
