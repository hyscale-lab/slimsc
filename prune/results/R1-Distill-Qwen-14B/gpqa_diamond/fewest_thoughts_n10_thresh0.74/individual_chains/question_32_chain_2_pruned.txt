Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think Li has 3 protons because the atomic number is 3. Wait, no, wait, the question says it's Li with 3 neutrons. So the isotope must be Li-6 because Li normally has 3 protons, so 3 +3 neutrons would be mass number 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The problem is about relativistic speeds because 0.96c is pretty close to the speed of light. So I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just (1/2)mv² as in classical mechanics. Instead, we use the relativistic energy equation. 

The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is calculated as 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is given as 0.96c, I can plug that into the equation.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
2. Find the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

So first, calculating gamma. Let me compute 1 - (v²/c²). v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me check that calculation again. Because 0.28 times 0.28 is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is about 3.5714. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the numbers. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of approximately 1.0
