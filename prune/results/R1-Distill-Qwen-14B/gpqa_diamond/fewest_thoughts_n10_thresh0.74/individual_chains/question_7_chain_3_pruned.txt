Okay, so I've got this physics problem about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons. The reaction given is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. I remember that this process is significant because it can limit how many high-energy photons are around, which affects their observed flux or lifetime.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. I think the CMB is a blackbody radiation with a peak in the microwave region, so each photon has low energy, but there are a lot of them.

I recall that the annihilation cross-section for two photons into electron-positron pairs depends on the energy of the photons. When the center-of-mass (CM) energy is above the electron mass, which is about 0.511 MeV, the reaction can happen. But for high-energy photons, the cross-section has a specific behavior.

Wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by something proportional to (s)/(m_e^4), where s is the square of the CM energy. Oh right, for s >> m_e^2 (i.e., high-energy photons), the cross-section σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / (s)), where α is the fine-structure constant. So as s increases, σ decreases.

But how does this relate to the lifetime of the gamma-rays? Gamma-rays are moving through the universe, and their lifetime is determined by the probability of interacting with CMB photons. The mean free time τ is the inverse of the interaction rate Γ. The interaction rate is given by Γ = n_γ * σ * v, where n_γ is the number density of CMB photons, and v is the relative velocity.

Wait, but for photons, the velocity is the speed of light, so v ≈ c. So Γ ≈ n_γ * σ * c.

The lifetime τ is then τ ≈ 1/Γ = 1/(n_γ σ c). So the lifetime is limited when τ becomes comparable to the age of the universe. But the question is about the energy where this happens. So we need to find the gamma-ray energy E where the interaction time τ equals the age of the universe, T_universe.

But wait, I think the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years, but I need to get it into seconds for SI units. Let me compute that quickly: 1 year ≈ 3.154e7 seconds, so 13.8e9 years is 13.8e9 * 3.154e7 ≈ 4.35e17 seconds.

Alternatively, I remember that 1 second is about 3e8 meters (c), so maybe the calculation will use the age in terms compatible with the units.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering the optical depth. Optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section, the number density of targets, and the path length. For τ ≈ 1, the probability of interaction is about 1/3, and
