Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are run on different HPLC columns, and we need to see what the chromatograms show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation typically occurs in alkenes, forming an epoxide. So, when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it adds an oxygen to form an epoxide. 

But wait, the stereochemistry might matter here. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. So, each will form a different epoxide, right?

Let me think about the epoxidation process. For alkenes, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a conjugated manner, forming an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific. The peracid approaches from the same face, leading to the formation of the epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, but what's the outcome for each isomer? Let's consider (E)-oct-4-ene first. The (E) configuration has the two higher priority groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it will form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, no, maybe it's more about the endo transition state. Oh right, the epoxidation proceeds with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So, if the starting alkene is trans (E), the epoxide will have the oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans epoxide? Or wait, maybe I should draw this.

Wait, no, when mCPBA adds to an alkene, the peracid's oxygen comes from the same face. So, for a trans (E) alkene, the addition would lead to an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms are on opposite sides, making the epoxide trans as well. Or wait, perhaps I'm getting this confused.

Wait, let me think again. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents (the methyl groups, perhaps) are
