Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's look at each reaction one by one.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm. I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide usually form cyanohydrins. So, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, it's a nucleophilic addition. The mechanism involves the cyanide ion adding to the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen becomes an -OH group after work-up.

Wait, but the product here is a cyanohydrin. So the reaction of a ketone with CN- produces a cyanohydrin. But what's the role of the reagent A? I think the work-up after the addition. So after the nucleophilic addition, you typically acidify the solution to protonate the oxygen. So A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is HCl or H2SO4 maybe) or maybe something else.

The second reaction is a bit trickier. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's treated with reagent B and water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So, looking at the product, the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). 

How does that happen? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. There are two main ways to hydrolyze nitriles: one is under acidic conditions, and the other under basic conditions. But wait, in this case, the starting material already has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the same carbon as the nitrile. So, when you hydrolyze the nitrile, you need to make sure that the conditions don't cause any other reactions, like removing the hydroxyl group or something.

Wait, but the product has both the hydroxyl and the carboxylic acid. So the hydroxyl is still present. So the hydrolysis of the nitrile must occur without affecting the existing hydroxyl group. 

Hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. Let's think. Under acidic conditions (like HCl or H2SO4), the nitrile can be hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions (like NaOH), it might form a carboxylate salt, which can then be acidified.

But in this case, the product is the carboxylic acid, so the work-up must involve acid. Wait, but the reagent B is applied along with H2O. So, perhaps reagent B is something that helps in the hydrolysis. Maybe it's a strong acid like HCl.

So putting it together:

First reaction: NaCN adds to the ketone
