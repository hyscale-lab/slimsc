Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. They used the radial velocity (RV) method to detect them. RV detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity.

So the key data here is the periodic wavelength shifts. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but how does that translate into orbital periods?

I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star. The Doppler shift is related to the star's velocity. The formula for velocity using Doppler shift is something like v = (lambda_observed - lambda_rest) / lambda_rest * c, but I'm not sure if I need the exact formula here.

Wait, but the RV method gives the velocity amplitude of the star, which is related to the planet's mass and the orbit. The formula for the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1 / (2π)) )

But wait, since the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like) and the stars are solar mass, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies to something else. Let me think.

Actually, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (2π)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Another approach: There's a formula that relates the RV semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P, the mass of the planet M_p, and the mass of the star M_*. 

The formula is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (8 * c^3) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2)) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is inversely related to the orbital period. Oh wait, no, not exactly. Let's think about the
