Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. Hmm, let me break it down.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A is the product of a reaction involving BuLi and then H+. Part B is the product of heating a more complex molecule. I need to figure out what each product is and then match them to the options.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that structure. So it's a benzene ring with a substituent that's an OCH2 group. The O is attached to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)- something. Wait, but the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)? No, wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a methyl on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe better to number the chain.

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 3-methyl would mean a methyl on the third carbon, which is the CH2 group. So it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)-. Wait, but that can't be right because but has four carbons. Let me see: 1 is the starting point. So the but-2-en-1-yl group is: position 1 is the first carbon (CH2), position 2 is double bond (CH), position 3 is CH2, position 4 is CH3? No, wait. Wait but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait but that's four carbons. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2- (but wait, but-2-en-1-yl would have four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So position 1
