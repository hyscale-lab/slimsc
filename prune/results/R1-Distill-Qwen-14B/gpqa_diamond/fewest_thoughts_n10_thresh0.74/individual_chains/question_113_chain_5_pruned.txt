Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by going through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretching. So this could be an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, I should remember that a very broad peak might suggest a lot of hydrogen bonding, which is more characteristic of an alcohol. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is also broad. Hmm, but I think that for a carboxylic acid, the peak is around 2500-3300 and is very broad. So maybe that's possible. 

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an ester or conjugated carbonyl, or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a conjugated carbonyl system. Alternatively, it could be a C=O stretch from something else. Wait, maybe it's an amide? No, but the options don't have nitrogen. Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone. That might lower the wavenumber a bit.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum has peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe as part of a conjugated system or an isolated double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I should think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments could be (CH3)2O, which is 45. Or maybe a CH2O group? Wait, (CH3)2O is 45, yes, because that's (12*2 + 1*6 + 16) = 24 +6 +16=46? Wait, wait. Let me calculate. (CH3)2O is 2*(12 +3*1) +16 → 2*(15) +16=30+16=46. Oh, wait, that's 46. So m/z 45 might not be that. Maybe another fragment. What else gives 45?

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group? No, that wouldn't make sense. Or maybe a ketene ion? Or maybe something like a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has an ethyl group and some other functionality.

Wait, perhaps it's a fragment with a carbonyl group. Let me think. 45 is the mass. Let's think about possible structures. For example, the fragment could be CH2O, which is formaldehyde? But that's 30. Or maybe CH3CHO (acetaldehyde), but its mass is 44. Wait, m/z 44 is acetaldehyde (CH3CHO has a molecular weight of 44). Or perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O- something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from an ester. For example, if the compound is an ester like methyl propionate or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. Hmm.

Now, looking at the possible options, the formulas are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So let's think about each. Let's start by considering the functional groups.

FTIR: the broad peak at ~3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an
