Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question involves two reactions, both of which involve the reduction of ketones using LAH and NaBH4. Then, after isolating the products, they're combined and analyzed using HPLC. The main thing I need to figure out is how many peaks each HPLC will show.

First, I'll break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. When LAH reduces it, the ketone group (the C=O at position 3) will become a CHOH group. So the product should be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait—the configuration. Since the starting material is an S configuration, what happens upon reduction? LAH is a strong reducing agent that generally doesn't change the configuration because it's a hydride reduction, which is a stereospecific process. Wait, no—wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the new hydroxyl group's configuration depends on the starting material's structure. The starting material is (S) configuration at C5, but the ketone is at C3. So when C3 is reduced, the configuration at C3 would be determined by the approach of the hydride. Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) at C5, not C3. So the C3 is a carbonyl, so it's a trigonal planar. When LAH adds, it's a hydride attack from one face. The resulting alcohol will have the hydroxyl group on the same face that the hydride came from. Wait, but LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically gives the R configuration when adding to a ketone. Or no, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because for a ketone like acetone, when you reduce it with LAH, you get a secondary alcohol where the hydroxyl is on the same side as the existing groups. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, the configuration depends on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry at C3 is determined during the reduction, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product will have a certain configuration.

Wait, no. Wait. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the molecule is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me correct that. Hexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH
