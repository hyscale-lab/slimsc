Okay, so I'm trying to solve this molecular biology question. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is being overexpressed. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They modified the gene to add a hemagglutinin sequence at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine, and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But they can't overexpress the protein as expected. The problem is found in the plasmid's plus strand sequence.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out what's wrong with the construct.

The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand. Let's look for any issues in the coding sequence.

First, I'll check the reading frame. The start codon is at the beginning. The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, so that's correct for the start. 

Wait, the added sequence is a single influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. So the GADD45G coding sequence should follow that. But looking at the given sequence... Hmm, does the hemagglutinin (HA) tag have any issues?

HA is typically a small peptide, maybe around 10 amino acids. Let me check the initial part of the sequence to see if the HA tag is correctly included.

Wait, the HA tag's DNA sequence is after the start codon. Let me think about the HA epitope. The HA tag is usually from the influenza virus and is about 11 amino acids long, something like YPYDVPDYA. But let's not get too stuck on that. The problem is more about the DNA construct's issues.

Looking at the given DNA sequence, the start is ATG, then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), etc. Wait a minute, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, meaning it should be the first part of the coding sequence. So the first few codons should be the HA tag.

Wait, the initial part of the DNA sequence after ATG is TAC (Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then CGA
