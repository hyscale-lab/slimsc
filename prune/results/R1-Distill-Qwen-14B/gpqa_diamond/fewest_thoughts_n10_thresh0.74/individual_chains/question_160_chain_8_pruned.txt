Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of wave optics and diffraction patterns. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a light aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field where intensity maxima and minima occur. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can use the small angle approximation where tan(theta) ≈ theta.

Hmm, right. So first, I remember that when dealing with diffraction from an aperture, the pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles determined by the slit width. But this is a polygon, and when N is infinitely large, it's almost like a circular aperture. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when N approaches infinity, a regular polygon approaches a circle. Oh, but the question is about the minima, so maybe it's similar to a circular aperture's diffraction pattern.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the apothems are all of the same length 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a' because the apothem in a regular polygon (as N increases) becomes the radius of the circumscribed circle. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, which for a regular polygon is the same as the radius of the inscribed circle. As N increases, the inscribed and circumscribed circles converge. So in the limit, the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a'.

So if the aperture is a circle, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk. The minima in the intensity occur at angles given by the condition a sin(theta) = m λ, where m is an integer (m = ±1, ±2, ...). The first minima (m=1) would be at theta = λ/(a), but wait, wait, because lambda over a, but wait, in the small angle approximation, sin(theta) ≈ theta, so theta ≈ m λ / a.

Wait, but in
