Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Hmm, let's see. The question says the aperture is shaped like a N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, the angles are small, so we can use tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with diffraction, the pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the minima occur at angles given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer, and a is the slit width. But this isn't a single slit; it's a polygon with many sides. Oh, but the problem says N is infinitely large. So maybe it approximates a circular aperture?

Wait, wait, no. Wait a minute. A polygon with infinite sides would be a circle. Oh, but wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the side length and the number of sides. But if N is very large, the shape becomes a circle, but perhaps the effective width is determined by the apothem?

No, wait. Wait, for a regular polygon, the radius (distance from center to a vertex) is R, and the apothem is a. The relationship between R and a for a regular polygon is a = R * cos(π/N). But if N is very large, then π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²). But as N approaches infinity, a approaches R. Hmm, but maybe in this case, when N is large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius a, because the apothem is the same as the radius for a circle.

Wait, no. For a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So maybe when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. But wait, the problem says all apothems are the same length a. So each side is at a distance a from the center.

Wait, but in the case of a circle, the entire perimeter is at a distance 'a' from the center. So perhaps the polygon with N sides, all apothems a, when N is large, behaves like a circle of radius a.

But wait, when you have a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk, with the first minimum at θ ≈ 1.22 λ / a. That's one of the options here, option C. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, in the single slit case, the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = λ. Wait, no, wait. No, for single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, m = ±1, ±2, etc. So the first minima (m=1) is at θ where sinθ = λ/a, but when the angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/a. Wait, but in the case of a circular aperture, the minima are different.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up between single slit and circular apertures. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says the apertures are polygons with all apothems a. When N is very large, the polygon approximates a circle with radius a. Because the apothem (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) is a for each side. So as N increases, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

Wait, but wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a polygon with N sides and apothem a, the radius (distance from center to a vertex) R is R = a / cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So the polygon's vertices are at a distance a from the center
