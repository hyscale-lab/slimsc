Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

Alright, the setup is: an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then, a positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, both annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. Okay, so first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since an electron and a positron are involved, which are matter and antimatter, they can annihilate into energy, in this case, photons. But since they are moving, we have to consider conservation of momentum and energy.

Wait, but the problem says both electrons and positrons have Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor is gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2.

Wait, but the positron is a particle with the same mass as the electron but opposite charge. So in terms of momentum, since momentum is gamma*m*v, and velocity direction matters.

Let me think about the frame. Let's consider the lab frame. The electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from the left to the right along the horizontal axis). The positron is moving to the left (from the right, so to the left along the same axis). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait. The electron is moving from the left, so along the positive x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so along the negative x-direction. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Now, when they collide, annihilate into two photons. The photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So both photons are moving to the right, but one is angled up and the other down. Interesting.

Wait, but if both are moving in the upper and lower right, that's the same direction in the x-component, but their y-components are opposite. So the angle between them would be... Well, maybe we can find the angle based on momentum conservation.

Because
