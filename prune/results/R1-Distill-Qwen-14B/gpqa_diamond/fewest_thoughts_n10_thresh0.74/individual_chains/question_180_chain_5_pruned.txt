Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so maybe I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. The setup is a bit specific: 12 of them are constrained to stay 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So I'm thinking point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters.

Wait, but what exactly is the system? It's an isolated system, so energy is conserved, but I'm looking for the minimum energy. Hmm, but I think the question is about the electrostatic potential energy, since all the charges are fixed except the 13th, which is fixed too. Oh wait, no, the 13th is fixed at P, so all the other 12 are constrained at 2 meters from P. So all these 12 are at the same distance from the central charge.

So the system consists of 12 charges each at 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is. Each has a charge of 2e, so the central charge is 2e, and each surrounding is 2e as well. So the potential energy of
