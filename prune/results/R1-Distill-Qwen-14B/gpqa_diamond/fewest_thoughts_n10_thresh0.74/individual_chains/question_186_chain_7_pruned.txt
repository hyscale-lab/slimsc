Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the Cope rearrangement of a specific bicyclic compound. Hmm, let me remember what the Cope rearrangement entails.

From what I recall, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. The rearrangement leads to the formation of another 1,5-diene, but with a different structure. The reaction usually proceeds under thermal conditions, like heating, and it's a concerted process. Oh right, the Cope rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction, so maybe some orbital considerations come into play, but I'm not sure how crucial that is right now.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a seven-membered ring with two bridges. The numbering is a bit tricky. The bridgeheads are at positions 1,4, and 5, I think. Wait, the bicyclo[2.2.1] system has bridge lengths of two, two, and one. So the structure would have a bridge between 1 and 4, and another bridge between 5 and 2, or something like that? Maybe I should sketch it mentally.

So, the molecule is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, meaning there's a double bond at position 5. The substituents are at position 2: a vinyl group (so a CH2-CH2 maybe?) and an azabicyclo... wait, no. The substituent is 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo. So the nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a vinyl group (a double bond) attached to the same carbon. So the structure has a bridge with the nitrogen in one bridge, and a vinyl group in another position.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo is [2.2.1], which means the bridgehead atoms are positions 1, 4, and 5, I think. Let me imagine the structure: it's like norbornene, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, but in this case, the double bond is at position 5. Hmm, norbornene has a double bond between C2 and C3, I think. But this compound has the double bond between C5 and C6? Or another arrangement.

Wait, maybe I should number the bicyclo system. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has three bridgehead carbons: 1, 4, and 5. The numbering starts at one bridgehead, then goes around the bridge. So, for example, position 1 is connected via a two-carbon bridge to position 4, which is connected via another two-carbon bridge to position 5, which connects back to position 1 via a single
