Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is a pretty stable and rigid molecule. So dibrominated at the 1 and 3 positions.

Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The data given for product 1 includes the 1H NMR and IR spectra. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe elimination happened, forming a ketone. Because dibromide reacting with a base like KOH usually leads to elimination, especially if heated. 

Looking at the NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), that's a doublet maybe? That region is around where an alcohol or an ether would be, but with IR suggesting a carbonyl, perhaps it's an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxide protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl? Or perhaps the protons are next to the carbonyl, like in a ketone.

Wait, more likely, the product is an epoxide. Wait no, wait. Wait, the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If it's elimination, perhaps it forms an alkene? But that would produce an alkene, not a carbonyl. Oh, wait, another possibility: dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl. Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base, could undergo a double elimination, forming a ketone. For example, the base could abstract a hydrogen adjacent to each bromine, causing each Br to leave, and forming a double bond. Wait, but two Brs adjacent would eliminate, forming a double bond. But wait, adamantane's structure is such that 1 and 3 are maybe not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an
