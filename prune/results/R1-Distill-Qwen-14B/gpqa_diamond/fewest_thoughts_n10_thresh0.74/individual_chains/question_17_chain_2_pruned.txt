Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also gave me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects the calculation directly. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium in a 1:1 ratio. The complex formed is called a chelate, and the stability of this complex is given by the formation constant, K. A higher K means the complex is more stable.

So the problem is, we have a solution where calcium and EDTA form a complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

Wait, right, the formation constant (K) for the reaction Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- is given as 5e10. The K for this reaction is the equilibrium constant, which tells us about the extent to which the reaction proceeds to the right.

The reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA^2-; K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) 

So the formula is K = [Complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand.

In this case, the solution contains the complex at 0.02 M. But wait, what's the initial concentration of EDTA and calcium before complex formation? Oh, right, because the problem states it's a stoichiometric solution. So, I think that means the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- are in a 1:1 ratio. So, the solution has equal moles of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- before they form the complex. But wait, when the complex forms, each mole of Ca²+ binds with a mole of EDTA^4- to form a mole of complex. So, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations
