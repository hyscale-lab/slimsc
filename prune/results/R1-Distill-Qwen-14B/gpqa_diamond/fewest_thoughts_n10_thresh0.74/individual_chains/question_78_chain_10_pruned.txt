Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials. Let me think step by step.

The question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, d = r - s(tr), right? Because s(tr) is the position at time tr, the earlier time when the field was generated.

The velocity at the generating time tr is v. So, what's the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, where t>tr.

I remember that the scalar potential due to a moving charge isn't just the same as the static case. Oh wait, in the static case, V would be q/(4πε₀ r). But since the charge is moving, there's probably some correction involving the velocity.

Wait, the scalar potential for a moving charge is more complicated than that. I think it's given by something involving the velocity of the charge and the position vector. Oh right, the Liénard potentials! The scalar potential involves the velocity and the position of the charge. 

The general form I think is V = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / ( r - (v t_r) ) ] where t_r is the retarded time. But wait, in terms of the given variables, tr is the retarded time such that d = r - s(tr). So maybe the denominator becomes d plus something involving velocity?

Wait, the exact expression for V is something like q/(4πε₀) * [1/(d + (v tr)/c² ) ]? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, I think the denominator is d multiplied by c, minus the dot product of d and v, all over c squared. Wait, no, maybe something like (d c - v · d) divided by c squared?

Wait, no, let me think about the Liénard formula. The scalar potential is something like:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1 / ( |r - (s(tr) + v (t - tr)) )| ]

But since t > tr, and at time t, the charge is at s(t), but the field at r is due to the charge's position and velocity at tr. So, the distance from the charge's position at tr to the point r is d, right? So, the denominator in V would involve d, but also the velocity term. 

Wait, I think the denominator is (d c - v·d) / c, but wait, not exactly. Let me think again. The denominator term for V would involve (d c - v · d), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, the denominator could be (d c + v · d) or another combination.

Wait, in more precise terms, the denominator for V is (d c - v · d) divided by c squared? Or wait, is it (d c + (v · d))... No, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to logically deduce.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ γ (1 + (v · r')/c²) / |r' + (v/c²) (v · r')| ]

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, from what I remember, the scalar potential is:

V = [ q ] / [4π ε₀ (|d| c - (v · d) / c ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

V = q/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)) multiplied by some factor. Or perhaps (d c + v·d)?

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential is given by the static potential divided by (1 - (v · r')/(c² r')), where r' is the vector from the charge to the point. Or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the vector potential. The vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) multiplied by some term. The options suggest that A is proportional to v and V, which makes sense because A is related to the magnetic field, which arises due to moving charges.

Looking at the options, option C and D have different expressions for V and A.

Option C: V is (q c)/(4πε₀ (d c - v·d)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v·d)).

Option D: V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c + v·d)), and A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π (d c + v·d)).

Hmm, I need to figure out the correct denominator in V. Let's think about the denominator in V.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1/(r'), where r' is the distance from the charge at time tr to the point r. But because the charge is moving, the direct distance isn't just d. Instead, the actual path is such that the charge emits the field at tr, and from that point, the field travels to r. So, the displacement from the charge's position at tr to r is d. But because the charge was moving, the effective distance is modified by the velocity.

Wait, no. The potentials are functions that account for the retarded time. So, the scalar potential is:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) [ 1 / ( |d
