Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to consider each state, calculate E for it, then sum up the exponentials.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy depends on the products of the spins. Each term S_i S_j is +1 if the spins are the same and -1 if different. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 could have various values.

Wait, let me compute the possible values. Each product S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1. So the sum of the three products could be 3 (if all three are +1), 1 (if two +1 and one -1), -1 (two -1 and one +1), or -3 (if all three are -1).

Because E = -J (sum), so E = -J * (sum). So for each possible sum value, I can find E and the number of states that correspond to that sum.

Let me tabulate the possible sum values and their multiplicities.

Case 1: All three products are +1. So sum is 3. How many states have all three pairs as +1? That would mean all spins are the same. Because S1S2 = +1 implies S1=S2, same for S1S3 = +1 implies S1=S3. So all spins same. Since each spin is either +1 or -1, there are two such states: all +1 or all -1. So multiplicity is 2.

Case 2: Sum is 1. This happens when two products are +1 and one is -1. Let me think. For three products, how many ways can two be +1 and one -1. The number of ways is 3 choose 1 = 3. But I need to check if each of these corresponds to a possible state.

Wait, but each product is S_i S_j, so these are not independent. For example, S1S2=+1 and S1S3=+1 implies S2=S3. So if two products are +1, the third product must also be +1? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait no, let's take an example. Suppose S1=S2, S1=S3 (so S2=S3), then S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. Sum is 3. So that's case 1.

But what if two products are +1 and one is -1? Let's see. Let's say S1S2=+1, S1S3=+1, but S2S3=-1. That's impossible. Because if S1=S2 and S1=S3, then S2=S3, so S2S3=+1. Contradiction. So, maybe there's no state where exactly two products are +1 and one -1. Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier.

Wait another approach: Let's think about the possible states and calculate the sum.

Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3), each ±1.

Let me list them all:

1. (+1, +1, +1): each pair is +1. Sum = 3.
2. (+1, +1, -1): S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum = (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.
3. (+1, -1, +1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.
4. (+1, -1, -1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.
5. (-1, +1, +1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=+1. Sum: (-1) + (-1) + (+1) = -1.
6. (-1, +1, -1): S1S2=-1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (-1) + (+1) + (-1) = -1.
7. (-1, -1, +1): S1S2=+1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1.
8. (-1, -1, -1): each pair is +1. Sum = 3.

Wait, so looking at all 8 states:

- The first and last states have sum 3. So 2 states.
- The other 6 states have sum -1. Oh, so it's either 3 or -1.

Wait, that's different from what I thought
