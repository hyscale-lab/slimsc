Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember that elemental abundances are often measured using something called the equivalent width (EW) method, which relates to how much light a star emits at a certain wavelength. But wait, the question says to assume LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. I think that means the gas in the photosphere is in a state where the conditions are uniform enough to apply certain physical laws, like the Saha equation and the Boltzmann distribution for ionization and excitation. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the calculations here.

The question gives me the masses of two stars: Star_1 is 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 is 1.2 solar masses. But I don't think mass plays a direct role here since the problem is about elemental abundances, which are ratios of elements. So maybe I can ignore that part for now.

The abundances given are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, which is the logarithm of the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 relative to the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2. Also, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. Wait, [Fe/H] is metallicity, right? So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 means that the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun's. Same for [Mg/H]_2 = 0, so magnesium relative to hydrogen is solar.

Wait, but how do I tie this together to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres?

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. Let me calculate those. 

So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^(7.5 - 12) = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(7 - 12) = 10^-5 = 1e-5. Wait, but I'm not sure why it's 12 plus log(nX/nH). Oh, right, because these are the standard scales for element abundances. The number density of hydrogen is normalized such that log10(nH) is 12, so any element's number density is calculated relative to that.

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula is 12 + log(nX / nH) = some value, which I think comes from the fact that the number density of hydrogen is about 1e10 per cubic cm in the Sun's photosphere, so if you take the logarithm (base 10), log(nH) is about 10, but with some scaling, the 12 is a reference point. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I just need to use the given values to compute the ratios.

So for Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(Si/Fe) = 0.3. Because the brackets notation is log(base 10) of the ratio, right? So Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is twice that of the Sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means Fe/H is solar. So [Fe/H] is log(Fe/H) = 0, so Fe/H = 10^0 = 1, meaning Fe is as abundant relative to H as in the Sun. So Star_1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's.

So, if I know Fe is solar in Star_1, then the [Si/Fe] ratio of 0.3 would directly translate to Si being
