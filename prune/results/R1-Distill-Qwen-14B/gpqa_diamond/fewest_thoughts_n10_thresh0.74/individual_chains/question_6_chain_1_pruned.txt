Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a specific potential. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the potential determines the Hamiltonian, which then gives the energy levels.

The potential given is V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Wait, so it's a function of r and θ. Since it's two-dimensional, maybe it's in polar coordinates. Oh right, in two dimensions, the particle's motion can be separated into radial and angular parts if the potential allows it.

Let me break down the potential. The first term is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential. The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I think I can factor this or rewrite it in a way that separates the angular dependence. Because if the potential can be written as a function of r times a function of θ, then the Schrödinger equation might be separable.

Wait, the second term: (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Remember that cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2 = (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4)kr² + (3/4)kr² cos2θ.

Adding the first two terms: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². So V(r,θ) = (5/4)kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, but that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms that allow for separation of variables in the Schrödinger equation. Let me think about the form of the potential again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of angular momentum and other quantum numbers. The potential has a term with cos^2θ, which depends on the angle. That suggests that the angular part of the wavefunction will have a specific
