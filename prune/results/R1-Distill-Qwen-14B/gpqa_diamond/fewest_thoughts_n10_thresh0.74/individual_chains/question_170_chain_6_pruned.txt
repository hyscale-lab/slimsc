Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

Alright, the problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so the spin state is a two-component vector? I think that's right because spins are usually represented as two-element vectors in quantum mechanics. So the state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4. Let me write that down: χ = [3i; 4].

The question asks for the expectation value of S_y. Oh right, the expectation value is the average value you'd measure if you measured S_y many times on identically prepared systems. The formula I remember is the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y ħ χ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, let me get the Pauli matrix right. The σ_y matrix is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So that's a 2x2 matrix. And since the spin operators are S_x = ħ/2 σ_x, etc., so for S_y, it's (ħ/2) σ_y, but when calculating the expectation value, I think the formula might directly involve σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value is computed as (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y. So let's structure this step by step.

First, compute the expectation value of σ_y, then multiply by (ħ/2) to get ⟨S_y⟩.

So, the expectation value of σ_y is χ† σ_y χ. Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait. The state vector χ is a column vector, so the conjugate transpose χ† is a row vector with the complex conjugates of the components. So χ† would be [3i*, 4*]. Since 3i is 3i, its conjugate is -3i, and 4 is real, so 4* is 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, multiplying χ† (which is 1x2) by σ_y (2x2), which gives a 1x2 matrix. Then multiply that by χ (2x1), to get a scalar.

Let me write out the multiplication step by step.

σ_y is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So χ† σ_y would be [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by the σ_y matrix.

Let's compute each element:

The first element: (-3i)*0 + 4*i = 4i.

The second element: (-3i)*(-i) + 4*0 = (-3i)(-i) = 3i^2. Wait, i^2 is -1, so that's 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is -3.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now multiply this by χ, which is [3i; 4]. So:

(4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4) 

Let me compute each term:

First term: 4i * 3i = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: (-3) *4 = -12.

So the sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait a second, that gives the expectation value of σ_y as -24? That seems high because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1, so the expectation should be between -1 and 1. Oh wait, but wait: the state χ might not be normalized. So maybe I should normalize it first.

Oh right! The state vector should have a norm of 1 for it to be a valid quantum state. Let me check the norm of χ. The norm is the
