Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they give the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. I need to identify what compound X was from the options given.

Wait, wait. Oh, right, because they talk about the product, not compound X itself. But the question is asking to identify X, which must have reacted to form this product. So I need to figure out what reaction happened when X was treated with that reagent.

Hmm, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane rings a bell. Oh, that's a commonly used reagent in organic chemistry. I think it's used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's more like the Sharpless epoxidation, but that uses different reagents. Alternatively, I think it's used in the epoxidation of alkenes via the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Right, Prilezhaev oxidation uses a peracid, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is part of the reagent for epoxidationâ€”like in the epoxidation of alkenes using a peracid or other oxidizing agents. Wait, no, the reagent is actually part of the oxidizing system. Alternatively, wait, maybe it's used as a base in some reactions. Or perhaps it's part of the epoxidation process.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a type of amine, right? It's a bicyclic amine. Oh, wait, no, wait: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bicy
