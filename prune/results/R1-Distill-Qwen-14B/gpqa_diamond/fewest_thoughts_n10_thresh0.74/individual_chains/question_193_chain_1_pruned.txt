Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, it's asking about the change per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. I think the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. More precisely, plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

The question gives N ∝ 1/(plx^5). Let me write that as N = k * (1/plx^5), where k is some constant. But since we're dealing with proportions, I can just focus on the dependence without worrying about the constant.

Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute plx with 1/d in the equation. Let's do that. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplify that: 1/(1/d^5) ) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, no, let me check that again.

Wait, plx is 1/d. So plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is 1/(1/d^5) ) = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the distance to the fifth power.

But wait, wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So I think that's asking for the change in N with respect to r, like dN/dr.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr would be proportional to 5 d^4. But wait, the options don't have anything to the fifth or fourth power. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are: A) ~ r^3, B) ~ r^5
