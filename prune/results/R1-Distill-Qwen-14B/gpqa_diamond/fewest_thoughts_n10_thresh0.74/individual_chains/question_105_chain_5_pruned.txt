Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. So, Rstar is about the same as R_sun. But this star has dark spots covering one hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Wait, or is it 20% of the entire star? Hmm, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor refers to the hemisphere, so 20% of the hemisphere's area is spots. So the total area of spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, which is similar to the Sun, but the spots are cooler. The temperature difference is 1000 K, so the spots are at 5000 K, I guess? Or wait, does the 1000K difference mean the spots are 6000-1000=5000 K? I think that's correct.

So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, and this causes the observed brightness to vary. Because the spots are dark, when they face us, the star appears a bit dimmer. This photometric variation can be mistaken for an exoplanet transiting the star, which also causes a dip in brightness when it blocks some light.

The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as these spots? So if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same dip in brightness as the spots do.

So, I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (delta F) for both cases: the spots and the planet. Then, set them equal and solve for R_planet / R_star.

First, let's think about the star with spots.

The star's total brightness is the sum of the brightness from the spotted hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, and we're seeing it from Earth. When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots could be facing us, and then the other side when it rotates. But in this case, the problem
