Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's also moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects move, their properties as observed from different frames can change. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the lab? And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards me, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed in vacuum. But wait, is that the case when the medium itself is moving? Because if the medium is moving, the speed of the light might change according to the observer's frame.

Wait, no, I think the speed of light in a medium is always c/n, but that's in the rest frame of the medium. From the lab frame, where the medium is moving, the observed speed might be different. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Oh right, velocity addition isn't as simple as just adding or subtracting velocities when dealing with light.

Wait, but the glass is moving at velocity v, and light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n
