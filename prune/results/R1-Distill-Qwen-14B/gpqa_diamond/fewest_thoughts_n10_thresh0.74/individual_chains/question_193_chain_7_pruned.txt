Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, and the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance 'r'. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d), right? So plx = 1/d, which means that d is 1/plx. That makes sense. So if parallax increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to express this in terms of distance, 'r' probably, since the question is about how N changes with distance.

So let's substitute plx in terms of d. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So 1/plx^5 would be (d)^5. So N ∝ d^5, which is the same as r^5 if 'r' is similar to 'd'.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the units here. Parallax is in parsecs, right? And the number of stars per unit volume would depend on how the distance relates to the solid angle in the sky. But in this question, it's just about the number varying with parallax. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the question says the number varies as 1/plx^5, and I'm supposed to express it in terms of distance, I think substituting plx =1/d is the way to go.

So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5 → since plx =1/d, this becomes N ∝ (d)^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of d. Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, that's a bit different. Wait, per unit range. So perhaps they're asking about the number of stars in a shell of thickness dr at distance r.

Wait, that sounds like the number in a thin spherical shell.
