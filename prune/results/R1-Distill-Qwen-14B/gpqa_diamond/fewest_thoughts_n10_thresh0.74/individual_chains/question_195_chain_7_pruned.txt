Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit, with a transit impact parameter of 0.2, around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. Then they're asking about a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size. What's the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that it also shows both transit and occultation events? Both planets are in the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm, I think transit and occultation events occur when the planets pass in front of and behind the star from our point of view. For a transit, the planet must pass in front of the star (blocking some light), and for occultation, it's when the planet moves behind the star (so we don't see its reflected light anymore, or maybe we see the light dip as it's blocked by the star).

Wait, but for both events to occur, the orbital period has to be such that both transits and occultations are possible. How does that relate to the orbital period?

I remember that for a planet to transit a star, the planet's orbital plane must be aligned with our line of sight. But in this case, both planets share the same orbital plane, so that's already taken care of.

Now, the key here might be the relative sizes of the two planets and the star. Because occultation occurs when the planet goes behind the star, which depends on whether the star's apparent size is large enough to cover the planet when it's behind. If the planet is too large relative to the star, the occultation might not be observable because the planet's light isn't completely blocked.

Wait, but the star's radius is 1.5 times that of the Sun. The Sun's radius is much larger than Earth's. So the star is bigger than the Sun, but the planet sizes are Earth-sized or 2.5 Earths.

Wait, the first planet has Earth's radius, the second is 2.5 Earths. The star is 1.5 solar radii.

So, let's compute some ratios.

First, the star's radius is 1.5 Rsun, and the Sun's radius is about 109.7 times Earth's radius. So the star's radius is 1.5 * 109.7 Re â‰ˆ 164.55 Re.

The first planet is 1 Re, the second is 2.5 Re.

Now, for a planet to transit, the planet must pass in front of the star. The transit depth depends on the ratio of their areas. But for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, so the star must be larger than the planet. Wait, actually, the planet's apparent size must be smaller than the star's apparent size as seen from Earth. Otherwise, during the occultation, we might not detect a dip because
