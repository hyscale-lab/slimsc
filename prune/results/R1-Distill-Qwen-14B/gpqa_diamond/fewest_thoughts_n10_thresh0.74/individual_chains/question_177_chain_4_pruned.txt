Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, its mass is 1.5 times bigger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, right? Which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature.

So, if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because lambda_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So, T1 = T2.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Since both stars are black bodies, this formula applies.

Given that, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

L1 / L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴)

But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So, L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²) * (1/1), because R1 is 1.5 R2.

So R1 is 1.5 R2, so R1² is (2.25) R2². Therefore, L1/L2 is 2.25. So, the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2.

Wait, but the options are A) 2.25, B) 2.32, etc. So option A is 2.25. But wait, why is there another factor? Oh, wait, the question says "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So I thought it would be 2.25, which is A.

But wait, the problem also talks about radial velocities. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, wait, maybe that affects the observed wavelengths via Doppler shift, but the question says the wavelengths at which the stars "appeared brightest" are the same. So that part
