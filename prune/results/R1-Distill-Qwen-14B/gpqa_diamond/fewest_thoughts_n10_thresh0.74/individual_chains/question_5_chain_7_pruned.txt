Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand everything.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They've provided the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. My task is to find the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm, wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So direction n is in the x-z plane, which probably means that the angle θ is 90 degrees from the y-axis, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane is θ=0 for the x-axis, θ=π/2 for the y-axis, but wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So the x-z plane would be θ=0 and θ=π, but wait, that's more along the z-axis. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh, no, the x-z plane is defined by θ=π/2 in the y-axis. Wait, no, wait: the x-y plane is θ=π/2 in the z-axis direction. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. Oh yeah, θ is the angle from the positive z-axis, so the x-z plane would have θ = 0 (along +z) and θ = π/2 (along +x), wait, no. Wait, if θ is 0, that's the positive z-axis. θ=π/2 would be in the x-y plane, along the equator. So the x-z plane is θ=0 and θ=π, but wait, that's only the z-axis and its opposite. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the direction n is in the x-z plane, meaning that the direction has components in x and z, but no y component. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So φ
