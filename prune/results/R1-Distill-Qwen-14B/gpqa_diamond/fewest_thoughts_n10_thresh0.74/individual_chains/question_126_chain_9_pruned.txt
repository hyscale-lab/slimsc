Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the problem is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks the chemist would observe in each case.

First, let me break down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.
LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It's commonly used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So in this reaction, the ketone group (the -one) in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would be reduced. 

The structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is: 
The molecule is hexan-3-one, meaning the ketone is on carbon 3. Carbon 5 has a methoxy group (OCH3). So the structure is CH2-CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Upon reduction with LAH, the ketone (CO) becomes a CHOH group. So that produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but waitâ€”the starting material is (S) configuration at the chiral center. So after reduction, does the configuration change?

Wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at C3. The C5 has OCH3. So the molecule is (S)-configured at C5? Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure would have a chiral center at C5. Because when the carbonyl is at C3, the groups attached at C5 are: a CH2CH3 (from C6 and C5?), maybe. Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one: CH3(CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3? Wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula for hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO
