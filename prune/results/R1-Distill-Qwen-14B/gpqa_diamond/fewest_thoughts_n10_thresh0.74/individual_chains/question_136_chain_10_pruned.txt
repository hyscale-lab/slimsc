Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² and has only a radial component. 

Wait, so the field is radial, meaning it's pointing directly away or towards the origin, right? And its magnitude is 1/r². Oh, right, that's similar to the electric field of a point charge or the gravitational field. 

The problem says to find ∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of a sphere with radius R. So I need to compute the divergence of f and then integrate it over the volume. But wait, I remember from Maxwell's equations that the divergence of E is related to charge density. Oh wait, here it's just a generic field, but the method should be similar.

First, let's find the divergence of f. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, I can use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A(r) = A_r(r) r̂, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r(r)). 

In this case, f(r) has magnitude 1/r², so A_r = 1/r². So plugging into the divergence formula:

∇ · f = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) 

Simplify the inside first: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So taking the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇ · f = 0. 

Wait, but hold on. If the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Because 1/r² is for r not equal to zero. Oh, right, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0 where the field might have a singularity.

But the integral is over the volume of the sphere. So if the divergence is zero everywhere inside (since for r < R, the field is 1/r² which is defined and smooth except at r=0), then the integral would be zero. But wait, what about the origin? There might be a delta function or something there because the divergence isn't defined at r=0.

Oh, right! Because the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral could account for any singularities there. So maybe this relates to the Dirac delta function. Wait, how does that work?

Wait, the divergence theorem says that the volume integral of ∇ · f is equal to the surface integral of f · dA over the boundary. So if I apply the
