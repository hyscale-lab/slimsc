Okay, so I’ve got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll think it through.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. The question is about how many peaks they’ll observe in each case. The options are A to D, varying the number of peaks in chiral and normal-phase HPLC.

Let me start by looking at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reagent is LAH, which I remember is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one would become (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol after reduction. Wait, but wait, the structure: hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂COCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one would have the ketone at position 3. So, the structure is CH₂CH₂COCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon. Wait, let me think. Hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂COCH₂CH₂CH3. So the 5th carbon is the end. Wait no, hexan is six carbons. So numbering from the left, 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4, 5, 6. So the 5th carbon would be the second from the end. So 5-methoxy would be OMe attached to carbon 5. So, (S) configuration there.

After LAH reduction, the ketone group (C=O) at position 3 becomes a CHOH group. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So the structure would be CH₂CH₂CH(OH)CH₂CH(OCH3)CH3. Wait, no. Let me draw:

The original molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So:

Carbon 1: CH2-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-
Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, wait no, hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂CO. So hexan-3-one is:

CH₂CH₂C(O)CH₂CH₂CH3.

Wait, no, that's pentan-3-one. Wait, wait, no. Let me count. Hexan-3-one would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: CH2-
Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no. I think I'm getting this wrong. Hexan-3-one is CH₂CH₂C(O)CH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, wait no. Let me get the structure right. Hexan-3-one is:

CH₂CH₂-C(=O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH3?

Wait, that can't be right. Hexane is six carbons. So, 3-one would be:

CH₂CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, that's pentan-3-one. Oh, no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me recount.

Hexan-3-one: the ketone is on the third carbon of a six-carbon chain. So, the structure is:

CH₂CH₂-C(O)-CH₂-CH₂-CH3. So, yes, that's right. So that's five carbons after the ketone? Wait, no, let me number.

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons. So yes, hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂COCH₂CH₂CH3. Oh wait, that's pentan-3-one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula. Hexan-3-one is (CH₂)₂COCH₂CH₂CH3? No, that would be seven carbons. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's move on; perhaps the exact structure isn't needed for the reaction outcome, just that a ketone is reduced to an alcohol.

So, reaction I gives me (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup. Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2CO(CH3), I think. So, it's a diketone, with ketones on carbons 2 and 4.

NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent, but not as strong as LAH. Wait, but wait, in this case, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. So when reduced with NaBH4, which is a good enough reducing agent for ketones, both ketones would be reduced. But wait, wait, wait. NaBH4 typically can't reduce esters or amides, but can reduce ketones and aldehydes.

But when a diketone is treated with excess NaBH4, each ketone will be reduced. So, each ketone group (C=O) becomes a CHOH group. So, pentane-2,4-dione after reduction would become pentane-2,4-diol. So the structure would be (CH3)CHOHCH2CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The starting material is:

O
||
CH3-C-O-C-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane is five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione is (CH2)₂(CO)₂, but with the carbonyls on 2 and 4. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

That's correct. So when reduced, the two ketones become two CHOH groups. So the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, NaBH4 in a protic solvent, and upon acidic workup. So the product would be a vicinal diol, but wait, actually, no. Let me think again. Each ketone is on adjacent carbons (2 and 4? No, 2 and 4 are two carbons apart. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4 are separated by one CH2 group. So in pentane-2,4-dione, the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So the molecule is symmetrical. When reduced, each ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. So we get CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. That's 2,4-pentanediol. So each of the two ketones is reduced to an alcohol. So the product is a diol with two -OH groups on carbons 2 and 4.

Wait, but wait, when you have a diketone, can the reducing agent reduce both ketones? Or maybe only one? I thought that NaBH4 would reduce both, but perhaps in some cases, the second reduction is hindered. But in this case, the problem states that excess NaBH4 is used, so it should reduce both ketones.

So, reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, after both reactions are completed, the products are combined. So from reaction I, we have (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, and from reaction II, 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but wait, 2,4-pentanediol is a single compound, right? Or is it possible that it can exist as some kind of diastereomers?

Wait, let's think. 2,4-pentanediol has two hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons (no, wait, positions 2 and 4 are not adjacent; positions 2 and 3 are adjacent). Wait, no, 2 and 4 are separated by one carbon. So in pentane, 2 and 4 are two positions apart. So the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

So, each OH is on C2 and C4. Each of these can have R or S configurations.

Wait, but can the molecule have stereoisomerism? Let me consider. For each OH group, can it be R or S?

Looking at C2: the substituents are CH3, CH2CH(OH)CH3, OH, and CH2CH2OH-CH3? Wait, no, let me draw the structure:

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

So, looking at C2: the four groups are CH3, -CH2-CHOH-CH3, OH, and the adjacent C (which in this case is the same as the CH2 group). Wait, maybe this is better approached by considering the structure as HOCH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right. Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

So, each C2 and C4 have two CH2 groups attached. Wait, perhaps each OH is on a secondary carbon. So for each C2 and C4, can they have stereoisomerism?

Yes, because each OH is attached to a carbon that has four different substituents. Let's see:

At C2:

- The groups would be:

1. CH3 (from the adjacent C1)
2. OH
3. CH2-CHOH-CH3 (the chain leading to C3 and C4)
4. The two CH2 groups? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps each C2 and C4 has three CH2 groups and an OH. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetric, so the configurations at C2 and C4 are related. For instance, if C2 is R and C4 is R, or C2 is S and C4 is S, leading to a meso compound. Let me think.

The molecule is CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3. So, it's symmetrical around the middle CH2 group. So, if the configuration at C2 is R, then C4 must be S, and vice versa. Wait, no. Because the molecule is symmetric. So, if you have the two OH groups on the same face, it might lead to a meso form.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is a meso compound. So, if the configurations are opposite, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it meso. So, the molecule would have two stereocenters, but because of the symmetry, there are actually two enantiomers or a meso form.

Wait, let me check: the molecule is CH3-C(OH)H-CH2-C(OH)H-CH3. So, each OH is on C2 and C4.

At each stereocenter (C2 and C4), the substituents are:

- For C2: CH3, CH2-CHOH-CH3, OH, and the other adjacent group (maybe a hydrogen? Or a CH2 group? Wait, no, in this structure, each C2 and C4 is attached to a CH3, a CH2 group, an OH, and another group.

Wait, perhaps each C2 and C4 has four different substituents, making them stereocenters.

So, C2: attached to CH3 (C1), OH, CH2-CHOH-CH3 (C3 and C4), and a hydrogen? Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the structure again.

Pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, pentane is five carbons. So, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH2)₂(CO)₂. So, the correct structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Upon reduction with NaBH4, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So, the product is CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

Now, each of the OHs is on a secondary carbon (C2 and C4 in a five-carbon chain), each with four different substituents. So each is a stereocenter.

Now, the possible stereoisomers for 2,4-pentanediol:

The molecule has two stereocenters. So, without any symmetry, there would be 2^2 = 4 possible stereoisomers. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, some of these may be identical.

Wait, the molecule is symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure:

CH3-CHOH-CH2-CHOH-CH3.

If the configuration at C2 is R and at C4 is R, then the molecule would be:

C2: R, C4: R.

But given the symmetry, if you mirror the molecule, switching C2 and C4, you might end up with the same compound. Alternatively, perhaps the two stereocenters are in a meso arrangement, leading to an internal plane of symmetry.

So, for 2,4-pentanediol, the possible stereoisomers are:

1. Both OH groups in the same configuration (R,R or S,S). But wait, no, due to the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule can exist as a meso compound. Let me think of tartaric acid as an example, which is a meso compound with two stereocenters.

In the case of 2,4-pentanediol, if the configurations at C2 and C4 are opposite, the molecule becomes meso. So, for C2: R and C4: S (or vice versa), the molecule would be achiral because of the internal plane of symmetry.

If both are R or both S, then the molecule would be a pair of enantiomers, meaning two distinct stereoisomers (each being mirror images of each other).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. For a molecule with two stereocenters, the number of possible stereoisomers is up to four. But when there's a plane of symmetry, some stereoisomers may be identical.

In this case, when the configurations of C2 and C4 are opposite (R and S), the molecule becomes meso, which is one stereoisomer. When both are R, that's another stereoisomer, and both S would be its enantiomer. But wait, no: if both are R, then the molecule would have a certain configuration, and both S would be its mirror image. But wait, no, if C2 is R and C4 is R, can that be possible in this symmetrical molecule? Or would that configuration lead to a different molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the two stereocenters are adjacent in a way that makes the configurations interdependent. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the product of reaction II, 2,4-pentanediol, can exist as a meso compound and as a pair of enantiomers. Let me explain.

If both OH groups are on the same face (both R or both S), then the molecule has two stereocenters, and no plane of symmetry. So it would have two enantiomers (R,R and S,S), each being a pair of enantiomers.

But wait, no. If the configurations are R and R, the molecule would be a diastereomer of the meso compound. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. Let me think: the molecule has two stereocenters, C2 and C4. The possible configurations are RR, SS, RS, SR. Now, if the configurations are RS, then the molecule has a plane of symmetry (since C2 and C4 are symmetric) and thus is a meso compound. So, in that case, RS and SR are the same because of the symmetry, leading to a meso form.

So, the possible stereoisomers are:

1. RR: which would be one enantiomer.
2. SS: the other enantiomer, which is the mirror image of RR.
3. RS: which is the same as SR, making a meso compound.

So, total stereoisomers: three. Wait, that can't be right because two stereocenters should give four possibilities. Oh, wait, no. Because of the internal symmetry, RS and SR are identical, so they count as one. So, the total number of stereoisomers would be three: RR, SS, and the meso form (RS/SR).

Wait, but that can't be right because for two stereocenters, without symmetry, there are four possible stereoisomers. But in this case, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so some configurations become identical.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: in the case of 2,4-pentanediol, the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. So, when the configurations are opposite (R and S), the molecule is meso. When configurations are same (R and R or S and S), each forms a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the configurations are same, then the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry, leading to two enantiomers. So, the possibilities are:

- Both R: which is enantiomer A.
- Both S: which is enantiomer B (mirror image of A).
- One R and one S: which is meso and only one compound.

So, total of three possible stereoisomers.

But wait, if the molecule is symmetric, then configurations R and S at C2 and C4 would lead to a meso compound, which is a single compound. So, in reaction II, when pentane-2,4-dione is reduced, what's the product in terms of stereochemistry?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me move forward. When you reduce a symmetrical diketone like pentane-2,4-dione with a reducing agent, what happens? Does the product form a racemic mixture or a meso compound?

Wait, because the starting material is a symmetrical diketone, upon reduction, the product might form a meso compound. Because the reduction would proceed in a way that the two hydroxyl groups end up on opposite sides, leading to the meso form.

Wait, but wait. In the case of a symmetrical ketone, when you reduce it, the product can end up as a racemic mixture or as a meso compound, depending on whether the starting material is chiral and how the reduction occurs.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetrical molecule. So, when you reduce it, each ketone is reduced independently. But because the molecule is symmetrical, the reduction would lead to the same product on both sides. So, the product would be a meso compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

So, reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol in the meso form. So, it's a single compound, not a mixture of stereoisomers.

Wait, no. Because the reduction of each ketone is independent, so each OH group could be formed with a certain configuration. If the reducing agent doesn't lead to any preference, then perhaps the product would be a racemic mixture, but considering the symmetry, perhaps it's a single meso compound.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the mechanism. NaBH4 is a strong reducing agent that typically proceeds through a two-step mechanism, with the hydride attack leading to the formation of an alkoxide, which is then protonated during the acidic workup.

In the case of a symmetrical diketone, when each ketone is attacked by a hydride, the configuration of each OH group would be determined by the approach of the hydride. But since the molecule is symmetrical, the attack on each ketone would mirror each other, leading to the same configuration on each side, resulting in a meso compound.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's easier to think that the product of reaction II is a single compound, the meso form. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but that would complicate things.

But perhaps the product is a single compound, the meso form, because of the symmetry. So reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol as a meso compound, meaning it's a single stereoisomer.

Wait, but wait, if the product is a meso compound, then it's achiral, meaning it won't show any peaks in a chiral HPLC column. Whereas, if it's a racemic mixture, it would show up as a single peak in a normal-phase HPLC because both enantiomers would elute together, but in a chiral column, they would separate into two peaks. But if the product is a meso compound, it's a single peak in both column types.

Wait, but earlier I thought reaction II gave a meso compound. So, let me proceed with that assumption for now.

Now, combining the products from reactions I and II. Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single enantiomer. Reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol as a meso compound, which is a single compound.

Wait, but wait, reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol. Let me confirm.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is being reduced to 2,4-pentanediol. The question is: how many stereoisomers does this product have?

If the product is meso, then it's a single compound. So, from reaction II, you get one product.

But wait, what if the product has multiple stereoisomers?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. If the starting material is symmetrical, the product would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. So, the product is a single compound.

So, the products are:

From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. One compound.

From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol (meso form). One compound.

So, when combined, you have two compounds in total: one from each reaction.

Now, they run these products on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral column.

In normal-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is polar (like silica), and the mobile phase is non-polar. The separation is based on the polarity of the compounds. So, the more polar the compound, the more it interacts with the stationary phase and the later it elutes.

In a chiral HPLC column, the stationary phase is chiral, and it separates enantiomers based on their interaction with the chiral stationary phase. So, if a compound is chiral, it will split into two peaks (enantiomers). If it's achiral, it will elute as a single peak.

Now, let's look at each product.

First product: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This is a chiral compound because it has a stereocenter at C3. So, in the chiral HPLC column, it should elute as a single peak because it's a single enantiomer. Wait, no, wait. No, the chiral HPLC column is used to separate enantiomers. So, if you have only one enantiomer, it will interact in a certain way with the stationary phase, leading to a single peak. So, in the chiral column, it would give one peak.

Wait, no. Wait, in a chiral column, the stationary phase is chiral, so each enantiomer will have a different retention time. But if you have only one enantiomer, it will pass through and give a single peak. So, yes, it would give one peak.

The second product: 2,4-pentanediol in the meso form. Since it's a meso compound, it's achiral. So, in a chiral HPLC column, it would elute as a single peak because there's no enantiomer to separate.

In the normal-phase HPLC, both of these compounds are separated based on polarity.

So, the normal-phase HPLC would separate the two compounds into two peaks: one for each compound.

Wait, but wait. The first compound, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, is more polar than the second, 2,4-pentanediol? Or vice versa?

Well, hexan-3-ol is a six-carbon alcohol, while pentanediol is a five-carbon diol. The hexan-3-ol has a longer chain, which is generally less polar than a shorter chain with more polar groups. Wait, but wait, the diol has two hydroxyl groups, which are polar. So, 2,4-pentanediol is more polar than hexan-3-ol because it has two OH groups versus one.

Wait, no. Hexan-3-ol has one OH group. 2,4-pentanediol has two OH groups. So, pentanediol is more polar. So, in normal-phase HPLC, the more polar compounds elute later (higher retention). So, the pentanediol would come out later than the hexanol.

So, on a normal-phase column, you would see two peaks: one for the hexanol, and one for the pentanediol.

In the chiral column, both compounds are present. The hexanol is chiral, so it gives one peak. The pentanediol is achiral, so it gives another single peak. So, in the chiral column, you would see two peaks.

Wait, but wait. No, wait. From reaction I, you get (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is a single enantiomer, so in the chiral column, it's a single peak. From reaction II, you get 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is a single, achiral compound, so in the chiral column, it also gives a single peak. So, in total, two peaks on both columns.

Wait, but I'm trying to think if any of the products have more than one stereoisomer. Let me recheck reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is reduced to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a single enantiomer. So, one compound, and it's chiral.

Reaction II: produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's a single, achiral compound.

So, when combined, the products are two compounds: one chiral, one achiral.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC, two peaks: one from the chiral compound, and one from the achiral.

Wait, but wait. If I have a chiral column, and a compound that's achiral, would it elute as a single peak? Yes, because the column can't separate enantiomers if they aren't present. If the compound is achiral, it doesn't have enantiomers, so it's just one peak.

So, in the chiral column, two peaks: one for (S)-hexanol, and one for the meso pentanediol.

In the normal-phase column, two peaks as well: the same two compounds, separated based on polarity.

But wait, the options don't have two peaks in both. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4
B) 3 and 2
C) 4 and 2
D) 3 and 3.

Wait, none of the options have 2 and 2. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I overlooked some aspect. Let me re-examine both reactions.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH.

LAH is a strong reducing agent. It should reduce the ketone to an alcohol, giving (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, could there be any other products? For example, could there be some racemization during the reaction? No, LAH typically doesn't cause racemization when reducing ketones to secondary alcohols because the reaction is typically carried out under conditions that don't favor epimerization. So, the product is a single stereoisomer.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4.

As I thought earlier, this produces 2,4-pentanediol. But in this case, perhaps the product isn't a meso compound but a racemic mixture. Wait, why? Because NaBH4 is a reducing agent that doesn't have any preference in the configuration of the resulting alcohol.

Wait, but the starting material is symmetrical, so perhaps the product will be a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. When NaBH4 reduces a ketone, it adds a hydride to the carbonyl carbon. The hydride can approach from either face, leading to possible R or S configurations. But in a symmetrical ketone, like pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is in a symmetrical position. So when the hydride attacks each ketone, the resulting configurations would mirror each other, leading to a meso compound.

So, reaction II gives a single product, the meso diol.

So, the two products are (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the meso 2,4-pentanediol. So, two compounds in total.

When run on normal-phase HPLC, each would elute as a single peak, so two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC, each would also elute as a single peak, so two peaks.

Looking at the options, none of them have two and two. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps reaction II gives more than one product. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I missed that reaction II produces more than one stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about reaction II. Let me think again.

Pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetrical molecule. When reduced with NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. Since the molecule is symmetrical, the attack by the hydride on each ketone would be mirrored, leading to the same configuration on each side, resulting in a meso compound. So reaction II gives only one product.

Thus, the products are two compounds, each giving one peak in both HPLC columns. But none of the options match this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products from reaction I. Let me think again. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, when reduced, gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Only one product.

Reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol as a meso compound. So, two products in total. So, on both columns, two peaks.

But the options don't have that option. So perhaps I'm making a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps reaction II produces more than one stereoisomer. Let me think differently. If the product is a racemic mixture, it would have two enantiomers, but because of the symmetry, perhaps they form a meso compound, resulting in a single product.

Alternatively, maybe the product of reaction II is a pair of enantiomers, leading to two stereoisomers.

Wait, but no, because the starting material is symmetrical. The product would be a meso compound, so one product.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another angle. Let me think about the possibility that reaction I gives more than one product.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, that's one compound.

So, combining, two compounds. So, two peaks in each HPLC.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I've miscounted the number of products.

Wait, perhaps reaction II doesn't produce a meso compound. Let me assume that the product is a racemic mixture. So, 2,4-pentanediol would be present as a racemic mixture, giving two enantiomers.

But no, because the starting material is symmetrical, the product would be meso, not a racemic mixture.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and the product is a racemic mixture. So, reaction II gives two enantiomers.

If that's the case, then the products are:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (one compound).

Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol as a racemic mixture (two enantiomers).

So, when combined, you have three compounds in total: one from reaction I, and two from reaction II.

Now, let's run them on the two HPLC columns.

In normal-phase HPLC: each compound is separated based on polarity. So, three compounds → three peaks.

In chiral HPLC: each enantiomer is separated. So, reaction I's product is a single enantiomer → one peak. Reaction II's product is a racemic mixture → two peaks. So, total three peaks in chiral HPLC.

So, the chromatograms would show three peaks in chiral HPLC and three in normal-phase. But looking at the options, option D says three peaks in both. So, option D would be the answer.

But wait, earlier I thought reaction II gives a meso compound (one product), leading to two peaks in each HPLC. But if reaction II gives two enantiomers, then the products are three, leading to three peaks in each column.

So, which is correct?

I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify.

The key is to determine whether reaction II gives a meso compound or a racemic mixture.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione (a symmetrical diketone) is reduced with excess NaBH4.

NaBH4 is a reducing agent that, in the case of a symmetrical ketone, would produce a meso compound. Because the reduction would occur on both ketones, and the symmetry would cause the OH groups to be on opposite sides, leading to a meso form.

So, reaction II gives 2,4-pentanediol as a single meso compound.

So, the products are two compounds: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

Thus, each product is a single compound.

So, when run on normal-phase HPLC, each would elute as a single peak, giving two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC, each would also elute as a single peak. The first product is chiral, so it would give one peak. The second product is achiral, so it would give another peak. So, two peaks in total on the chiral column.

But none of the options match this scenario. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent and would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, giving (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So, only one product.

So, the products are two, leading to two peaks in each column. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction outcomes.

Another possibility: perhaps reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a chiral ketone. Upon reduction, could it lead to some racemization?

Wait, no, because when you reduce a ketone with LAH, you typically get the corresponding alcohol with retention of configuration. So, the product would be a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product from reaction II again. If reaction II actually produces more than one product, perhaps two.

Wait, if the product is a racemic mixture, but considering the molecule's symmetry, perhaps it's a meso compound plus another diastereomer.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from reaction II is not a meso compound but a pair of enantiomers, leading to two products.

But I'm not sure. Let me think about a similar example. For instance, when cyclohexanone is treated with a reducing agent, it produces cyclohexanol, which is a single enantiomer if starting from a single enantiomer, but in the case of a symmetrical diketone, the product would be a meso compound.

So, reaction II would give a single product, the meso diol.

Thus, the two products are (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So, in normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

In chiral HPLC: two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps reaction I produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which is chiral, and reaction II produces two enantiomers, so the total number of products is three.

Wait, but earlier I thought reaction II produces a meso compound, which is a single product.

Alternatively, perhaps reaction II produces two enantiomers, making a racemic mixture.

So, from reaction II: a racemic mixture of 2,4-pentanediol, which would be two enantiomers.

So, the products are:

- (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (1 compound)
- 2,4-pentanediol as a racemic mixture (2 compounds)

Total: 3 compounds.

In normal-phase HPLC: three peaks (each compound is separated based on polarity).

In chiral HPLC: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a single enantiomer → 1 peak. The 2,4-pentanediol racemic mixture would split into two peaks. So, total three peaks in chiral HPLC.

Thus, the chromatograms would show three peaks in both columns. So, option D.

But wait, the normal-phase HPLC would separate the three compounds based on their polarity. So, three peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, the (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol gives one peak, and the two enantiomers of the pentanediol give two peaks. So, three peaks in total.

So, the correct answer would be D: 3 peaks in both.

But this depends on whether reaction II produces a racemic mixture or a meso compound.

If reaction II produces a racemic mixture, then the answer is D.

If it produces a meso compound, then the answer would be two peaks in each, which is not among the options.

But looking at the options, option D is the only one that has three peaks in both.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D: 3 peaks in both HPLC columns.


The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist, followed by analyzing the products on two HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Reaction I:
The starting material is **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**, a chiral ketone. When treated with **LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride)**, a strong reducing agent, the ketone group at position 3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol. The product is **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**, which retains its chirality at the stereocenter. This reaction produces a single enantiomer, so only one compound is formed.

### Reaction II:
The starting material is **pentane-2,4-dione**, a symmetrical diketone. When treated with **excess NaBH4**, a reducing agent, both ketone groups are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming **2,4-pentanediol**. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, the product is a **meso compound** (2,4-pentanediol), which is achiral. Thus, this reaction produces a single compound.

### Combined Products:
After the reactions, the products are combined:
1. **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** (chiral, single enantiomer).
2. **2,4-pentanediol** (meso compound, achiral).

### Analysis on HPLC Columns:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**: Separation is based on polarity. The two distinct compounds (one chiral and one achiral) will elute as **two separate peaks**.
2. **Chiral HPLC**: Separation is based on chirality. 
   - **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol** is chiral and will elute as a single peak (one enantiomer).
   - **2,4-pentanediol** is achiral and will elute as a single peak.
   - Therefore, the chiral column will also show **two peaks**.

### Conclusion:
The chromatograms will show **two peaks** in both the normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning, the closest match is **Option D**, which assumes three peaks in both columns. This discrepancy suggests an error in the problem setup or interpretation.
