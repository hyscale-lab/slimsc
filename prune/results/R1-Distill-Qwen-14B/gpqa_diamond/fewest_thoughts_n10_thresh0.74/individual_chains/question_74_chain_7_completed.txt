Okay, I need to figure out this probability problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, let's think. So the question is about an atom that has a certain decay probability. From what I remember, radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So the decay process is memoryless, meaning it doesn't depend on how much time has already passed.

Wait, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means that the probability of decay, P, is 0.32 over 100 minutes. Now, they've already waited 50 minutes, and the atom hasn't decayed. I need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes? So that's 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. Or is it 150 minutes from now, making the total time 100 minutes? Wait, no, the question says "the next 150 minutes." So the initial 50 minutes have passed without decay, and now we're looking at the next 150 minutes.

Wait, the decay is modeled by the equation P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. Or alternatively, the probability of decay by time t is given by that formula.

But wait, perhaps it's better to think about the decay constant. Since the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, that implies that the decay constant λ can be calculated.

So let's calculate λ first. The probability of decay in time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural log on both sides, -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, but wait. Wait, ln(0.68) is negative because 0.68 is less than 1. So ln(0.68) is approximately, let's compute that. Let me think: ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less, so maybe around -0.3856. So λ is approximately 0.3856 / 100, which is 0.003856 per minute.

But perhaps I should compute it accurately. Let me calculate ln(0.68). Using a calculator (pretending to compute), ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. So the probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is P(50) = 1 - e^(-λ*50) = e^(-50λ). Wait, no, wait. The probability that it hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt). So the survival probability is e^(-λt). So after 50 minutes, the probability that it hasn't decayed is e^(-50λ) = e^(- (0.0038566)*50 ). Let me calculate that exponent: 0.0038566 *50 = 0.19283. So e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8246. So the survival probability is about 82.46%. So the probability that it hasn't decayed is around 82.46%, which makes sense because the chance to decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so in 50 minutes, less time, it's lower.

But wait, the question is, given that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes. So the total time is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

But since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes from now is the same as the probability of decay in 150 minutes from the start, given that it hasn't decayed yet. Alternatively, the conditional probability.

Wait, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that it has survived up to time t0, is the same as the probability of decay in the next t minutes from time zero. So in this case, the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 (150 minutes later) is equal to the probability that it decays in 150 minutes starting from time zero, given that it hasn't decayed before.

Wait, no, more accurately, the conditional probability that it decays in the next t minutes, given that it has survived up to t0, is equal to 1 - e^(-λ t). Because the memoryless property means that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is independent of how long it's been waiting.

Wait, so the probability from t=50 to t=200 is P = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Wait, but let me double-check. The probability that the atom decays after time t0 but before t0 + t is equal to P(t0 + t) - P(t0) = [1 - e^(-λ (t0 + t)))] - [1 - e^(-λ t0))] = e^(-λ t0) [1 - e^(-λ t)].

So in our case, t0 is 50 minutes, t is 150 minutes.

So the probability is e^(-λ *50) * [1 - e^(-λ *150)].

Wait, but earlier, I thought that since the process is memoryless, it's equal to the probability over 150 minutes, but that's not correct. Because the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed before, is P = 1 - e^(-λ t).

Wait, but according to the formula, it's e^(-λ t0) [1 - e^(-λ t)].

So let's compute this.

We have e^(-λ *50) ≈ 0.8246 as before.

Then, 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150). Let's compute 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849. So e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.5607. So 1 - 0.5607 ≈ 0.4393, or 43.93%.

So the probability is 0.8246 * 0.4393 ≈ 0.362, which is about 36.2%. Wait, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, this can't be right because the options are all in the 40s or 50s. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to think in terms of the decay law. Since the process is memoryless, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes from the start, given that it hasn't decayed yet.

Wait, no, the memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed up to time t0, is the same as the probability of decay in the next t minutes starting from time 0. So in this case, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ t), where t is 150 minutes.

Wait, but that would be 1 - e^(-0.0038566*150) ≈ 1 - e^(-0.57849) ≈ 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is 43.93%. Hmm, but that's not in the options either. The options are 44%, which is close, but let me recheck my calculations.

Wait, earlier, I computed λ as 0.0038566 per minute. Let me recheck that:

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ), so e^(-100λ) = 0.68. Taking ln of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute. Correct.

So 150 minutes: 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849. e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.5607. So 1-0.5607 is 0.4393, which is about 43.93%, so 44%. So option A is 44%.

Wait, but the options have A as 44%, which would be the answer. But wait, wait, let me think again. Because wait, the decay in the next 150 minutes is 43.93%, which is approximately 44%, which is option A.

But wait, why did I get a different result earlier when I used the formula P = e^(-λ t0) [1 - e^(-λ t)]? That gave me around 36% which doesn't match. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. The probability to decay between t0 and t0 + t is P = P(t0 + t) - P(t0) = [1 - e^(-λ(t0 + t))] - [1 - e^(-λ t0)] = e^(-λ t0) [1 - e^(-λ t)].

So in our case, t0 is 50, t is 150.

So e^(-0.0038566 *50) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8246.

Then, [1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150)] = 1 - e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.4393.

So P = 0.8246 * 0.4393 ≈ 0.362, so 36.2%. But that's not matching the 43.93% I got earlier. So which approach is correct?

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results with two different methods, but that can't be right. So where is the mistake?

Ah, wait a second. Let's clarify. The decay probability in the next 150 minutes after t0 is the same as the probability that the atom decays between t =50 and t=200. The memoryless property tells us that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, regardless of how much time has already passed, is 1 - e^(-λ t). So the correct approach should be simply 1 - e^(-λ * 150), which is approximately 43.93%, so 44% which is option A.

Wait, but why does the first approach give a different answer? Oh, because that approach calculates the probability of decay in a specific interval, considering the survival up to t0. But the memoryless property says that, given it has survived t0, the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same as if you start fresh.

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, let me think: the probability that the atom decays between t =0 and t=150 is 0.32 when t=100 is 0.32. Wait, no, the given is that in 100 minutes, the probability is 0.32. So it's 0.32 over 100 minutes. So when you're looking at the next 150 minutes, that's a longer time, so the probability should be higher than 32%.

Wait, but according to my calculation, 150 minutes gives about 43.93% which is higher than 32%. So that makes sense.

But earlier, when I computed it using the P(t0 + t) - P(t0), I got 36.2%. So which method is correct?

Wait, let me re-examine the formula.

The correct formula for the probability that decay occurs between t0 and t0 + t is P(t0 + t) - P(t0).

Which is [1 - e^(-λ (t0 + t))] - [1 - e^(-λ t0)] = e^(-λ t0) [1 - e^(-λ t)].

So in our case, t0=50, t=150.

e^(-λ *50) = 0.8246.

1 - e^(-λ *150) = 0.4393.

Multiply these: 0.8246 * 0.4393 ≈ 0.362, which is 36.2%.

But this contradicts the memoryless approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the memoryless property. The memoryless property is for the conditional probability. It states that the probability that the atom decays in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet up to time t0, is equal to 1 - e^(-λ t). So in that case, the probability would be 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 0.4393, which is 43.93% or 44%. So that would be option A.

But according to the formula P(t0 + t) - P(t0), it's 36.2%. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from what is being calculated. The formula P(t0 + t) - P(t0) is the probability that the atom decays between t0 and t0 + t. The memoryless approach, on the other hand, is P(decays in next t minutes | survived up to t0). Which is the same as [P(decays between t0 and t0 + t) ] / [P(survived up to t0)].

Ah, right! That's an important point. Because the event "decays between t0 and t0 +t" is a subset of "survived up to t0".

So P(decays between t0 and t0 + t | survived up to t0) = [P(decays between t0 and t0 +t)] / [P(survived up to t0)].

Which is [e^(-λ t0) (1 - e^(-λ t))] / e^(-λ t0) ) ] = 1 - e^(-λ t).

So, the conditional probability is 1 - e^(-λ t). So in this case, it's 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 43.93%.

So the correct answer should be 44%, option A.

But earlier, when I computed using P(t0 + t) - P(t0), I got 36.2%, which is different. So why is that?

Because that's the absolute probability of decay between t0 and t0 + t, not the conditional probability.

In this question, they're asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So it's the conditional probability, which is 43.93%, so option A, 44%.

Wait, but let me make sure. So the correct approach is to calculate the conditional probability, which is 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 44%. So the answer is A.

But let me think again: the initial 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. The question is, what's the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes.

The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, B is the event that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. A is the event that it decays in the next 150 minutes.

So A ∩ B is the event that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes. And B is the event that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes.

So P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = [P(50 < t <= 200)] / P(t >=50).

We already have P(t >=50) = e^(-λ *50) = 0.8246.

P(50 < t <= 200) = P(t <=200) - P(t <=50) = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ*50) [1 - e^(-λ *150)].

So putting it together, P(A|B) = [e^(-λ*50) (1 - e^(-λ *150)) ] / e^(-λ *50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 0.4393.

So the probability is 43.93%, which is approximately 44%, so the answer is A.


To solve the problem, we use the memoryless property of radioactive decay, which states that the probability of decay in the next \( t \) minutes, given that the atom has not decayed up to the current time, is independent of the elapsed time. The decay process follows an exponential law, and the probability of decay by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem provides that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, or \( P(100) = 0.32 \). From this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

\[
e^{-100\lambda} = 0.68
\]

\[
-100\lambda = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. By the memoryless property, this is equivalent to the probability of decay in 150 minutes starting from time zero. Thus, we compute:

\[
P_{\text{decay in 150 minutes}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5607
\]

\[
P_{\text{decay in 150 minutes}} = 1 - 0.5607 \approx 0.4393 \, \text{or} \, 43.93\%.
\]

This rounds to approximately 44%. Therefore, the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is **44%**, corresponding to option A.
