Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture. So, this ρ is a 2x2 matrix because it's dealing with qubits, which are two-level systems.

Wait, let me write this out in matrix form to get a better idea. The |0><0| is the outer product, which would be a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom-right corner. So when I add them together and multiply by 1/2, each of those 1s becomes 1/2. So the matrix ρ is diagonal with entries 1/2 and 1/2.

So ρ is:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

That looks familiar. Oh right, this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. It represents a completely classical mixture of |0> and |1>, with equal probability for each state.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit confused about what that means. I think it refers to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a geometric way to represent qubit states. Each point on the sphere corresponds to a quantum state, with the north pole being |0> and the south pole |1>.

Wait, but ρ is a density matrix, so it's not a pure state. A pure state would have a trace of 1 and the density matrix would be a projector (like |ψ><ψ|). Here, ρ is a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture.

In the Bloch sphere, a density matrix can be represented as a point inside the sphere, with pure states on the surface and mixed states inside. The position is determined by the Bloch vector. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), which correspond to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices X, Y, Z respectively.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,
where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector.

Let me rearrange ρ to match this form. Given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which can be written as (I)/2, since |0><0| + |1><1| is the identity matrix I.

So ρ = (I)/2. Comparing to ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, that implies r·σ must be zero. Therefore, r must be the zero vector (0,0,0).

So the geometrical position of ρ is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Looking at the options:

A) (1,1,0)
B
