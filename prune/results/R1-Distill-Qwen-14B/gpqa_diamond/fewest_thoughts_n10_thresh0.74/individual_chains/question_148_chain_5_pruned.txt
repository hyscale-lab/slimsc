Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds mentioned, labeled A1 through A5.

The problem describes a series of reactions and properties of these compounds. My goal is to figure out the molecular weight range of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B) 220-240, C) 160-180, D) 110-130.

Let me start by reading each part carefully.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine gas. The oF (I think this stands for oxidation state or maybe oxygen-free, but probably oxidation state) of F in A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, wait, fluorine's oxidation state is usually -1, but maybe in A2, it's different. Wait, but I'm not sure what oF refers to. Oh wait, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass. Because 31.96% sounds familiar. Let me think: the atomic weight of fluorine is about 19. So if A2 is something like YF, then maybe the fluorine content is 19/(Y+19) *100 = 31.96%. Let me calculate that.

Let me set up the equation: 19/(Y+19) = 0.3196. Multiply both sides by (Y+19): 19 = 0.3196(Y +19). So Y+19=19/0.3196 ≈ 60. So Y≈60-19=41. Hmm, Y would be around 41. Which element has an atomic weight around 41? That's Ga (gallium) at about 69.94? No, wait. Oh, no, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 19 divided by 0.3196 is approximately 59.43. So Y+19=59.43 → Y≈40.43. Hmm, that's close to Zr (zirconium is about 91), no. Wait, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong element. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps A2 is YF3. Wait, no, because in YF3, fluorine would be 3*19/(Y+3*19) *100. Let me see: 57/(Y+57)=0.3196 → Y+57=57/0.3196≈178. So Y≈178-57=121. That would be Te (tellurium is about 128), close. But I'm not sure if this is the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The decomposition of A1 produces A2 and F2. So the reaction could be something like A1 → A2 + F2. If A1 is a higher fluoride, maybe YF5 decomposes into YF3 and F2. Or perhaps A1 is YF2, which doesn't make sense because fluorine usually has a -1 charge. Wait, maybe A1 is a more complex fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a diatomic molecule. Wait, but fluorine is F2, so maybe A1 is a fluoride with multiple fluorine atoms.

Wait, another approach: A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Similarly, A3 can also interact with xenon. So these compounds are likely fluorides that can fluorinate xenon, which is a noble gas. So perhaps they are fluorine-rich compounds, like YF6 or something similar.

Wait, when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. So
