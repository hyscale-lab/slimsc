Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, the question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor. I'm a bit rusty on my orbital mechanics, but let's think it through.

So, the setup: there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the orbital period for system_1 is longer than system_2.

Then, there are these radial velocity (RV) measurements. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's stars have amplitudes of 15 and 10. I remember that in a binary system, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star would have a smaller orbit, right? So the less massive star moves faster, hence a higher RV amplitude.

Wait, so the RV amplitude is proportional to the mass of the companion, but inversely? Or wait, the velocity semi-amplitude (K) depends on the mass of the other star. The formula I vaguely remember is K = (v) = (2πG / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), where M2 is the mass of the companion and P is the orbital period.

Wait, but more accurately, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (2π G ) / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )^(1/3) ) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) ), but since the eccentricity e is not given, perhaps we're assuming circular orbits, so e=0, and that term drops out.

But in this problem, since both stars in each system are observed, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So for a given system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude, and the less massive has a larger one.

So in system_1: star A has K1=10, star B has K2=5. Wait, but that would mean that M_A and M_B are inversely proportional to their velocities. So M_A / M_B = K_B /
