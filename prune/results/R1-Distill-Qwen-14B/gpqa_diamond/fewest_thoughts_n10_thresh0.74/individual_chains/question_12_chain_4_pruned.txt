Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let me read the question again. 

The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, right, pion decay. The pion is Pi(+) at rest, and it decays into a muon and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. I remember that in these kinds of problems, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero, so the products must have equal and opposite momenta. 

Wait, but neutrinos are neutral and super light. I think the muon neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's. So maybe we can treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation. That would probably simplify things a lot.

So, let me think about the energy and momentum. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² * c²? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. No, E is in units of MeV, so E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu)^2 c^4 + (m_mu c²)^2 )^(1/2). Wait, no, because p is in MeV/c units, maybe.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of four-momentum. The pion is at rest, so its four-momentum is (E, 0) where E = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the muon and neutrino have four-momenta (E_mu, p_mu) and (E_nu, p_nu). Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum must be zero, so p_mu = -p_nu. 

Assuming the neutrino is massless, E_nu = |p_nu| c. But wait, in units where c=1, E_nu = |p_nu|. So p_mu = -p_nu, but magnitude-wise, |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. So E_nu = p c, but since we're using units where c=1, E_nu = p.

Now, the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p)^2 + m_mu^2 ). 

Conservation of energy says:

E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 = sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p

Hmm, that looks like an equation I can solve for p. Let's set x = p.

So 139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x

Let me subtract
