Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C. Hmm. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Another reaction is C reacting with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. And D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

The question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. I remember that symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So I need to figure out what E is, then determine its molecular structure and thus its symmetry.

Let me try to figure out what each substance could be. Let's start with the reactions.

First reaction: A + 8 B → C (bright red). I'm thinking about compounds that form bright red products. Maybe something like sulfur? Sulfur is bright yellow, but perhaps another element. Oh wait, maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). Because 8 equivalents of Cl2 reacting with Na would form NaCl. But wait, NaCl is a white solid. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: if A is copper (Cu) and B is sulfur (S). But Cu and S reacting would form Cu2S, which is black. Not red. Alternatively, if B is oxygen, but that's O2. Or perhaps another approach.

Wait, another idea: maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). So 8 equivalents of Cl2 would react with 2 moles of Na to form 2 moles of NaCl and some Cl. Wait, maybe not. Let me think about the equation.

Wait, sodium reacts with chlorine to form NaCl. The balanced equation is 2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl. So 1 equivalent of Cl2 reacts with 2 equivalents of Na. So if the first reaction used 8 equivalents of B (Cl2), then A would be 16 equivalents of Na. But the product is C, which is bright red. NaCl is white, so that doesn't fit. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (
