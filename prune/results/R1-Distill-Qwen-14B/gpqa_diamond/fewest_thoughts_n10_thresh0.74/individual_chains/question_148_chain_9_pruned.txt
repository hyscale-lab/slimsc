Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with some element Y. There are five such compounds. We have several substances A1 to A5, each with different properties, and I need to figure out the molecular weight range of A4.

First, I'll list out the information given about each substance.

A1: Decomposes at 293 K into A2 (with oF=31.96%) and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing Xenon, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually inert, but when it reacts, maybe it's being oxidized, which would imply that A1 is a strong oxidizer. 

Wait, fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So maybe A1 is some kind of fluoride that's a strong oxidizing agent. Or perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state?

A2 is a decomposition product of A1, and it has oF (I think that's oxygen of fluorine or maybe the mass fraction of F) of 31.96%. Let me calculate what that could mean. So the mass of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%. So if I take a compound where F is 31.96% by mass, what could that be? Let me think about some common fluorides.

Wait, fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19. So if a compound has F as 31.96%, let's say the formula is YF_x. Let's assume it's YF3 or something like that. Let's calculate.

Wait, let's suppose A2 is YF3. The molecular weight would be Y's atomic weight plus 3*19. The mass percent of F would be (3*19)/(Y + 3*19) *100 = 31.96%.

Let me calculate that. Let the atomic weight of Y be A. Then (57)/(A + 57) = 0.3196.

So 57 = 0.3196*(A +57)

57 = 0.3196A + 0.3196*57.

Calculating 0.3196*57: 0.32*57 is about 18.24, but exact value: 57 * 0.3196 = let's compute.

57 * 0.3 is 17.1, 57 *0.0196 is approx 1.1172, so total 18.2172.

So equation: 57 = 0.3196A + 18.2172.

Subtract 18.2172 from both sides: 57 -18.2172 = 0.3196A.

38.7828 = 0.3196A.

A =
