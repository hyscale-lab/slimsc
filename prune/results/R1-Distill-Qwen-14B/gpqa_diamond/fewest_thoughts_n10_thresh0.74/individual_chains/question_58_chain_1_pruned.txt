Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which of the theories doesn't require regularization at high energies. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization anyway? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like when calculations give infinite results, which are unphysical. Regularization helps make those infinities manageable so you can subtract them off or renormalize.

So, each theory's behavior at high energies would determine if it needs regularization. Let me go through each option.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics with general relativity. Strings are one-dimensional objects, vibrations of which give rise to particles. Since it incorporates gravity, it might naturally avoid some of the divergences that plague other theories. But wait, I'm not sure. I remember that string theories require certain conditions, like specific numbers of dimensions, and maybe they have issues with tachyons, but do they need regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Or maybe, because strings have higher spin or something, their perturbation series might converge better, reducing the need for regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I remember that QCD has asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, making perturbative methods valid. But wait, does QCD require regularization when dealing with certain calculations? I think because it's a non-abelian theory, it's more complicated. Also, things like confinement and the existence of things like instantons might necessitate regularization techniques. So I'm leaning towards B requiring regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I know that QED does require renormalization because of the divergences in loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy. So regularization is definitely used in QED to handle these divergences before renormalization. So C does require it.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, this is the
