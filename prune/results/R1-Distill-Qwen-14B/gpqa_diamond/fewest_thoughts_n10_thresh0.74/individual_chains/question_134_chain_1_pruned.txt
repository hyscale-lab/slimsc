Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps. Let me think.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The quantities are in mL and concentrations. So first, I probably need to figure out the moles of each acid and base present. Oh right, because the neutralization reaction depends on the mole ratio.

Wait, but wait. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they mix, they'll react. But I need to consider how they react and which ones are in excess.

Let me jot down the volumes and molarities:

HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M → Moles = 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M → Moles = 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M → Moles = 0.2 L *0.5 = 0.1 mol.

Wait, but wait. H2SO4 is diprotic, right? So each mole of H2SO4 can donate
