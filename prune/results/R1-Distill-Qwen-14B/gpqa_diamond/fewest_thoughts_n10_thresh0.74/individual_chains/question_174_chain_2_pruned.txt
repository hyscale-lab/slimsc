Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, I need to figure out the difference between the correct relativistic T1 and the classical approximation. Alright, let's break this down.

First, the problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with rest-mass energy 300 GeV. Oh wait, right, because E=mc², but since it's at rest, all its energy is rest mass. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV.

Then, it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Hmm, okay.

Let me denote the masses. Let's say the smaller fragment has mass m. Then the larger one has mass 2m. So total mass after fission is m + 2m = 3m. But the problem says 3m = 0.99 M. So M is the initial mass.

Wait, but the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, so M c² is 300 GeV. Since we're dealing with rest masses, perhaps I can ignore the c² and just work with mass in units where c=1? Or maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of mass-energy.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M. Wait, no. Wait, no, 3m = 0.99 M, so m = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M. So the smaller fragment has mass m = 0.33 M, and the larger is 0.66 M.

But wait, the problem says the initial mass is M. So the sum of the two fragments is 0.99 M. So 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M. Okay.

Now, since the nucleus was initially at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum.

Let me denote the velocities. Let me call the smaller fragment mass m, and the
