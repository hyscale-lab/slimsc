Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, excited in a specific energy level... I remember that in stars, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in a given energy state to the temperature and the energy difference between those states.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, and E is energy. Since the problem is about the ratio of excitation (n_1 / n_2 = 2), but wait here, which way is the ratio? Let me double-check. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So I think that means n1 (excited state) is twice n2 (same state). Or wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the excitation levels between the two stars. So for each star, the ratio of the excited level to the ground level or something else? Hmm, I think the question is about the ratio of the populations in a specific energy level between the two stars.

Wait, the given is that in star_1, the excited level of iron is twice as excited as in star_2. So the ratio of the number of excited atoms in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2, so (n1)/(n2) = 2. Or wait, maybe the ratio is relative to the same energy level. Let me think, the question says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J. So for each star, the energy difference is the same. So the ratio of the populations in the excited state to some other state depends on temperature.

So using the Boltzmann equation, n_i / n_j = exp(-Î”E/(kT)). Wait, assuming that the lower state is the same for both stars, so for each star, the ratio of their excited to lower state is given by their respective temperatures.

In this case, the question is comparing the two stars.
