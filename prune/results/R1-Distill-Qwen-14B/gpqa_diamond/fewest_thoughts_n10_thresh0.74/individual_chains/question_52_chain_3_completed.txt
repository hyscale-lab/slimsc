Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So, the factor would be the spotless ratio divided by the spotted ratio, I think. So that would be a number greater than 1.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (level 2 and level 1, say) is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

The problem says that the transition between these two levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. So that's emission or absorption line related to Ti atoms. Well, the wavelength relates to the energy difference between the levels because E = hc/λ. So higher wavelength means lower energy difference.

Wait, but how does that tie into the ratio? Oh right, because the exponent in the Boltzmann factor depends on the energy difference. So if the temperature changes, the ratio changes.

But wait, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So the photosphere is on average cooler, which affects the ratio of Ti atoms in different energy levels.

In the spotless case, T is 6000 K. When spotted, T drops to 5500 K. So the ratio n1/n2 (or n2/n1) will change based on the temperature.

Wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T decreases, the ratio (say n2/n1) goes down. Because higher temperatures would mean more excitation, so higher populations in higher energy levels. Wait, wait, wait: Let me think again.

In the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So higher temperature (T) makes the exponent less negative, so the ratio increases. Because exp(-x) is smaller when x is bigger. So if T increases, the exponent's denominator is larger, so the whole term is smaller negative, so the exponential is larger.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose ΔE is positive (E2 > E1), so the exponent is negative. Higher T makes the exponent less negative, so exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) increases. So n2 increases relative to n1 as T increases.

So, in the problem, when the star has spots, T goes down. So the exponent becomes more negative. So the ratio n2/n1 decreases. Which matches the observation that the ratio decreases when there are spots.

So the ratio when spotless (T=6000 K) is higher than when spotted (T=5500 K). So the factor is spotless_ratio / spotted_ratio.

Now, we need to compute this factor. Let's denote the ratio as R = (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights (g2/g1) are the same in both cases, since they are fixed for the energy levels. So the ratio R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no. Wait, R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), because the other terms (g factors) are the same in both cases, since it's the same two levels being compared.

Wait, no, wait: Let's think about what ΔE is. The energy difference between the two levels. So when T changes, the exponent changes. So R is proportional to exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, the energy levels are fixed, so E2 - E1 is a constant. So the ratio R is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, but wait, that's correct. So when T increases, the exponent's denominator is larger, so the term is smaller. So the exponential is larger because the negative is smaller.

So, the factor we're looking for is (R_spotless) / (R_spotted) = exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotless) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) )

Which simplifies to exp [ (ΔE/k) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_spotless) ) ]

Hmm, that's because 1/a - 1/b = (b - a)/(a b). Wait, let's take it step by step.

Let me write R_spotless = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotless) ), where A is (g2/g1). Similarly, R_spotted = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) )

So the ratio R_spotless/R_spotted = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotless) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ) ]

Which is exp [ (ΔE/(k)) ( 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) ) ) ]

Wait, because: exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (a) - (b) )

So in this case, a = -ΔE/(k T_spotless ), and b= -ΔE/(k T_spotted )

So a - b = [ -ΔE/(k T_spotless) ) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T_spotted) ) ] = ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) ] 

Wait, that's [ (1/Spotted) - (1/Spotless) ] multiplied by (ΔE/k )

So the exponent becomes (ΔE / k ) * (1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) )

Now, let's compute that.

But wait, what is ΔE? We're given the wavelength λ ≈ 1448 Å. So we can compute ΔE using E = hc/λ.

But wait, the energy levels are such that the transition emits or absorbs this photon. So ΔE = hc/λ.

But wait, wait, I think the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/(λ). Because when an electron transitions from E2 to E1, it emits a photon of energy ΔE = E2 - E1, which corresponds to wavelength λ = hc/(ΔE).

Wait, no, wait: E = hc/λ. So ΔE = hc/λ. So that's correct.

But wait, I should be careful with the units. Let's make sure all units are consistent.

So h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So hc/λ is (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) )

Compute that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1448e-10 = ?

Let me compute that:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448 ) * 1e-18

1.9878 / 1.448 is approximately 1.373.

So ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J per photon.

But let's compute this precisely:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

1448e-10 m is 1.448e-7 m.

So 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = (1.9878 / 1.448) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.373, so ΔE ≈ 1.373e-18 J.

But for the Boltzmann factor, we need to express this in terms of k*T.

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.38e-23 J/K.

So let's compute (ΔE)/(k) = (1.373e-18 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) ≈ (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 K ≈ approx 0.995e5 ≈ 99500 K.

Wait, wait, let me do that again.

1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5.

1.373 / 1.38 ≈ 0.995.

So 0.995 * 1e5 = 99500 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

But wait, that's a very large number. So for a typical T of a star, like 6000 K, (ΔE)/(k T) would be 99500 / 6000 ≈ 16.58.

But wait, wait, that can't be right. Because if ΔE is 10^5 K * k, then for T=6000 K, the exponent is about 16.58, but that would make the Boltzmann factor exp(-16.58) which is a very small number, like 1e-7 or something. But that doesn't make sense because I thought the transitions are in the UV, but maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think. Let me compute the energy difference again.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448e-10 meters, which is 1.448e-7 meters. So hc/λ is (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m) )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 → 1.9878 / 1.448 = approx 1.373 → 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, that's correct. So ΔE is about 1.373e-18 J.

Now, k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So (ΔE)/(k) = 1.373e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.373 / 1.38 ) * 1e5 → approx 0.995 * 1e5 → 99500 K.

So (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 9.95e4 K.

Wait, but when you compute (ΔE)/(k T), for T=6000 K, that's 9.95e4 / 6e3 ≈ 16.58.

Wait, that's a problem because that would make the exponent -16.58, which gives exp(-16.58) ≈ 5.7e-8. That's a very small number, but in reality, the number of atoms in the excited state would be negligible. But that can't be right because the problem is considering the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels, implying that both are present.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the direction of the energy levels. Because if the transition is from level 2 to level 1, emitting a photon of 1448 Å, then E2 > E1, so ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So, for a star at 6000 K, the exponent is about -16.58, but that's a huge negative number. So the ratio n2/n1 would be (g2/g1) * exp(-16.58) ≈ (g2/g1) * 5.7e-8. That seems way too small. So perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the inverse wavelength. Let me think again: the energy is proportional to 1/λ, so perhaps I got the energy difference reversed.

Wait, no, no. Let me think in terms of photon energy. The energy of the photon emitted when an electron drops from level 2 to level 1 is E_photon = E2 - E1 = hc/λ. So that's correct.

Wait, but if the star's temperature is lower than the energy of the transition, which is about 99,500 K, then perhaps the level is mostly populated in the lower state. Wait, but the star's Teff is 6000 K, which is way lower than 99500 K. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -99500 /6000 ) = exp( -16.58 ) ≈ 5.7e-8, which is a very small number. So n2 is much smaller than n1, which would make sense. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So let's proceed.

So (ΔE)/(k) is 99500 K.

But wait, in our case, the factor we're calculating for the ratio R_spotless/R_spotted is:

exp [ (ΔE/k) ( 1/(T_spotted) - 1/(T_spotless) ) ) ]

Because R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so R_spotless/R_spotted = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T_spotted - 1/T_spotless) )

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

T_spotless = 6000 K, T_spotted =5500 K.

Compute 1/T_spotted = 1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1.

1/T_spotless = 1/6000 ≈ 1.667e-4 K^-1.

So 1/T_spotted - 1/T_spotless = (1.818e-4 - 1.667e-4 ) → 0.151e-4 → 1.51e-5 K^-1.

ΔE/(k) is 9.95e4 K.

So multiply them: 9.95e4 K * 1.51e-5 K^-1 = ?

Compute 9.95e4 * 1.51e-5 → (9.95 * 1.51) * 1e-1 → approximately 15.0 * 0.1 → 1.5.

Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately.

9.95e4 is 99500.

1.51e-5 is 0.0000151.

Multiply them: 99500 * 0.0000151 = ?

Well, 99500 * 0.00001 = 0.995.

And 99500 * 0.0000051 = 0.50745.

Adding together, 0.995 + 0.50745 = 1.50245.

So approximately 1.502.

So the exponent is 1.502.

Thus, the factor is exp(1.502) ≈ e^1.502.

We know that e^1 ≈ 2.718, e^1.5 ≈ 4.4817, e^1.6 ≈ 4.953. Hmm, wait, let me compute e^1.502 accurately.

We can think of it as e^(1.5) ≈4.4817. Let's compute e^0.002.

e^0.002 is approximately 1 + 0.002 + (0.002)^2/2 ≈ 1.002002.

So e^1.502 = e^1.5 * e^0.002 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.002002 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.002 ≈ 4.492.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should use a calculator value. Alternatively, I know that ln(7.8) is around 2.05, but perhaps I should just go with the approximate value.

Wait, but the exponent is 1.502, so e^1.502 is approximately 4.49.

But wait, let me check with more precise calculation. Alternatively, if I have to pick from the given options, and the options given are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9, then option C is ~4.5, which is very close to our approximation of 4.49.

So the factor is approximately 4.5. So the ratio when the star is spotless is about 4.5 times higher than when it's spotted.

So the answer would be option C.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star transitions from being spotless (Teff = 6000 K) to having spots (Teff = 5500 K), we use the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights of the energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spotless}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{spotted}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}}\right)\right).
\]

### Step 1: Compute \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\Delta E / k\)
Boltzmann's constant is \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23}} \approx 99500 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the temperature terms
The temperatures are \(T_{\text{spotless}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\) and \(T_{\text{spotted}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\). Compute:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 1.818 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}} = (1.818 \times 10^{-4} - 1.667 \times 10^{-4}) \approx 1.51 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the exponent
Multiply \(\Delta E / k\) with the temperature term:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{spotted}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{spotless}}}\right) = (99500)(1.51 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 1.502.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.502) \approx 4.49.
\]

### Step 6: Match with the options
The closest option to the computed factor is **C) ~4.5**.

Answer: C
