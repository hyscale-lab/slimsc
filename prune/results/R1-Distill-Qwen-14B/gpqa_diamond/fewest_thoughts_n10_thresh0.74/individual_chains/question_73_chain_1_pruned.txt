Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, let me see. I've studied some relativity before, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds, right? Because of the velocity addition formula. Oh right, when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities normally. I remember that the formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). But wait, which direction are they moving in? Since both are in the positive x-direction, the relative speed would be the difference. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's velocity?

Wait, no, actually, the problem says "relative speed" between them. So one is moving faster than the other. So from A's perspective, what speed is B moving at? Or wait, maybe the question is asking for the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. Because if both are moving in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, so v_rel would be (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c²) ) = (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c/(0.7) ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. But wait, that's the speed of B as seen from A's frame. Alternatively, the relative speed between them could be that.

Now looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part.

Next, the total energy. The system's total energy would be the sum of each
