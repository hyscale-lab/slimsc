Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I remember that ethan-1-one is an acetophenone derivative, so I think that's where the ketone comes from.

Hmm, the target molecule has substituents on the benzene ring: a bromo group and a nitro group. Plus, the ketone is attached. Wait, the structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which means the phenyl group has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, making the substituents 3 and 5 on the ring. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I think the numbering is a bit different. Let me sketch the structure quickly. The phenyl ring has a ketone group (from ethan-1-one) attached to carbon 1. Then, positions 3 and 5 have Br and nitro groups. So the substituents are meta to each other on the benzene ring.

So the starting material is benzene, and we need to add these substituents in the correct order to get the right positions. I remember that when adding substituents, the directing groups on the ring will determine where the next substituent goes. Also, the order in which we add the substituents matters because activating and deactivating groups will influence where the next substitution occurs.

Nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. Bromine is a deactivating, ortho/para director. Acetophenone (the ketone) is a deactivating, meta director as well.

Wait, but wait: the directing effects. Let's think about each step.

I need to plan the steps to get the substituents in the correct positions. Let me think about the substituents: the ring has a ketone, a bromine, and a nitro group. So the goal is to have the ketone, bromine, and nitro in positions 1, 3, and 5 respectively.

Wait, wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged as the ketone at position 1, nitro at 5,
