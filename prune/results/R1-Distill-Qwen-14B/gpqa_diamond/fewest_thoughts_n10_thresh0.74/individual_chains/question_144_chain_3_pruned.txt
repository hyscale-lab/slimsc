Okay, I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

So the question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are various distances in meters, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Wait, I remember that when a particle is produced, its mean lifetime is related to its decay width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ, but wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Because the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but for a particle, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy ΔE. So Γ ≈ ħ / τ, meaning τ ≈ ħ / Γ. That makes sense because a larger width (so more uncertain energy) would mean a shorter lifetime.

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ, then use that to find the decay distance. But wait, the decay distance depends on the particle's speed and lifetime. The mean decay distance L is given by L = v * τ, right? Because the particle moves at velocity v for time τ before decaying.

But wait, the velocity of the meson X depends on its energy and mass. Hmm, how do I calculate it? I think I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². So I can solve for p first.

Wait, but the units here are in GeV and MeV. Oh wait, E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV (which is 1200 MeV), and Γ is 320 MeV. So all units should be consistent. Maybe I should convert everything to the same unit, like MeV.

Wait, let me make sure. E_X
