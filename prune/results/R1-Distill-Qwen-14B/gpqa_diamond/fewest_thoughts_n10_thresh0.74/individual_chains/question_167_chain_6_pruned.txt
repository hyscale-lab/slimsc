Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

So the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. And N is the normalization constant sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Here, rho is the density matrix of the state, and tau is that of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait. I remember that Gaussian states are states whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. The cat states are highly non-Gaussian, especially for large alpha. So the question is about how non-Gaussian this particular state is.

I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (RNG) is a measure that quantifies how different a state is from any Gaussian state. So if the state is Gaussian, the RNG should be zero. Since cat states are non-Gaussian, the RNG should be positive.

But wait, the state given here is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is not. So the state is non-Gaussian. But how does that translate into the RNG?

Wait, the relative entropy measure compares the state's entropy to the entropy of the closest Gaussian state. But calculating that seems difficult. Oh wait, maybe the problem is simplified. Let's think about the specific case when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

First, I can plug in the numbers. Let's compute N. N squared is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²).

Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N squared is 1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2). Exp(-2*(0.25)) is exp(-0.5), which is about 0.6065. So N² = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/N.

Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |−0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, so the density matrix rho for this state would be |psi><psi|. Because it's
