Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember that when something absorbs a certain wavelength of light, it emits the complementary color. Wait, complementary, right? Like, if it absorbs blue, it reflects yellow, so we see it as yellow.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, no, wait. When a material absorbs light, it's usually because the energy transitions an electron to a higher energy level. Then, when the electron drops back down, it emits a photon with that energy. So the emitted light's energy corresponds to the energy gap the electron jumped.

So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. I think I can use the equation E = hc/λ to find the wavelength. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and E is energy.

Wait, what's the value of hc? I remember it's approximately 1240 eV·nm. So if E is 2.3393 eV, then λ = hc/E. So plugging in the numbers: 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ let's calculate that.

Let me do the division: 1240 divided by 2.3393. 2.3393 is about 2.34. So 1240 / 2.34 is roughly... Hmm, 1240 divided by 2 is 620, but 2.34 is a bit bigger. So maybe around 530 nm? Because 2.34 times 530 is 1240.2. Oh, that's close. So the wavelength is approximately 530 nm.

What color is 530 nm? I think green is around there. Wait, the visible spectrum goes from violet (400-450) to red (620-700), with green in the middle. So 530 is in the green range. But wait, the question is about the color absorbed, not emitted. Oh right, because when the dye absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits the complementary color.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the dye emits light when it drops back. So the emitted light is 530 nm, which is green. That means the dye absorbed a photon of a certain energy, then emitted a photon of 2.33
