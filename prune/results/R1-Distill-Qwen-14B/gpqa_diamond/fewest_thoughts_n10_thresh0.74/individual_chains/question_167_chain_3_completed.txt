Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/ N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha =0.5. 

The question is asking for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula provided is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Here, tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state, and rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state.

Wait a second, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those that can be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states or squeezed states. Schrödinger cat states are superpositions of such states and are highly non-Gaussian.

I remember that one of the ways to calculate non-Gaussianity is through the use of relative entropy compared to a Gaussian state. So del_b is the relative entropy between the non-Gaussian state and the Gaussian reference.

But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Oh, right, sometimes the reference is taken as the closest Gaussian state to the given state. Alternatively, maybe it's the state that maximizes the entropy among Gaussian states with the same first and second moments. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the completely mixed Gaussian state or another specific one. But the problem says tau is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state. So I think I need to figure out what tau is in this case.

Alternatively, maybe the relative entropy is calculated with respect to a specific Gaussian state. For the cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the Gaussian reference could be the maximally mixed Gaussian state, or perhaps a coherent state itself. Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the thermal state. Hmm, not sure. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe I need to find a standard approach.

Wait, but I think in the case of a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the Gaussian reference state might be the state that minimizes the distance (in terms of entropy) to the non-Gaussian state. Or perhaps it's the closest Gaussian state in some metric.

Alternatively, I've heard that for the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity, the reference is taken as the closest Gaussian state to the given state. So, perhaps the procedure is to find the Gaussian state tau that minimizes the relative entropy with rho, and then compute the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy.

But wait, the formula given is del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)], where S is the von Neumann entropy. Since von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho ln rho), the formula is as given.

So, the first step would be to construct the density matrix rho of the given state, and then find the reference Gaussian state tau. Then compute the entropy of rho and tau, and subtract.

But how do I find tau? Well, the problem says that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps for the given state, the closest Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the Schrödinger cat state is a specific type of non-Gaussian state, and perhaps the relative entropy is calculated with respect to the thermal state or a coherent state. Alternatively, sometimes the reference is the vacuum or a coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is calculated with respect to the closest Gaussian state. So, tau would be the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in terms of the quantum relative entropy.

But I'm getting stuck on what tau is. Let me think about the structure of the state.

The given state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. For phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So |psi> is (sqrt(2)/2)(|alpha> - |-alpha> ) / N. The normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

Plugging phi = -pi/4 into sin(2phi): sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N is sqrt(1 + (-1)* exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Compute that: exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 0.3935. So N = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is approximately (0.7071 / 0.6275) (|alpha> - |-alpha> ). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

But the density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|.

The problem is that to compute rho's entropy, I need the eigenvalues of rho. But since rho is a pure state (since |psi> is a pure state), the entropy S(rho) is zero because rho is a pure state. Wait, no: because von Neumann entropy is zero for a pure state. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait no, rho is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. But wait, that can't be right because the formula is S(rho) - S(tau). If rho is pure, then S(rho)=0. So del_b would be - S(tau), which can't be right because del_b is supposed to measure non-Gaussianity, which is a positive quantity.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The relative entropy is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Wait, if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero. So del_b would be negative of S(tau), but non-Gaussianity is a positive measure. Hmm, this suggests I might have the formula wrong, or perhaps tau is the state that rho is compared to.

Wait, maybe the formula is the other way around. Sometimes relative entropy is defined as S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Oh wait, the problem states del_b is [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. So it's S(rho) - S(tau).

So if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0. So del_b = - S(tau). But then del_b would be negative, which doesn't make sense for a non-Gaussianity measure, which should be positive. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is actually S(tau) - S(rho), but the problem states the other way. Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think again: relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is often defined as the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So if rho is non-Gaussian, then the minimal relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state tau is S(rho||tau). But the formula given here is S(rho) - S(tau), which is different.

Wait, the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is usually S(rho) - S(tau), but only if tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. So perhaps in this case, the minimal S(rho||tau) is being considered, but the formula given is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the Bures measure or something else. Wait, but the question says the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, but for a pure state, S(rho) is zero, so del_b would be - S(tau), which would be negative. But non-Gaussianity is a positive measure, so this suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is actually the other way around: del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). Then, if rho is non-pure, which it's not in this case because rho is pure (since |psi> is a pure state), S(rho) is zero, so del_b would be S(tau). But that would be S(tau) being the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but in this problem, |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. So del_b would be - S(tau), which would be negative. But non-Gaussianity is a positive quantity, so perhaps the problem actually has the formula as S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive.

Hmm, perhaps the question has a typo, but I'll proceed with the formula as given.

Wait, another thought: maybe the state is mixed. Wait, |psi> is a pure state. So rho is pure, and S(rho)=0. Then del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that would imply that del_b is negative, which doesn't make sense for non-Gaussianity. So perhaps I'm missing a step. Or perhaps the problem is actually using the relative entropy in a different way.

Wait, maybe the reference state tau is the maximally mixed Gaussian state. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the state obtained by taking the partial trace over some other system, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the given state is a pure state, so the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau would be positive. But according to the formula, del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), which would be 0 - S(tau), which is negative. So this can't be right. Therefore, perhaps the formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive.

But I need to proceed with what's given. So perhaps the problem is designed differently.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the state that when rho is a Gaussian state, tau equals rho, so that del_b would be zero. So for a non-Gaussian state, del_b would be positive because S(rho) is higher than S(tau). Wait, but for a pure state, S(rho)=0. So if the reference state is more mixed, then S(tau) would be higher, so del_b would be negative. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually using the relative entropy of rho with respect to tau, which is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). In that case, if rho is pure, which it is, then S(rho||tau) would be S(rho) - S(tau) + [Tr(rho ln tau) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. Hmm, no, wait: the formula is as stated.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau, and see which is bigger.

Wait, but rho is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. So the formula would yield del_b = 0 - S(tau). So if tau is a mixed state, S(tau) is positive, so del_b is negative. But that's not possible for a non-Gaussianity measure. So perhaps the formula is actually S(tau) - S(rho), which would be S(tau), and that's the non-Gaussianity. But then, for a Gaussian state, the non-Gaussianity would be zero. Wait, but for a Gaussian state, rho would be Gaussian, so S(rho)=S(tau), so del_b would be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong, and the correct non-Gaussianity measure is S(tau) - S(rho). But according to the problem statement, the formula is S(rho) - S(tau), which for a pure state would be negative, which can't be correct. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is, and for a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the reference Gaussian state is the state obtained by taking the expectation values of the non-Gaussian state. So for example, the Gaussian state tau would have the same first and second moments as rho.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the Gaussian state tau is the maximum entropy Gaussian state consistent with the first and second moments of rho.

But how would I compute that?

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum state. But in this case, the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, so the vacuum might not be the right reference.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the density matrix of the state, then find its entropy, find the entropy of a reference Gaussian state, and compute the difference.

Wait, but rho is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. So according to the formula, del_b = 0 - S(tau), which is negative. But non-Gaussianity is a positive measure, so that suggests that perhaps the formula is actually S(tau) - S(rho), which would be S(tau) in this case.

But without knowing what tau is, I can't compute it. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that rho would be if it were Gaussian. But for a cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, the state is non-Gaussian, so the closest Gaussian state would have the same first and second moments. Let me think.

The first moment is the expectation value of the annihilation operator. For rho, which is |psi><psi|, the expectation value <a> would be [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N multiplied by the bra. Wait, actually, let's compute <a> for the state |psi>. 

The coherent state |alpha> has expectation value <a> = alpha. Similarly, |-alpha> has <a> = -alpha.

So the state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

The expectation value <a> is (cos^2(phi) alpha + sin^2(phi)(-alpha)) / N^2.

Wait, because |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N, so taking the expectation value:

<psi|a|psi> = [ (cos(phi)* <alpha| + sin(phi)* < -alpha | ) / N ] a [ (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N ]

Expanding this, the cross terms would involve <alpha| a | - alpha >. 

But <alpha| a | - alpha > is (alpha)* (-alpha) e^{2i phi}? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute <a> for |psi>.

Wait, another approach: since the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, the expectation value of a would be ( |cos(phi)|^2 alpha + |sin(phi)|^2 (-alpha) ) plus some cross terms.

Wait, but |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Their inner product is exp( - |alpha|^2 - | - alpha |^2 + alpha (-alpha)^* + (-alpha) alpha^* )? Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute <alpha|a| - alpha> as follows.

The inner product <alpha|a| - alpha> is alpha * (-alpha) e^{2i alpha (-alpha)} ? Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, consider that a|beta> = beta |beta>, where |beta> is a coherent state. So, <gamma| a |beta> = gamma^* beta e^{-(gamma beta^*)} ? Hmm, I'm a bit unsure. Let me think. For coherent states, the inner product <gamma|a|beta> is given by:

<gamma|a|beta> = a <gamma|beta> = a e^{- (|gamma|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + gamma^* beta} }.

So, for gamma = alpha and beta = -alpha, we have:

<alpha | a | -alpha> = a e^{ -( |alpha|^2 + | - alpha |^2 )/2 + alpha^* (-alpha) }.

Wait, |alpha| and |-alpha| are the same, so |alpha|^2 = |-alpha|^2. Let me compute the exponent:

-( |alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2 )/2 + alpha^*(-alpha) ) = -(2 |alpha|^2)/2 + (- |alpha|^2) ) = - |alpha|^2 - |alpha|^2 = -2 |alpha|^2.

So, <alpha | a | -alpha> = a e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

Wait, a is the annihilation operator. So, <alpha | a | -alpha> = alpha^* (-alpha) e^{-2 |alpha|^2} ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The coherent state is |alpha> = e^{-|alpha|^2/2} sum (alpha^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>. So, the inner product <alpha| a |beta> is given by e^{-|alpha|^2/2 - |beta|^2/2} sum [ alpha^*^n (a beta^n)/sqrt(n!)} ].

But a |beta> = beta |beta>, so a beta^n |n> = beta^{n} |n>, so <alpha| a |beta> = e^{- (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} sum [ (alpha^* )^n beta^{n} / sqrt(n! ) ].

Which is e^{- (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} sum [ (alpha^* beta )^n / sqrt(n! ) ].

But sum [ (alpha^* beta )^n / sqrt(n! ) ] is e^{ (alpha^* beta ) }.

So, <alpha| a |beta> = e^{- (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2} e^{ alpha^* beta }.

So for beta = -alpha, we have:

<alpha | a | -alpha> = e^{ - (|alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2 ) /2 } * e^{ alpha^* (-alpha) } 

= e^{-|alpha|^2} e^{- |alpha|^2} (since alpha^* (-alpha) = - |alpha|^2 )

Wait, no. Wait, alpha^* (-alpha) is -(alpha^* alpha) = -|alpha|^2. So,

= e^{-|alpha|^2} * e^{-|alpha|^2} = e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

But <alpha| a | -alpha> = e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

So, back to computing <a> for |psi>.

< a > = [ (cos(phi) <alpha| + sin(phi) < -alpha | ) / N ] * [ (cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) / N ] * a

Expanding this, it's [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha | a | alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a |-alpha> ] / N^2.

But <alpha| a | alpha> = alpha, since |alpha> is a coherent state. Similarly, < -alpha | a | -alpha> = -alpha.

The cross terms: <alpha| a |-alpha> is e^{-2 |alpha|^2 }, as we found earlier. Similarly, < -alpha | a | alpha> = e^{-2 |alpha|^2}.

So putting it all together:

< a > = [ cos^2(phi) * alpha + cos(phi) sin(phi) * e^{-2 |alpha|^2 } + sin(phi) cos(phi) * e^{-2 |alpha|^2 } + sin^2(phi) * (-alpha) ] / N^2.

Simplify:

= [ alpha (cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) ) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) e^{-2 |alpha|^2 } ] / N^2.

But since 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) = sin(2 phi), and cos^2(phi) - sin^2(phi) = cos(2 phi).

So < a > = [ alpha cos(2 phi) + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 |alpha|^2 } ] / N^2.

Similarly, the variance would involve <a^2> and <a>^2.

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should compute <a> and the second moments to find the closest Gaussian state tau.

Wait, but perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments as rho. So the Gaussian state tau would have the same <a> and <a^2> as rho.

In that case, the Gaussian state tau would be a displaced squeezed state, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coherent state if the squeezing parameter is zero. But how to find that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first and second moments, and the maximum entropy. For such a state, the entropy would be given by the von Neumann entropy of the Gaussian state, which can be determined from its covariance matrix.

But I'm not sure about the exact steps to find the entropy of tau, given the moments of rho.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian, but that can't be right because the Schrödinger cat state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but wait, wait. The given state is a superposition of two coherent states. So, it's definitely a non-Gaussian state. So the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But according to the formula given, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). If rho is pure, then S(rho)=0. So del_b would be - S(tau), which is negative. So perhaps the formula is actually S(tau) - S(rho), which would give a positive value.

Assuming that, then del_b would be S(tau) - 0 = S(tau).

So, to find the non-Gaussianity, I need to compute S(tau), the von Neumann entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But how?

Well, for a single-mode Gaussian state, the von Neumann entropy can be calculated based on the parameters of the state. For example, for a squeezed state, the entropy depends on the squeezing. For a coherent state, the entropy is zero (since it's pure). For a thermal state, the entropy is S = 1 - ( (n+1)/(n+2) ) ln( (n+1)/(n+2) ) - (1/(n+2)) ln(1/(n+2)) ), where n is the average photon number.

But wait, in this problem, I don't know what the reference Gaussian state is. So perhaps I need to compute the state tau that is the closest Gaussian state to rho in terms of the relative entropy.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, I can't compute S(tau).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that for this specific state, the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that can't be, since it's a cat state.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the relative entropy given is between the state rho and the completely mixed Gaussian state. For example, the maximally mixed Gaussian state would have the maximum entropy among all single-mode Gaussian states. Its density matrix would be the identity matrix scaled by 1/2, perhaps. Wait, the single-mode maximally mixed Gaussian state is actually a thermal state with infinite temperature, which would correspond to the vacuum plus some offset.

But perhaps I'm complicating it too much. Alternatively, perhaps the reference tau is the vacuum state, but the given state |psi> is not the vacuum, so S(tau) would be zero (if tau is the vacuum, but that's a pure state, so S(tau)=0).

Wait, no. The vacuum state has S=0. If tau is the vacuum, then del_b would be S(rho) - 0. But rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. So del_b=0. But that can't be right for a non-Gaussian state.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is a bit of a trick question. If the state is a pure state, then it's non-Gaussian, but the relative entropy as defined would be zero minus the entropy of a Gaussian state. But if the Gaussian state has higher entropy, that would give a negative del_b, which isn't meaningful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the formula is actually the other way around, giving a positive del_b. If so, then the non-Gaussianity would be S(tau) - S(rho) = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). So I need to find S(tau), the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state that would have the same first and second moments as rho. So, to find tau, I compute <a> and <a²> for rho, and then construct a Gaussian state with the same <a> and <a²>, and compute its entropy.

So, let's compute <a> and <a²> for rho.

First, compute <a> as we started before.

Given phi = -pi/4, and alpha = 0.5.

Compute N: N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )).

As before, phi=-pi/4, so 2phi = -pi/2. sin(2phi) = -1. alpha=0.5, so exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=exp(-0.5)=≈0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - 1 * 0.6065 )= sqrt(0.3935)≈0.6275.

Now, compute <a>:

< a > = [ alpha cos(2 phi) + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha² } ] / N².

Wait, 2 phi is -pi/2. So cos(2 phi)=0. Sin(2 phi)=-1.

So <a> = [ alpha * 0 + (-1) * e^{-2*(0.5)^2} ] / N²

= [ - e^{-0.5} ] / (0.3935)

Because N^2 is 0.3935.

Wait, e^{-0.5}≈0.6065.

So <a> ≈ ( -0.6065 ) / 0.3935 ≈ -1.5407.

So <a>≈-1.5407.

Now compute <a²>.

Hmm, <a²> is more involved. For a single-mode state, the second moment can be found via.

But perhaps I should compute it directly. So,

<a²> = Tr( rho a a )

Which can be written as (1/N²) [ cos^2(phi) <alpha| a² |alpha> + cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| a² |-alpha> + sin(phi) cos(phi) < -alpha| a² |alpha> + sin^2(phi) < -alpha | a² |-alpha> ].

Compute each term:

1. <alpha|a²|alpha> = alpha^2.

Because a² |alpha> = alpha^2 |alpha>.

2. <alpha|a² |-alpha> = <alpha| a² | -alpha > = ?

We can compute this using the same method as before. The inner product <alpha| a² |beta> can be found, but it's more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or so.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the expression for <alpha | a² | beta> in terms of their parameters.

I think the formula is <alpha| a² |beta> = e^{ - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 } e^{ alpha^* beta } (alpha^* beta + alpha^* beta e^{ - (alpha^* beta) } )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the expansion. Let me try.

a² |beta> = a (a |beta> ) = a (beta |beta> ) = beta a |beta> = beta (beta |beta> ) = beta^2 |beta>.

So, <alpha| a² |beta> = <alpha| beta^2 |beta> = beta^2 <alpha|beta> .

But <alpha|beta> = e^{- (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 } e^{ alpha^* beta }.

So,

<alpha | a² | beta> = beta^2 e^{ - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 } e^{ alpha^* beta }.

So for beta = -alpha,

<alpha| a² |-alpha> = (-alpha)^2 e^{ - (|alpha|^2 + |alpha|^2)/2 } e^{ alpha^* (-alpha) }.

= alpha^2 e^{- |alpha|^2 } e^{ - |alpha|^2 }.

= alpha^2 e^{ - 2 |alpha|^2 }.

Similarly, < -alpha | a² | alpha> = (alpha)^2 e^{ -2 |alpha|^2 }.

So putting it all together, the four terms in <a²> are:

1. cos^2(phi) * alpha^2 
2. cos(phi) sin(phi) * [ (-alpha)^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] 
3. sin(phi) cos(phi) * [ alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] 
4. sin^2(phi) * (-alpha)^2 

= [ cos^2(phi) alpha^2 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin^2(phi) alpha^2 ] / N^2.

Simplify:

= [ alpha^2 ( cos^2(phi) + sin^2(phi) ) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Since cos^2 + sin^2 =1:

= [ alpha^2 (1) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

And 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) = sin(2 phi).

So,

< a² > = [ alpha^2 + sin(2 phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Substituting the values:

phi = -pi/4, alpha=0.5.

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2)= -1.

So,

< a² > = [ (0.5)^2 + (-1) (0.5)^2 e^{-2*(0.5)^2} ] / (0.3935).

Compute each term:

(0.5)^2 = 0.25.

e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065.

So,

= [ 0.25 + (-1)(0.25)(0.6065) ] / 0.3935.

= [ 0.25 - 0.1516 ] / 0.3935.

= (0.0984) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.2500.

So, <a²> ≈0.25.

Wait, that's interesting. So <a²> is 0.25.

The variance of a is <a²> - <a>^2.

So, Var(a) = 0.25 - ( (-1.5407 )^2 ) ≈ 0.25 - (2.373) ≈ -2.123. Which is negative, which is impossible. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, this suggests that I made a mistake in the calculation of <a²>.

Wait, let me recompute <a²>.

Wait, I have <a²> = [ alpha^2 + sin(2 phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha²} ] / N².

Substituting phi=-pi/4, alpha=0.5.

sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So,

= [0.25 + (-1)*0.25 * e^{-0.5} ] / (0.3935)

= [0.25 - 0.25 * 0.6065 ] / 0.3935

= [0.25 - 0.1516 ] / 0.3935

= (0.0984) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.25.

So <a²> ≈0.25.

But <a> was approximately -1.5407.

So <a>^2 = (approx) (-1.5407)^2 ≈ 2.373.

So Var(a) = 0.25 - 2.373 ≈ -2.123, which is negative. That's impossible, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of <a>. Let me recheck.

Earlier, I computed <a> as:

< a > = [ alpha cos(2 phi) + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N².

phi = -pi/4.

2 phi = -pi/2 → cos(2 phi)=0, sin(2 phi)=-1.

So,

< a > = [ alpha * 0 + (-1) * e^{-2 alpha^2 } ] / N^2.

alpha=0.5, so e^{-2*(0.5)^2}=e^{-0.5}=0.6065.

N^2= 0.3935.

So,

< a > = ( -0.6065 ) / 0.3935 ≈ -1.5407.

Hmm, that seems correct.

But then <a²> is 0.25, while <a>^2 is about 2.373, which would make the variance negative. That's impossible because variances can't be negative.

So I must have made a mistake in computing <a²>.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let me recompute <a²>.

The expression for <a²> is:

[ alpha^2 + sin(2 phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Wait, no, no. Wait, earlier when I computed <a²>, I have:

< a² > = [ alpha^2 + sin(2 phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Wait, no, that can't be right because when I have the cross terms, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me recompute <a²>.

rho is |psi><psi|, so the expectation value <a²> is Tr( rho a² ), which is (1/N²) [ <alpha | a² | alpha> cos²(phi) + <alpha|a²| -alpha> cos(phi) sin(phi) + < -alpha| a² | alpha> sin(phi) cos(phi) + < -alpha |a²| -alpha> sin²(phi) ].

So each term:

1. <alpha|a²|alpha> = alpha².

2. <alpha|a²|-alpha> = (-alpha)^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} = alpha² e^{-2 alpha^2}.

3. < -alpha | a² | alpha> = (alpha)^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}.

4. < -alpha |a²| -alpha> = (-alpha)^2 = alpha^2.

So,

< a² > = [ cos²(phi) alpha² + cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha² e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin(phi) cos(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} + sin²(phi) alpha² ] / N².

Which simplifies to:

= [ alpha^2 ( cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) ) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Which is:

= [ alpha^2 (1) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Now, substituting phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = -1, alpha=0.5.

So,

= [ (0.25) * 1 + ( (-1) ) * (0.25) * e^{-0.5} ] / 0.3935.

= [ 0.25 - 0.25 * 0.6065 ] / 0.3935.

= (0.25 - 0.1516 ) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.0984 / 0.3935 ≈ 0.25.

So <a²> ≈0.25.

But then, <a> ≈-1.5407, so <a>² ≈2.373.

So, Var(a)=0.25 - 2.373 = -2.123, which is impossible. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated N.

Wait, let me recheck N.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha^2 )).

phi = -pi/4 → 2 phi = -pi/2 → sin(2 phi)= -1.

alpha=0.5 → 2 alpha^2 = 0.5 → exp(-0.5)=0.6065.

So,

N = sqrt(1 + (-1)(0.6065 )) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross terms. Let me recheck.

Wait, the cross terms in <a²> involve <alpha|a²| -alpha> and < -alpha | a² | alpha> which both evaluate to alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So for the cross terms, it's 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}.

But wait, cos(phi) sin(phi) is (1/2) sin(2 phi). So, in the calculation:

2 * cos(phi) sin(phi) = sin(2 phi).

So, the cross terms contribute sin(2 phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}.

In our case, sin(2 phi)=-1, so the cross terms are - alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So in the expression:

< a² > = [ alpha^2 + sin(2 phi) alpha^2 e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Substituting, we have:

[ (0.25) + (-1)(0.25)(0.6065) ] / 0.3935.

= [ 0.25 - 0.1516 ] / 0.3935.

= 0.0984 / 0.3935 ≈0.25.

So, seems correct.

Hmm, but then Var(a)= <a²> - <a>^2 = 0.25 - ( (-1.5407)^2 )= 0.25 - 2.373 → negative.

That can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of <a>.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign in <a>.

Let me recompute <a>:

< a > = [ alpha cos(2 phi) + sin(2 phi) e^{-2 alpha^2} ] / N^2.

Wait, cos(2 phi) is cos(-pi/2) = 0.

sin(2 phi)=sin(-pi/2)=-1.

So,

< a > = [ 0 + (-1) e^{-0.5} ] / (0.3935).

= (-0.6065) / 0.3935 ≈ -1.5407.

So that's correct.

But then, the variance is negative. That can't be. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption about the moments.

Wait, perhaps the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but the moments should be computed correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the state isn't normalized correctly. Let me recheck the normalization.

Wait, N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha^2 )).

For phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, we have:

N = sqrt(1 + (-1) exp( -0.5 )) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935)≈0.6275.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the state isn't correctly written. Let me double-check the given state.

The state is |psi> = ( cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |−alpha> ) / N.

Wait, perhaps it's cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |−alpha> ), but perhaps it's actually (|alpha> + e^{i phi} |−alpha> ) or something like that. Because otherwise, for phi=-pi/4, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with equal amplitudes, but with a negative sign.

Wait, but the way it's written, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state is ( |alpha> - |-alpha> ) multiplied by sqrt(2)/2 / N.

Hmm, perhaps the issue lies elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the state is not correctly normalized for the given parameters, leading to negative variance.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.

Since the problem is a multiple-choice question and the options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

Option D is zero, which would imply that the non-Gaussianity is zero. But the state is a cat state, so it's non-Gaussian. So option D is probably incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero if the state is Gaussian, but the given state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. So options A, B, C.

But without knowing the correct method to compute S(tau), I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about whether the state is Gaussian or not.

Wait, but the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian. Their superposition is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

So, perhaps the correct answer is not D. So why would the non-Gaussianity be zero?

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy is zero because the state rho is Gaussian, but that's not true. So I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be written as a Gaussian state, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the state is a squeezed state or a displaced thermal state. Wait, but a squeezed state would typically be a superposition of two coherent states that are complex conjugates, but in this case, it's |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are real and negative.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is actually a Gaussian state. Wait, no, a superposition of coherent states is non-Gaussian.

I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

But wait, another thought: perhaps for a certain choice of phi and alpha, the state becomes Gaussian. Like, if phi is 0, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, it's |-alpha>, which is Gaussian. So for phi =-pi/4, perhaps the state is non-Gaussian, but perhaps under some circumstances, it's Gaussian.

Wait, but in this case, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are two different coherent states. Hence, the state is non-Gaussian.

So, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. So options A, B, C.

But without knowing the exact method, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the non-Gaussianity is zero. But why?

Wait, perhaps N is zero. Let me check when N is zero. N is zero when the denominator is zero.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha^2 )).

So, 1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha^2 ) =0.

That would require sin(2 phi)= -1 / exp( -2 alpha^2 )= exp( 2 alpha^2 ).

But exp(2 alpha^2 ) is always >=1, so sin(2 phi) <=1. So, for this to be zero, we need exp(2 alpha^2 ) = -1, which is impossible. So N is always non-zero.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is a product state and the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state, leading to zero non-Gaussianity. But that can't be, because the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different measure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a cat state, which is a minimum uncertainty state, but that's not true. Cat states have superposed coherent states and have large uncertainty.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have del_b=0 because the relative entropy is symmetric, but that's not the case as rho and tau are different.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler than I'm making it. The state is psi=(|alpha> - |-alpha>)/ sqrt(2) when N=1. But in our case, N is not 1.

Wait, but N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp( -2 alpha^2 )).

With phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, as before, N≈0.6275.

So, the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, weighted by sqrt(2)/2 / N.

But perhaps the relative entropy is zero because the state is Gaussian. No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is a Gaussian state, and hence the non-Gaussianity is zero. But I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state. No, because it's a superposition of two different coherent states.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the Wigner function of the state. A coherent state has a Gaussian Wigner function. A superposition of two coherent states has a non-Gaussian Wigner function, like two peaks, hence non-Gaussian.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But the options are A)2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C)1.38.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a product state, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually that the state is a cat state, which is a non-Gaussian state, but when calculating the relative entropy compared to a Gaussian state, the entropy difference is positive. But without knowing how to compute S(tau), I can't find the value.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the vacuum. But then S(tau)=0 because the vacuum is a pure state. So del_b would be 0 - 0 =0, which would be option D. But that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed state, which for a single mode would have the maximum entropy among single-mode Gaussian states. The entropy of such a state would be 1 (in natural units?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, the von Neumann entropy of a maximally mixed state is ln(d), where d is the dimension. For a single mode, d approaches infinity. So the entropy would approach infinity. But that's not practical.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state with the same first and second moments as rho. But earlier, I found that <a> is about -1.54 and <a²> is 0.25. So, the Gaussian state would have these moments.

But for a single-mode Gaussian state, the Wigner function is determined by its first and second moments. The entropy of such a Gaussian state can be computed using the formula for the entropy of a squeezed state or a displaced thermal state.

Wait, for a single-mode Gaussian state, the von Neumann entropy is given by S = (1 + ln(2)) [ (n+1) ln(2) - ... ] Hmm, perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, the entropy of a single-mode Gaussian state is S = ln(2) if the state is a coherent state, because for a coherent state, the entropy is zero, but wait, no—coherent states are pure, so S=0.

Wait, perhaps for a displaced thermal state, the entropy is S = (1 + ln(2)) [ (n+1) ln(2) - ... ].

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps instead of trying to compute it, I should think about the fact that the given state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is known to have high non-Gaussianity.

But looking at the options, perhaps the correct non-Gaussianity is 1.38, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 0, but that would imply the state is Gaussian, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in calculating the moments. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the state is a product state, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state can be written as a Gaussian state. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed in such a way that the non-Gaussianity is zero. For example, when the state is a coherent state, which is Gaussian. But in this case, it's a superposition.

Wait, perhaps the given state is a coherent state when phi is 0. So when phi is not zero, it's non-Gaussian.

But given the parameters phi=-pi/4, and alpha=0.5, the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm.

In conclusion, since the state is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. The options are A, B, or C. Without knowing the exact method to compute S(tau), I can't find the exact value. But perhaps the answer is option C)1.38.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a product state. But that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to realize that the state is a cat state, and the non-Gaussianity is non-zero, so the answer is not D.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option C)1.38. Alternatively, perhaps it's option B)0.25.

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's time to make an educated guess. Considering that the given state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, and the options, I'll go with option C) 1.38.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\), \(\phi = -\pi/4\), and \(\alpha = 0.5\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **Non-Gaussianity of the State**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\), which makes it a non-Gaussian state. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is not, as it introduces interference terms that deviate from Gaussian statistics.

2. **Relative Entropy Formula**: The formula \(\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau)\) is provided. For a pure state like \(|\psi\rangle\), the entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\). Thus, \(\text{del}_b = -S(\tau)\), where \(S(\tau)\) is the entropy of the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). Non-Gaussianity is typically a positive measure, so the formula might be interpreted as \(S(\tau) - S(\rho)\), which would yield a positive value.

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) is not explicitly defined in the problem. A common approach is to take \(\tau\) as the closest Gaussian state to \(\rho\), which would match the first and second moments of \(\rho\). For a single-mode Gaussian state, the entropy depends on parameters like squeezing and displacement.

4. **Moments of \(\rho\)**:
   - The expectation value \(\langle a \rangle\) was computed as approximately \(-1.5407\).
   - The second moment \(\langle a^2 \rangle\) was found to be approximately \(0.25\).
   - The variance \(\text{Var}(a) = \langle a^2 \rangle - \langle a \rangle^2\) was initially calculated as negative, which is unphysical. This suggests a possible error in the computation, but the exact resolution was not determined.

5. **Non-Gaussianity Interpretation**: Since the state is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero. Among the options, \(D = 0\) is unlikely because the state is explicitly non-Gaussian. The remaining options (\(A = 2.48\), \(B = 0.25\), \(C = 1.38\)) represent plausible non-zero values.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the lack of explicit details about the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\), the most reasonable choice is to select the option that aligns with the expected non-zero non-Gaussianity of the Schrödinger cat state. Based on the reasoning and the provided options, the most likely answer is:
