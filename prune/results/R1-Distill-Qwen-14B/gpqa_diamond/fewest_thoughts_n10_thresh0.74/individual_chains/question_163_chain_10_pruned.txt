Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, I'm a bit stuck, but I'll walk through my thoughts step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ (which is 0.1 liters) of solution. We need to find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

First, I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with and what happens when it's dissolved in acid.

Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. I remember that hydroxides can react with acids in neutralization reactions. The general reaction would be the hydroxide reacting with a strong acid to produce water and the corresponding salt. Since it's a monobasic acid, I think each molecule of the acid will donate one H+ ion.

So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe³+ + H2O. Wait, more accurately, the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, wait, no. Because Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, so it can donate three OH- ions. When it reacts with H+, each OH- will take an H+ to form water. So each Fe(OH)3 needs three H+ ions to fully dissolve. So the balanced equation is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O.

So, for every mole of Fe(OH)3, we need three moles of H+ ions.

Next, let's calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... Iron (Fe) is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, Hydrogen (H) is 1.008 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 has 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1.008)) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Let's say approximately 9.358e-4 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028075 mol.

Now, the strong acid provided is 0.1 M (molarity), which is 0.1 mol per liter. We need to find the volume (in cm³) of this acid that provides at least 0.0028075 mol of H+.

Molarity is moles per liter, so volume (in liters) = moles / Molarity. So:

Volume = 0.0028075 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028075 L = 28.075 cm³.

Hmm, that's about 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and option B is 30.09. So 28.08 is closest to option C. But wait, is that the minimum volume?
