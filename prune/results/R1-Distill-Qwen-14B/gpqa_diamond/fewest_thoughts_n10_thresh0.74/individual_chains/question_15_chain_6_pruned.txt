Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting, and they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. The host stars are different: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved.

The options are about which planet has a higher transit probability and by how much.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Oh wait, the transit probability is higher if the star is smaller and the planet's orbital distance is just right. The formula I recall is P = (R_star / a_orbital) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e^2)), but since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term is 1, so maybe I can ignore that part for this problem. So P is proportional to R_star / a_orbital.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the probability also depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. But the question doesn't mention the planet sizes, just that they're Earth-like. Since both are Earth-like, their sizes are probably similar, so maybe the planet size isn't a factor here. The question is about the star's radius and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, but the orbital period is given. So I can use Kepler's third law to find the semi-major axis (a_orbital) for each planet.

Kepler's third law states that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_star) / (4π²). So a = [ (G M_star P²) / (4π²) ]^(1/3). But since P is given, and M_star is known, I can find a for each planet.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way. Since both planets are detected via RV method, their minimum masses are known. I think RV gives the mass in terms of the planet's mass and the sine
