Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let's see. The problem says that the operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as some matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the vector n is in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

First, I remember that for angular momentum in quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues correspond to ħ times the quantum number. Since the eigenvalue here is +ħ/2, that suggests we're dealing with a spin-1/2 system, like an electron or muon. So the operator in question is probably the spin operator, S, but they're calling it P here.

Wait, the operator is P, but the components are given. Let me write down each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

These look familiar. Oh right, these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P is the spin operator for spin-1/2 particles.

The eigenvector we need is for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. The operator P along direction n would be the vector component of P in that direction, which is P·n_hat. 

So the operator we're interested in is P·n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because the direction is in x-z, the y-component (ny) is zero.

Since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. Let me just call the angle θ the angle from the z-axis. So nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ. Or wait, no, in spherical coordinates, usually θ is the angle from the z-axis. So if that's the case, then the components would be nx = sinθ cosφ, but since the direction is in x-z plane, φ is zero. So then, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ, with θ between 0 and
