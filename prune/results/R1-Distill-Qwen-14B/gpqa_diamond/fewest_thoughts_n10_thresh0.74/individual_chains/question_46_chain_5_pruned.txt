Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count again. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. Oh wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me get the structure right.

Pentene is five carbons. For pent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl group on C3. So the correct structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's six carbons. Oh no, wait, no. Let me recount.

Wait, no, pentane is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, that's not possible. Let me think. The formula
