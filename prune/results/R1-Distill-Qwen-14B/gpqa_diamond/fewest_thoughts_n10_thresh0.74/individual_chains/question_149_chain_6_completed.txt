Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The scenario is about analyzing a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like the expected molecule, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, the question is why there are two peaks for the same proton.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So, the same mass but different... maybe something else?

Hmm. What could cause two NMR peaks for the same proton? Well, if the molecule is exchanging between different environments, like maybe some kind of exchange broadening, but that usually leads to a singlet or broader peak, not two separate peaks.

Wait, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So it's not like a splitting from neighboring protons. Then what's left?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with precursor. If that were the case, the NMR would have signals for the precursor as well. But the NMR of the crude shows the expected molecule, except for these two alpha peaks. So maybe the precursor's signals are not appearing? Or maybe the question says it's the same alpha-proton, so probably not a different molecule. So I'm not so sure about A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same NMR spectra because the environments are symmetrical. So if it's a racemic mixture, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton because each enantiomer's protons would mirror each other. So the NMR would look the same as a single enantiomer. So the peaks wouldn't split. So B might not explain the two peaks.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, maybe the alpha protons are equivalent. But if the molecule is not symmetric, having enantiomers might cause each proton to be in a different environment. But wait, no, because in enantiomers, the environments are mirror images. So each proton's chemical shift would be the same. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond forming. Hmm, double coupling in organic chemistry... Maybe it's about the formation of a new bond leading to some coupling. Or perhaps during the reaction, some byproducts form which cause the same alpha protons to split. I'm not exactly sure. Wait, the question says it's an amide bond forming reaction. Maybe the reaction forms some kind of intermediate that leads to two different coupling partners, causing the same proton to split into two. But the coupling pattern is ruled out, so maybe it's not that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to some diastereomers forming, which would affect the NMR.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. If there are two diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton but in different environments, you'd see two separate peaks for that proton. But wait, why would the integrals add to 1H? Because each diastereomer would have the same number of alpha protons. So if each diastereomer has one alpha proton, but you have a 50:50 mixture, you'd have two peaks each integrating to 0.5H, adding up to 1H. That makes sense.

So in the NMR, each diastereomer contributes a peak. So the two peaks would have similar chemical shifts because the diastereomers are similar, and the integrals would add up. And since diastereomers have different coupling patterns, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. Wait, but the coupling in the NMR would depend on the neighboring protons. If the coupling is within each molecule, the diastereomers would have their own coupling, but since the peaks are for the same proton in each structure, maybe the coupling is different in each, leading to different multiplicities. But the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals. So if it's diastereomers, the shifts would be similar but not identical. And the integrals together make 1H, which would mean a 50:50 mix. So that fits.

What about the LC-MS? The LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. Same mass, so same molecular weight. So they must be the same compound but different isomers. So if it's diastereomers, they would have the same molecular weight but different retention times because they are different compounds. But would the mass spectrum be the same? Diastereomers have different structures, but the mass would be same, right? But the mass spectrum depends on fragmentation, which might be different. Wait, the question says the mass spectrum is the same. Oh, but wait, if the diastereomers have the same molecular formula, their mass is same, but their fragmentation patterns could be different. But in the question, the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule. So perhaps the two are diastereomers, but when you run LC-MS, each peak is a separate diastereomer, but they have the same molecular weight.

So the options are between B and D. Wait, if it's diastereomers, the NMR would show different peaks for each. If it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would look normal because the enantiomers are mirror images. So the NMR wouldn't see the two peaks. So in the question, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, which suggests that the molecule is not a single enantiomer but perhaps a mix of diastereomers. So D seems more plausible.

Another thought: if the compound formed during synthesis has some kind of tautomerism or some other reversible process, but that might show as a singlet with some exchange broadening. Plus, the question mentions that the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule except for these two peaks. So it's not an exchange issue.

So putting it together, the most likely answer is D: the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because each diastereomer has that proton in a slightly different environment. The LC-MS shows two peaks because each diastereomer is a separate compound, same molecular weight, same mass spectrum (but wait, would the mass spectrum be identical? Diastereomers have the same molecular weight, so same mass. But their fragmentation would be different, so the mass spec would look different. Hmm, but the question says the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule. So the expected molecule would have a certain mass, which both peaks match. So that's okay. So the two peaks in LC-MS are diastereomers, same molecular weight.)

So the correct answer should be D.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and a coupling pattern that rules out spin-spin coupling. LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Analysis of the Options:

**Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, the NMR would likely show additional peaks corresponding to the precursor's protons, not just two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Since the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule except for the two alpha-proton peaks, this explanation is unlikely.

**Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
Enantiomers are mirror images of each other, and their NMR spectra are identical because the chemical environments of the protons are the same. A racemic mixture would not produce two separate peaks for the same alpha-proton. Therefore, this explanation does not account for the observed NMR data.

**Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the two peaks. Additionally, "double coupling" during an amide-bond forming reaction is not a common or well-defined phenomenon that would explain the observed NMR and LC-MS data. This option is unlikely.

**Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can produce distinct NMR signals for the same proton because the chemical environments are different. A 50:50 mixture of two diastereoisomers would result in two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (adding up to 1H). The LC-MS data supports this explanation, as the two peaks have the same mass (same molecular formula) but different retention times, consistent with diastereoisomers. This explanation aligns with both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

### Conclusion:  
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The NMR data shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton due to the different chemical environments in the diastereomers, and the LC-MS data confirms the presence of two distinct compounds with the same molecular weight.

Answer: D
