Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution when mixing different acids and bases. Hmm, let's see... I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is: We have three solutions mixed together. They are 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions. Acetic acid is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So their reaction will involve H+ and OH- ions.

Wait, let me think: Mixing an acid and a base will result in a neutralization reaction, producing water and a salt. But here, we have three solutions being mixed. So I should probably calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions from each of the solutions and see which is in excess.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from CH3COOH.
2. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl.
3. Calculate moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.
4. Then, find out if there's an excess of H+ or OH- after neutralization.
5. Determine the concentration of the excess H+ or OH-.
6. Finally, calculate pH using the excess concentration.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid. Does that matter here? Because when you mix it with a strong base, the neutralization would proceed. But wait, maybe the H+ from HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it also fully dissociates.

So let me compute each part.

First, find the volume and molarity for each solution. Let me note the volumes in liters because moles = Molarity × Volume (in L).

For CH3COOH: 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but wait, in this problem, we're mixing it with HCl and Ba(OH)2. So maybe I should treat the H+ from CH3COOH as it contributes, but since it's a weak acid, the contribution is minimal compared to the strong acid HCl.

Wait, but when you mix HCl (a strong acid) with CH3COOH (weak acid), the H+ from HCl will suppress the dissociation of acetic acid, making it even weaker. But in this case, maybe the H+ from HCl is so strong that the acetic acid's contribution is negligible. So perhaps I can ignore the acetic acid's H+ when considering neutralization with the strong base. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the overall solution after mixing all three. So let me compute the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, but wait: When you mix an acid and a base, the H+ from the acid reacts with OH- from the base. So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So I should calculate the total moles of H+ from all acids (CH3COOH and HCl) and the total moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. Then, subtract to find which is in excess.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully donate H+. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates, giving H+ equal to its moles. Ba(OH)2 is
