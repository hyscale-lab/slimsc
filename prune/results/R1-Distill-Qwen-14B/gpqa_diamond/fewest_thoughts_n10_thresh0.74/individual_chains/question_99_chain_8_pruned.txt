Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to be some kind of substituted carboxylic acids. Let's look at the data provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that a broad peak around there usually indicates the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since all the options end with COOH, they're all carboxylic acids, so that makes sense. The other strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 is likely from the carbonyl group (C=O) of the carboxylic acid. So that's consistent with all options as well.

Now, moving on to the NMR. The question says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the structure doesn't have any double bonds, which makes sense because all the options I'm looking at don't seem to have any double bonds. They're all single bonds, with branching maybe.

The tricky part is the splitting in the NMR signals. One signal is a doublet of triplet of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplet of triplets. Hmm. I need to figure out what kind of splitting that would result from.

So, I should probably draw each structure and analyze the possible hydrogen environments.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
This structure is something like a central carbon attached to two ethyl groups and another CH2 group leading to COOH. Let me visualize it. Wait, maybe it's better written as:

The structure would be: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH.

So the central two carbons each have two substituents: one ethyl and one CH2COOH group, perhaps? Or maybe each has an ethyl and a CH3? Wait, wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the formula for option A is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So each of the middle two carbons is connected to an ethyl group (C2H5), a hydrogen, and another carbon. So each of those carbons is probably CH2, but with substituents. Wait, no, because each has a H and two ethyl groups? No, wait: each is connected to a CH3, a C2H5, and a CH2 group. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me count the substituents.

Wait, the formula is written as CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH
