Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about measuring observables P and Q of a system, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes. 

Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). I think that's a column vector, so in matrix terms, it's a 3x1 matrix. Let me write that down.

The operator for P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row has 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2). Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. And the operator for Q is another 3x3 matrix. First row is (1,0,0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-1). 

The question is about measuring Q just after P. Wait no, wait, the measurements are done in sequence: first P, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the question says "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So first P is measured, getting 0, then Q is measured, getting -1.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. Then measuring Q would be on that new state.

So the steps would be: find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q. Then, compute the probability of measuring 0 for P, then given that the state is in that eigenstate, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q.

But wait, what are the possible eigenvalues of P and Q? Let me think.

First, let's consider operator P. Its matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0
