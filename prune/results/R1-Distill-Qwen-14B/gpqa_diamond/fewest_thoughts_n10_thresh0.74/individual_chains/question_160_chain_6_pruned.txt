Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining perpendicular onto this aperture. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tanθ as θ. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of bright and dark spots called the diffraction pattern. The far field region, or Fraunhofer diffraction, is where the pattern is focused and can be analyzed using certain formulas.

Wait, for circular apertures, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22λ/(diameter). But in this case, the aperture is a regular N-gon, and N is approaching infinity, making it effectively a circular aperture? Or is it a different shape? Wait, no. Because as N increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle, but the way the apothems are arranged might be different.

Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, all apothems are the same length. So the apothem 'a' is the same for every side. So, when N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle with radius a. But wait, the radius of the polygon is the distance from the center to a vertex, right? Or is the apothem the same as the radius for a polygon? No, I think for regular polygons, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, while the radius is the distance to the vertex (the circumscribed circle). So when N is large, the polygon's shape is very close to a circle, but maybe the formula differs because the apothem is given.

Wait, but how does this relate to the diffraction pattern? For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(2a'), where a' is the radius. But in this case, the apothem is 'a'—which would be the radius of the inscribed circle. So if the polygon becomes a circle, then the radius would be a / cos(π/N), because for a regular polygon, the apothem a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius. So as N approaches infinity, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1. So R approaches a. Thus, the radius of the circle would be a. So for the circular case, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ/(2a), because the diameter is 2a? Or wait, no. Wait, the diameter is 2R. So if R is a, diameter is 2a. Then the formula is θ = 1.22 λ/(2a). So 1.22 λ/(2a) would be the angle for the first minimum. Hmm.

But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So in the case of a circular aperture, there's only one minimum at that angle, right? Because the pattern is
