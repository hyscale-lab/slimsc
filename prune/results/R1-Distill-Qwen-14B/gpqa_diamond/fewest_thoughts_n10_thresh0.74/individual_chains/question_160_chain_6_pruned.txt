Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction patterns, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems (I remember apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and it's creating intensity maxima and minima in the far field. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh right, and we can use the approximation tanθ ≈ θ because the angles are small.

Hmm, so when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon becomes indistinguishable from a circle. So maybe this is a circular aperture problem? But wait, the original aperture is a polygon, but when N is very large, it's like a circle. So I think the diffraction pattern would resemble that of a circular aperture, but maybe with some differences because the original is a polygon.

Wait, but the options don't look like the standard single-slit or circular diffraction minima. Oh wait, no, the problem is about the first two minima. Wait, in single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at certain angles, and for a circular aperture, the minima are given by the Bessel functions zeros.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. For a single slit, the first minima are at θ = λ/(a), where 'a' is the slit width. But that's for a single slit. For a circular aperture, the minima occur at θ where the Bessel function J1 is zero, specifically at the first zero of J1, which is about 1.22λ/a. That's the formula I remember, like the first minimum in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture is at θ ≈ 1.22λ/(diameter), but wait, the apothem here is 'a'—what's the relation between apothem and diameter when N is large?

Wait, wait. The apothem 'a' of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular N-gon with very large N, the polygon approximates a circle of radius R.
