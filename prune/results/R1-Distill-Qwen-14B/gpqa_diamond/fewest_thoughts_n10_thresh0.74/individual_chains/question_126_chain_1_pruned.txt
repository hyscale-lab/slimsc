Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again.

An organic chemist performs two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

Alright, let's break down each reaction.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. I remember that ketones are typically reduced by LAH to secondary alcohols. Since the starting material is a ketone at position 3, the product should be a secondary alcohol. But wait, the molecule also has a methoxy group at position 5. When LAH reduces, does it affect the methoxy group? Hmm, LAH usually doesn't reduce ethers, so the methoxy should stay as is. So the product from Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO. So if the starting structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is: CH2CH2C(O)CH2-OCH3? No, wait, the numbering. Let me think. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CO something. Wait, hexan-3-one is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But in this case, it's 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the position 3 is the ketone (CO), and at position 5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2-OCH3-CH2CH3? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3
