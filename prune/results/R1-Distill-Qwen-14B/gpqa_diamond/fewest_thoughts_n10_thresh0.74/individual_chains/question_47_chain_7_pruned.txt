Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me start by jotting down the data and looking for clues.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmNO2, so for n=9, m=11. The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x)/2, where x is the number of halogens. Here, x=0, so (2*9 +2 -11 -0)/2 = (20-11)/2= 9/2=4.5? Wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. For this case, C=9, H=11, X=0, N=1. So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (3 double bonds) plus a double bond or ring elsewhere, and maybe an amide or ester group.

Looking at the IR data. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. Could be an amide, ester, ketone, or maybe a nitrile. But given the N in the formula, probably amide or ester.

In the NMR data, let's go through each peak:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) - This is a triplet, likely a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like an ethyl group (OCH2CH3). The triplet suggests two neighboring groups, so maybe -OCH2CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) - Broad singlet, 2H. Could be an NH2 group, but in a different environment. Or maybe a OCH2 group. Alternatively, it could be an N-attached CH2, but the broadness might suggest something like an amide NH, but that's usually a broad peak in the 1-5 ppm range, but this is a singlet for 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a coupling; perhaps an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen, but wait, the 1.20 ppm is the methyl, so this 4.0 is the OCH2.

Wait, but if it's OCH2CH3, the OCH2 would be a quartet in the 4.0-4.3 ppm region. Wait, but the 4.0 is a singlet. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 attached to something else, like a nitrogen.

Another peak at 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) - Quadruplet. 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3, but wait, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield for a CH2 next to an O. Alternatively, it's a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen and another CH2. Wait, perhaps it's an ethoxy group attached to another CH2. Let me think.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene. Like two substituents on opposite positions. So, for example, a para-substituted benzene where each substituent has a certain effect on the neighboring
