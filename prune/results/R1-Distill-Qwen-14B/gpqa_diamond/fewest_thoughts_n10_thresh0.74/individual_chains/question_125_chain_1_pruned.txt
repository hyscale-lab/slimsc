Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². I remember that for a harmonic oscillator, whether one-dimensional or three-dimensional, the energy levels are quantized. 

Wait, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I think is the form for a 3D isotropic oscillator. So each direction (x, y, z) contributes equally, right? But sometimes, in spherical coordinates, it's treated as r squared. So maybe it's the same thing because r² = x² + y² + z². So the system is separable into three 1D oscillators.

I remember that the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2)ℏω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In 3D, each direction has a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z. The total n is n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy is E = (n + 3/2)ℏω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2)ℏω, so adding them up gives (n_x + n_y +n_z + 3/2)ℏω. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So the problem is asking about the third excited state. Hmm, wait. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is when n=0 (n_x=n_y=n_z=0). The first excited state would be n=1, then n=2, and so on. So the third excited state would be n=3? Wait, no. Wait, no, because the ground state is the zeroth excited state. So the first excited state is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state is when n=3.

Wait, no. Let me double-check. Because the ground state is the state with the lowest energy, which is the first state. So the excited states are the higher ones. So the ground state is n
