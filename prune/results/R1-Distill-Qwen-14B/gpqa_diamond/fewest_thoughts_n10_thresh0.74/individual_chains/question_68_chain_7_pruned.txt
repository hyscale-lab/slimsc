Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let me read the question again.

So the question is about a spin 1/2 particle. It starts with its magnetic moment aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. Now, we're supposed to find the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Hmm. I remember that spin-½ particles have magnetic moments related to their spin. The magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, where Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So mu = gamma S_z.

When the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle's spin will align with it. The energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect here. The energy is E = -mu·B. Since mu is aligned with B, the energy is minimized when the spin is up, and higher when down.

But wait, when the field is suddenly switched off and then another field along Y is applied. So initially, the system was in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with B in Z. When the field changes to Y, the Hamiltonian changes too.

Wait, the initial state: when the magnetic field is along Z, the spin is aligned with it, so the state is along +Z, which is an eigenstate of S_z. The magnetic moment is along Z, so mu_z is gamma times ħ/2 (since S_z for spin ½ is ħ/2 when spin-up).

But when the field is suddenly applied along Y, the Hamiltonian changes. The old Hamiltonian was H_initial = -gamma B S_z. After the switch, H_final = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, or do I have that right? Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, right? So the energy is E = -mu · B. If the field is along Y, then E = -gamma B S_y.

So the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -gamma B S_y.

Now, the initial state was |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z. But the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y, so the eigenstates of H will be |+y> and |-y>, which are eigenstates of S_y.

So the system starts in |+
