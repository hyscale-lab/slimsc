Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, but I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that in stars, the presence of spots can affect their overall brightness and temperature, which in turn affects the ionization states of elements in the photosphere.

Let me break down the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait a second—that's a big drop, especially considering that spots are cooler regions. Oh, right, when spots cover part of the surface, the observed effective temperature is lower because those spots are emitting less light.

The main point is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when no spots are present divided by the ratio when spots are present.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. I'm trying to recall the relevant physics here. Oh, right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. But wait, wait—the problem states that when the star has spots, the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So, when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, which affects the ratio.

But wait, the spots themselves are cooler, so perhaps the photosphere's temperature structure is a bit different. But the problem says the overall Te
