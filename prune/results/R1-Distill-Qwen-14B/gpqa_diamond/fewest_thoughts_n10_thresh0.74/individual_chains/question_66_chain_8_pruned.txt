Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are A, B, C, D, each combining different numbers.

Wait, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory, meaning it incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. Effective theories usually respect the same symmetries as the underlying theory, which in this case is the SM. The SM respects certain symmetries, so SMEFT must too.

First, let's break down each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry in the SM. It includes rotations and boosts. All SM interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must also respect it. Otherwise, the theory wouldn't be Lorentz invariant, which is a big no-no for relativistic theories.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincare implies momentum conservation, etc. But wait, isn't Lorentz symmetry a subset of Poincare? Because Lorentz transformations plus translations make up the Poincare group. So if the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But in SMEFT, do all operators respect Poincare? I think so, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe they're considered separately because SMEFT is an effective theory.

Wait, the SM has global symmetries as well as gauge symmetries. But when considering the SMEFT, the operators are classified into dimension-6 operators, and each operator must be invariant under the SM gauge group and Lorentz symmetry. Wait, but what about Poincare? Because in the SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields, and under Lorentz symmetry, these fields transform in specific ways. But Poincare includes translations as well. I'm a bit confused here. Oh right, the SM respects Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT, being an effective theory built from the SM, should also respect Poincare.

But wait, the question is whether all operators in SMEFT must respect each of
