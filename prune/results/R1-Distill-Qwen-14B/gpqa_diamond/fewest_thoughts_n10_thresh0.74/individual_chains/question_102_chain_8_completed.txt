Okay, let's tackle this science question. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and a mouse model. 

So, they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. The ligand uses the CBA promoter. Oh wait, CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's constitutive. The receptor is under an IRES element, which allows internal ribosome entry, meaning it can be expressed without the need for a separate promoter, but I'm not entirely sure how that works in bicistronic vectors.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So, that's a way to prevent expression of the downstream gene unless Cre is present to excise the stop. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop with lox2272. Oh wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, right? So, if Cre is present, it can recombine these sites. 

They raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression on Western blot. So, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes and saw signals proportional to actin loading, which makes sense because you need to normalize for protein amount.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, right? So, SOX10-Cre would drive Cre expression in neural crest cells, perhaps. 

After the offspring are born, they visualize under confocal. But they don't see a green signal, which is eGFP. Green would indicate the receptor-eGFP is expressed.

So, what's going wrong here? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But why would that affect expression in the mouse model? They're checking for GFP expression, which is about the receptor expression, not function. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So, if it's not trafficking properly, you wouldn't see GFP on the surface. But how would that affect the Western blot? If the protein is made but not secreted, it might still be present in the cell, so the Western would show it. Unless the construct is faulty. But the question says the Western blot was okay. So maybe this isn't the main issue.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. Wait, the CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so maybe it's constitutively expressed. But if the enhancer is missing, perhaps the expression isn't happening in the right cells or at the right time. But in the mouse model, if the SOX10-Cre is supposed to induce expression, maybe the construct isn't activated. Wait, but the vector's structure uses the CBA promoter for ligand and IRES for receptor. So CBA is probably driving ligand expression, and IRES allows receptor expression. But if in the mouse, the Cre is necessary to remove the stop cassettes. So maybe the stops aren't being excised, so the proteins aren't expressed. Oh wait, in the vector, the ligand is at 5' with a stop in loxP cassette. So, to express the ligand, Cre would excise the stop, allowing ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, and the stop between receptor and eGFP is in a lox2272 cassette. So when Cre is present, it should excise both stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But if the mice are homozygous for the construct, and then crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a Cre source, then the stops should be excised. So, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But in the mouse, if there's no green signal, maybe the receptor isn't being expressed. So why? The Western blot was done in transfected astrocytes and saw the signals. So the construct works in vitro. So the problem is in the mouse.

Wait, maybe the IRES isn't working properly. The IRES is for the receptor, but if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor won't be expressed. Or perhaps the promoters are not correctly set up. Wait, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES, which is part of the same transcript. So the ligand is first, then the IRES, then the receptor, then the stop cassette, then eGFP.

Wait, no. The vector is ligand (CBA promoter), then stop in loxP, then mCherry? Or is the ligand ORF followed by a stop with loxP, then the IRES, then the receptor, then stop with lox2272, then eGFP. Wait, the question says the ligand ORF is at the 5', fused to mCherry, with a stop in a loxP cassette. So, the ligand is followed by a stop, then mCherry. But wait, no, because if the stop is between the ligand and mCherry, that suggests that when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing both ligand and mCherry to be expressed as a single transcript. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the vector is set up is that the ligand is under CBA, and after the ligand ORF, there's a stop in a loxP cassette, which would prevent the downstream mCherry from being expressed unless Cre excises the stop, allowing the mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor is at 3', with a stop in lox2272 before eGFP. So, when Cre is present, both stops are excised, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the mouse, the construct is homozygous. So, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, which expresses Cre in neural crest cells (and perhaps other places), the stops should be excised, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed. So, mCherry and eGFP should be expressed in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes.

But in the confocal, no green signal, meaning no eGFP. So why?

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, if the stop cassette isn't correctly spliced, or if the frames are off, the eGFP might not be expressed. Wait, but in the vector, the receptor is at the 3' end, and the stop is between receptor and eGFP. So, Cre would excise the stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop codon is in the way. So, if the stop isn't excised, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But if the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP would be in frame? Wait, no. The stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So, when Cre recombines, it deletes the stop, allowing the receptor to be translated into its ORF and then the eGFP to be translated as a separate ORF with IRES maybe?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. The vector is a bicistronic construct, meaning two cistrons (two ORFs). The first cistron is ligand under CBA, then a stop in loxP, then mCherry. The second cistron is receptor, then a stop in lox2272, then eGFP. Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the ligand is at 5' and fused to mCherry, which suggests that the ligand and mCherry are part of the same ORF? Or no, wait, the ligand ORF is 5', and mCherry is after a stop. Hmm, perhaps the vector is designed so that when Cre is present, it deletes the loxP stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed as separate proteins, and similarly the receptor and eGFP.

But perhaps the issue is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't being excised. But why wouldn't it?

Wait, the mice are homozygous for the construct. So, each allele has the vector. When they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic mouse that expresses Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So, in the offspring, the Cre should excise the loxP and lox2272 stops, enabling expression of the ligand, mCherry, receptor, and eGFP.

But what if the IRES isn't working? The IRES is between the ligand and the receptor? Or is the IRES after the receptor? Let me think again. The setup is: ligand ORF at 5' with mCherry, with a stop between them in a loxP cassette. Then upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So, perhaps the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF. So, the first gene is ligand under CBA, then the IRES, then the receptor, then a stop in lox2272, then eGFP. Wait, no, because the ligand is at 5' and the receptor at 3'. So maybe the structure is:

5' - CBA promoter - ligand ORF - stop (loxP) - mCherry - IRES - receptor ORF - stop (lox2272) - eGFP - 3'

Wait, no, that might not make sense because the IRES is usually in between two ORFs to allow for their expression. Alternatively, the vector could have the ligand under CBA, followed by a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Then, after that, the IRES, then the receptor, followed by a stop with lox2272 and eGFP.

But if that's the case, in the presence of Cre, the loxP would be excised, allowing ligand and mCherry to be co-expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 would be excised, allowing receptor and eGFP to be co-expressed. But wait, the IRES is for the receptor. So the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed after the ligand, perhaps.

Wait, no, in a bicistronic vector, the IRES usually allows the second gene to be expressed from the same transcript. So, the first gene (ligand) is under the CBA promoter, then the IRES, and then the receptor. But in this case, the ligand is fused to mCherry, which implies perhaps a tag, but I'm not sure how that's structured.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is: [CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> stop (loxP) --> mCherry; and then [IRES] --> receptor ORF --> stop (lox2272) --> eGFP.

Wait, but that would be two separate cassettes, each with their own stop. So, the first cassette is ligand and mCherry, with a loxP stop. The second is receptor and eGFP with a lox2272 stop. So the vector is bicistronic in the sense that it has two separate ORFs, each with their own expression cassettes.

But how does the IRES factor in? Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor. So the structure is:

5' -- CBA promoter driving ligand ORF -- stop (loxP) -- mCherry -- IRES -- receptor ORF -- stop (lox2272) -- eGFP -- 3'

Hmm, that might not make sense. Alternatively, the IRES is used for the receptor, allowing its expression without a promoter. So, the ligand is under CBA, then after the ligand ORF, there's a stop in a loxP cassette, then mCherry. Then, the IRES, then the receptor, then a stop in lox2272, then eGFP.

If that's the case, then in the presence of Cre, the loxP and lox2272 stops are excised, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But why would the eGFP not show up in the mouse?

Wait, the problem is that in the mouse, when they visualize the offspring under confocal, they don't see green. So, eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Looking at the options, option D says that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, if the stop is not excised, then the receptor would be truncated, and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the stops should be excised.

Wait, but perhaps the loxP and lox2272 sites are in a configuration that Cre can't recombine them. Or maybe the strain is hemizygous for Cre, so only one allele is being cut. Oh wait, the construct is homozygous, so each allele has the vector. The mice are crossed to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10-Cre is on one allele. So, in the offspring, each cell has two copies of the construct (homozygous) and one copy of SOX10-Cre (hemizygous). So, when Cre is expressed, it should recombine both alleles' lox sites.

Wait, but the lox sites are loxP and lox2272. Oh, wait, lox2272 is a variant of loxP. Cre can recombine loxP with lox2272, but it's directional. So, if the vector has a loxP upstream and lox2272 downstream, Cre would cut both, but perhaps the way the vector is designed, the recombination doesn't excise the stop properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functional, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But the IRES is supposed to allow the receptor's expression regardless of the promoter. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the presence of the stop cassettes might mean that the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop is not excised. But why wouldn't Cre do that?

Wait, in the mouse, if the construct is homozygous, and the Cre is active in neural crest cells, then both alleles would have their stops excised. So, the eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, but in the question, the offspring are visualized under confocal. So, perhaps the expression is not in the right cell type. Oh, wait, the mouse is homozygous, meaning the construct is present in all cells. But the Cre is under SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So, only in neural crest-derived cells would the stops be excised, allowing expression of the ligand and receptor. But if the Cre isn't active in the cells where the eGFP is supposed to be expressed, then the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the construct is in all cells, but only in neural crest cells would Cre be active. So, perhaps the eGFP is only expressed in neural crest cells, but the visualization is done in a different cell type. But the question says they use confocal to visualize, probably looking at cells where the receptor should be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor. If the stop cassette isn't excised correctly, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But in the presence of Cre, the stop should be excised.

Wait, another possibility: the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But the IRES is supposed to drive expression of the receptor. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed, but why would the Western blot in astrocytes show the proteins? Unless the construct is expressed without the IRES. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, let's go back to the options. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So, if the stop is still present, then the eGFP isn't being expressed. But when Cre is present, the stop should be excised. Alternatively, maybe the lox sites are arranged in such a way that the stop isn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another angle: if the lox2272 is a different site, and the Cre used doesn't recognize it, but I thought Cre can recombine lox2272. Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses loxP and lox2272 in a way that doesn't allow recombination, so the stops aren't excised.

Alternatively, maybe the vector is set up such that the IRES is not compatible with the eGFP expression. For example, if the IRES is between the receptor and eGFP, but in the wrong frame, then eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is in the wrong orientation. Or perhaps the eGFP is not in frame after the stop is removed. So, when the stop is excised, the reading frame shifts, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP expression.

Wait, but if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then excising it would allow the receptor and eGFP to be in frame. If they're not in frame, then the eGFP might not be expressed correctly, leading to no signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop was in the middle of the eGFP's ORF, so without the stop, the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. Or vice versa.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop and then eGFP. So, the stop is after the receptor. So, when Cre excises the stop, the eGFP should be expressed as a separate ORF. So, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame after the stop is removed, leading to a frameshift. But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the vector wasn't correctly designed, and the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the receptor is translated until the stop, and eGFP isn't expressed. But that's not how it's supposed to work.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is such that the eGFP is not correctly expressed. So, the stop is in the way, and without it, the eGFP isn't in frame. But that would require that the stop's removal leads to a frameshift.

Wait, but the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. So, the lox sites flank the stop. When Cre recombines, it deletes the stop, allowing the eGFP to be expressed. If the stop is in the correct place, then eGFP should be expressed in frame.

But if the vector's design has the stop in a position that, when excised, the eGFP is not in frame, then you wouldn't get eGFP expression.

So, option D suggests that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That could be the issue. So, when the stop is excised, the receptor and eGFP are in the same reading frame? Or not.

Wait, the receptor and eGFP are separate ORFs. The vector design allows for the receptor to be expressed as one ORF, and eGFP as another. So, the stop is between them. So, excising the stop would allow the eGFP to be expressed. But if the stop is in a way that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed, or produces a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they looked for overexpressed proteins. If the eGFP is part of the receptor ORF, perhaps the blot would detect it. But the question says the Western was successful, so the construct works in vitro. So, the problem must be in the in vivo setup.

Hmm. Another thought: the stop cassettes might not have been properly recombined because the Cre wasn't active, but the mouse was crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should provide Cre in the right cells.

Wait, but what if the IRES element is not functional, so the receptor isn't expressed. Then, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either because the IRES is needed for the receptor, and eGFP is downstream.

But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong. So, maybe the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't because the IRES isn't working. Then, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, but the Western blot would show the ligand expressed, perhaps.

Wait, but the question says that after transfecting into astrocytes, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin. So, the construct is working in vitro. So, the problem must be in the in vivo setup, not the construct's design.

Another possibility: the eGFP is not being expressed because the IRES wasn't activated in the mouse. But in vitro, the IRES worked because the astrocytes allowed for its expression. Alternatively, maybe the IRES is only functional in certain cell types.

Wait, but the mouse model is for neural crest cells, which are the target. So, perhaps the IRES isn't active in those cells, leading to no receptor or eGFP expression.

But that would mean the enhancer is missing, which is option C. Wait, option C says the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so perhaps the ligand is expressed regardless. But the IRES for the receptor might require a certain enhancer.

Wait, no, IRES doesn't require enhancers because it's a ribosome entry site. So, it should drive expression regardless of the promoter. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector didn't get properly integrated into the mouse genome, so the construct isn't expressed. But the question states that the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so it's present.

Wait, another angle: the expression is in the wrong orientation. Suppose the eGFP is in the opposite direction, so when Cre excises, it's not expressed. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, going back to the options, which one is the most plausible?

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the vector had the receptor followed by a stop and then eGFP, when the stop is excised, the eGFP should be expressed as a separate ORF after the receptor. But if they're in the same frame, then perhaps the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor, leading to a fusion protein. But that's not the case because the stop was between them.

Wait, perhaps the vector was designed such that the eGFP is in the same reading frame as the receptor, so when the stop is removed, the receptor and eGFP are translated as a single ORF, which may not produce functional eGFP. But in reality, they should be separate ORFs.

Alternatively, perhaps the 3' end of the receptor is followed by the eGFP, and without the stop, the eGFP is in the same frame, causing a frame shift. But in reality, the eGFP would be in frame.

I'm not entirely sure, but considering all the options, perhaps option D is the most likely. Alternatively, maybe the enhancer is missing, but the CBA promoter should drive expression regardless.

Wait, another possibility: in the vector, the eGFP is after the receptor, which is after the IRES. So, when the stop is excised, the eGFP is expressed. But if the IRES doesn't function in the mouse, the receptor isn't expressed, and neither is eGFP.

But IRES should function in most cell types. So, that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the IRES is between the ligand and the receptor, so the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't. But no, the ligand and mCherry are in the first cassette, and the receptor and eGFP in the second.

I think I'm going in circles. Looking again at the options, the most plausible is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the vector's design caused them to be in the same frame, then eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly, leading to no signal.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair, with mCherry fused to the ligand and eGFP fused to the receptor. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites are present between the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP, respectively. The construct is homozygous in the mouse model, and SOX10-Cre mice are used to excise the stops. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy in the offspring.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the question focuses on the expression of eGFP, which is a marker for receptor expression, not the functional relationship between the ligand and receptor. This does not explain the lack of eGFP signal.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it might not reach the cell surface, but it would still be detectable via Western blot. Since the Western blot confirmed expression in vitro, this is unlikely to be the issue.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter and does not require additional enhancers. The IRES element for the receptor should allow its expression without requiring an enhancer. Thus, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   The vector design includes a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP. When Cre excises the stop, the receptor and eGFP should be expressed as separate ORFs. If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly, leading to no green signal. This is the most plausible explanation, as improper framing could prevent proper eGFP expression.

### Conclusion:
The lack of a green signal is most likely due to the receptor and eGFP being out of frame, preventing proper eGFP expression.
