Okay, let's tackle this physics problem. Hmm, it's about two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle. I remember that when particles are emitted, certain quantum numbers must be conserved, like angular momentum and parity. Oh right, Pauli statistics also play a role here.

So the initial state is a 1S0 state. Let me break that down. The notation is (2S+1)LJ. For 1S0, 2S+1 is 1, so S must be 0. L is S, which I think refers to orbital angular momentum. So L is 0. And J is 0. So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Wait, the parity of the system must be considered. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L), where L is the orbital angular momentum. Initially, the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

After emitting particle X, the parity changes. The parity of the final state (NN) is the product of the initial parity, the parity of X, and the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Or wait, maybe I should think about how the parity is calculated when a particle is emitted. Hmm. The parity of the system after emission would be the parity of X multiplied by the orbital angular momentum state it's emitted in, multiplied by the initial parity.

Wait, the total parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle and the parity due to the orbital angular momentum. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When a particle is emitted, the total parity of the system is the product of the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle and the parity from the orbital angular momentum state of the emitted particle. So for the initial parity, it's +1. After emission, the parity is (initial parity) * parity of X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of X. Because when you emit a particle, the orbital state contributes a (-1)^l to the parity.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. The total parity is the product of the intrinsic parity of the particles and the orbital angular momentum's contribution. But wait, in the case of two nucleons, the initial state's parity is +1 because L=0. After emission, the two nucleons are in some state with orbital angular momentum L', and the emitted particle has orbital angular momentum l. So the orbital part contributes (-1)^(L' + l). Or wait, perhaps the parity of the emitted particle X is considered as part of the state. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should focus on the conservation of parity. The initial parity is +1. The parity after emission should also be +1 because parity is conserved in strong interactions, but wait, the problem doesn't specify if it's electromagnetic or strong. Oh, but the question says 'make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity.' So parity is conserved here.

The process is NN initial state (parity +1) emits X (parity -1), so the parity of the final state (NN plus X) must be +1 * (-1) * (-
