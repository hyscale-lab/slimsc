Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light relative to the observer. Oh, and they mention c=1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Wait, so when light passes through a medium, its speed changes. The formula I remember is v = c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed would normally be c divided by n. But wait, this is when the glass is stationary. But in this problem, the glass is moving.

Hmm, so I'm a bit confused here. How does the motion of the medium affect the speed of light in it? I think the key here is whether the medium's motion affects the local speed of light. Because according to Einstein's theory of relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum is constant regardless of the source's motion. But wait, this is in a medium, so maybe that doesn't apply directly.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So the light is moving through a moving medium. I think this is a problem in the realm of relativistic velocity addition, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me recall the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). Wait, but in this
