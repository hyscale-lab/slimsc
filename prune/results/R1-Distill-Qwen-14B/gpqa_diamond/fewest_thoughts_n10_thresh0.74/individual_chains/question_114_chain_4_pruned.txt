Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. The reactions are given in a two-step process. Let me break them down.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Then it's reacted with NaCN and A to form the product.

Second reaction: The product from the first step, 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B and water to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

So, the question is asking me to choose the correct reagents A and B from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing different combinations of A and B.

I think I need to figure out what kind of reactions are happening here. Let me consider the first reaction. Butanone reacting with NaCN. Wait, butanone is a ketone, and NaCN is a nitrile source. Oh, right, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So, the NaCN would act as a nucleophile here. 

Wait, but when a ketone reacts with a nitrile, what happens? Oh, wait, I might be mixing things up. Let me think. Oh, wait, wait. Another possibility is that maybe the reaction is forming an addition product. Since NaCN is a source of CN- ions, the ketone (butan-2-one) would react with CN- in a nucleophilic addition.

So, the ketone has a carbonyl group, which is attacked by CN- (from NaCN). The product would be a cyanohydrin. Wait, what's a cyanohydrin? Oh, right, a cyanohydrin is when a nitrile group (CN) adds to a carbonyl group, and the oxygen becomes an alcohol (OH). So the product would have both an OH and CN group attached to the same carbon.

But in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures to visualize.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a four-carbon chain with the ketone on C2. So when it reacts with NaCN, the CN- will attack the carbonyl carbon, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, water (H2O) would protonate, and then maybe take a hydrogen somewhere? Or perhaps the reaction is done under acidic conditions to protonate the OH group.

Wait, but what's reagent A? In the first reaction, the product has both a hydroxyl and nitrile group on the same carbon. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. The general reaction for a ketone plus CN- in an aqueous acidic solution produces a cyanohydrin. Because the formation of the cyanohydrin typically requires an acid catalyst. 

Wait, so perhaps reagent A is an acid, like H3O+ (which is what option A and B have as A). Or maybe it's something else like NaHSO3 (sulfuric acid's sodium salt, which is in options C and D).

Wait, but let me think about the mechanism. The formation of cyanohydrin involves the attack of CN- on the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl oxygen then picks up a proton, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is done under acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. Or maybe the reaction uses HCN, but in this case, NaCN is used, so the CN- is in solution.

But for the formation of the cyanohydrin, I think the reaction is typically done under
