Okay, so I have this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth at a very high speed. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is one of those relativistic effects, right?

The astronaut is 22 years old, and I guess we're supposed to find out how long the trip would take from their perspective, not from Earth's perspective, because the options are given in years from the astronaut's point of view. Oh wait, the question says "from the point of view of the astronaut", so that's important.

Wait, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987*c. That's super close to the speed of light. I think that would mean significant time dilation. Let me recall the time dilation formula. I think it's the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Since v is so close to c, gamma will be a large number. Let me compute it. Let's see, v is 0.99999987c. Let's square that: v² = (0.99999987)^2 c². So 0.99999987 squared is approximately. Let me calculate that. 0.99999987 is about 1 - 1.3e-7. Squared, that's approximately (1 - 2.6e-7), because (a - b)^2 is a^2 - 2ab + b^2, and since b is very small, the b squared term is negligible. So v² ≈ (1 - 2.6e-7)c². Then 1 - v²/c² is 2.6e-7. So 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) is 1/sqrt(2.6e-7) approximately.

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Hmm, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so sqrt(2.
