Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with Compound A (C3H6). So, A is probably an alkene or something else. Let's jot down each step and see what's happening.

1. Compound A (C3H6) undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form B. Bromination in CCl4 usually suggests an addition reaction. Wait, but wait—what's the structure of A? C3H6 could be propene (propylene, CH₂=CHCH3) or cyclopropane. Since cyclopropane is less likely to undergo bromination via addition, I think A is propene.

So, propene (CH₂=CHCH3) undergoing bromination would typically add bromine across the double bond. But wait, in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent, the reaction is probably an addition, not substitution. So B would be 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Propene has a double bond between C1 and C2. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound B.

2. Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Alcoholic KOH is a base, often used in elimination reactions. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When you treat a dihalide with KOH in alcohol, it typically undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. So which alkene would we get here? The possible alkenes from 1,2-dibromopropane would be propene again, but wait, maybe it's different. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane reacting with alcoholic KOH could eliminate two HBr molecules. Let's see: The structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When we eliminate, the H and Br from adjacent carbons would leave, forming a double bond. So each Br is on C1 and C2. Removing H from C2 and Br from C1 would give CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be. Wait, elimination would form a double bond. So the possible products are 1-prop
