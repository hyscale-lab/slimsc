Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay question, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem describes a decay process where two heavy nucleons of flavor A decay into two of flavor B, while emitting two lighter particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Then, there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, one exotic, massless particle M is emitted. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E changes in this new scenario compared to the original.

Hmm. I remember that in nuclear decays, especially beta decays, the emitted particles' energy spectra can be continuous or discrete depending on whether other particles are involved. For example, in beta decay, when a neutron turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino, the electron has a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy.

Wait, in the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. The E's have a continuous spectrum, which suggests that V must be some particle that allows energy sharing. Maybe V is a neutrino or something similar. Because when two particles are emitted, each can take any energy as long as the total is conserved, leading to a continuous spectrum.

In the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. Let me think about the energy conservation. Each E and V would carry away some energy. Since the E's have a continuous spectrum, that implies that the energy isn't fixed, so perhaps V is a massive particle, but maybe not? Or maybe the V's are such that their emission allows for a range of energies for E.

Now, in the variant, instead of two V particles, a single M is emitted. M is described as exotic and massless. So 2V → M. Since M is massless, like a photon or a neutrino, it would carry away energy and momentum, but without any rest mass.

Wait, how does the emission of a single massless particle affect the energy spectrum of E?

In the original case, with two V particles, perhaps each V could carry energy, allowing the E particles to have a range of energies. But when you emit a single M, which is massless, perhaps the energy sharing is different.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think about how the energy spectrum is determined. In the case of two-body decay, like a nucleus decaying into two particles, the decay products would have a discrete energy if they are the only products. But when more particles are emitted, the energy becomes continuous.

Wait, but the original process emits two E and two V. So four particles in total. So the E's have a continuous spectrum because there's more than one other particle to share energy with. That makes sense. Because when you have multiple particles emitted, the energy can be shared in different ways, leading to continuous energy distributions.

In the variant scenario, we have two E and one M. So three particles in total. Now, I'm thinking that
