Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We're supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are A, B, C, D, with different values.

Hmm. So first, I'm thinking about what the minimum energy configuration would look like. Since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, they should repel each other. But wait, in this case, 12 are fixed at a distance of 2 meters from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th must be fixed, and the other 12 are fixed at 2 meters from it.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says the 13th is fixed at P. The other 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 is at a distance 2 m from P, but can they move? Or are they fixed at that point? Hmm, the exact wording is "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." That suggests that each can be anywhere on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 m centered at P. But since the system is isolated and we're looking for minimum energy, I think the configuration that minimizes the potential energy is when the charges are as close as possible to each other, but subject to their constraints.

Wait no, wait. Because all the charges are positive, since each is 2e, and e is the elementary charge. So they repel each other. To minimize the potential energy of the system, the charges should be placed as close together as possible, right? Because potential energy between like charges is positive and increases with distance. So to minimize, you want the charges as close as possible, but in this case, the 12 are fixed at 2 m from P. So each of these 12 is 2 m away from the 13th charge at P.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at 2 m from P, but their positions among themselves can vary. So perhaps the minimum potential energy occurs when these 12 are placed as close as possible to each other
