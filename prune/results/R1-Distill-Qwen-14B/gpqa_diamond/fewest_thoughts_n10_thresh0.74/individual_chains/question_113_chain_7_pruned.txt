Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound could be one of four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. The data provided includes FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry results.

First, I'll try to break down each piece of data and see what it tells me about the structure.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, often around 3000. However, another possibility is an alcohol. Or maybe even a ketone or something else, but I think the broad peak is more likely an O-H. But let's not stop there. There are also strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. Hmm, those are in the regions where carbonyl groups absorb. The 1700 is probably a C=O stretch, maybe a carbonyl like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic carbonyl compound, or maybe an amide. But wait, the presence of both might suggest something else. Alternatively, maybe one is from a carbonyl and the other from conjugation, like an ester or a ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or perhaps an aromatic ring. So the compound likely has a double bond or aromatic structure.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment. For example, CH3CHO (acetaldehyde) has a fragment at m/z 45, but wait, that's the molecular ion maybe. Alternatively, a methyl group attached to something else? Or maybe a ketone fragment. Alternatively, the (CH2O) group. Wait, 45 is 12 + 2*1 + 16*2? Wait, 12 is C, 2 H is 2, 16*2 is 32. 12+2+32=46. Oh, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, 12 (C) + 3 (H) + 16*2 (O2) would be 12 +3 +32=47, which isn't 45. Hmm. Maybe it's a CH2O group? That would be 12 +2 +16=30. No, not 45. Wait, what fragments have m/z 4
