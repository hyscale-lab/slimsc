Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The setup is that we have an atom that's supposed to decay with a probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it would have decayed. Now, we're told that 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. The question is, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?

Hmm. Wait, but 150 minutes after what? Oh, because the question says "the next 150 minutes," I think it's referring to the remaining time after the initial 50 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the decay probability given is for 100 minutes, so maybe I need to find the probability over 200 minutes.

Wait, but no, the initial monitoring started at time zero, and after 50 minutes, it's still intact. So the question is, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes (so by 200 minutes)?

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability that a nucleus decays in a given time period is independent of its age. So, the fact that it hasn't
