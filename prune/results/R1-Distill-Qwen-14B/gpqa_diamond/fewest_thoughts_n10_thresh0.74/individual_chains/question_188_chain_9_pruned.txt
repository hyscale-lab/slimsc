Okay, so I've got this crystallography question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the lattice vectors are of equal length, but the angles between them are all the same but not necessarily 90 degrees. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. Oh, that's pretty sharp, not the usual 90 for a cube.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, wait. In a crystal, the lattice vectors define the unit cell. So for a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a three-dimensional figure with all sides equal and all angles equal. 

But wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms, right? So in a simple cubic structure, that's the same as the lattice parameter a. But rhombohedral might be a bit more complex. Or wait, is the interatomic distance the same as the lattice parameter in this case? Because sometimes the structure can have more atoms, but I'm not sure. Maybe in this problem, the interatomic distance is a, the lattice constant. Oh, I think that's probably the case. So a is 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh, right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula I remember is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cosγ) + 2(hl cosβ) + 2(kl cosα) ) ), but wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, maybe I should think about the general formula for interplanar distances in a crystal with lattice parameters.

Wait, in a general case where the lattice isn't cubic, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by the formula:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² / a²) + (k² / b²) + (l² / c²) - 2(hk (cos αβ) / (a b)) + ... wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = [ (a² (
