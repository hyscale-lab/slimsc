Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. The options are about how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, okay, first, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the reaction conditions matter. Oh right, the amount is one equivalent, so it's a complete epoxidation, not any further reaction or anything like that.

So Reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Reaction 2 is (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Then each is treated with aqueous acid. Oh right, when epoxides are treated with acid, they undergo ring-opening. But how?

Epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions typically involves the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (like water, since it's aqueous acid, maybe H+ and water?) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stable if the leaving group is on the less substituted.

Wait, but waitâ€”epoxide ring-opening under acid usually leads to the formation of a diol. Each epoxide would open in a certain way. But since the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxide structures will differ.

Let me think about the structure of oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So, (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents (CH2CH2CH2CH3) on opposite sides. When epoxidized, the oxygen will form a three-membered ring across the double bond, making an epoxide.

Then, when treated with acid, this epoxide will protonate and open. Let's consider the stereochemistry. For an epoxide to open, the nucleophile attacks the less substituted carbon? Or the more substituted? I think it's the more substituted because in acid, the more substituted carbon is more stable when the leaving group departs. Wait, no, maybe it's the less substituted because the epoxide's oxygen is more stabilized there. Hmm, I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember that when epoxides are opened under acidic conditions, the nucleophile tends to attack the more substituted carbon because the positive charge is more stabilized there. That's the same as the more substituted carbon being more electrophilic.

Wait, but the actual attack is on the less substituted because the more substituted would be more stabilized. No, wait, the more substituted carbon has more adjacent R groups, so when the epoxide oxygen is protonated, the adjacent carbons become positively polarized. The nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon because that would lead to a more stable carbocation (or at least a more stable transition state).

Wait, but in
