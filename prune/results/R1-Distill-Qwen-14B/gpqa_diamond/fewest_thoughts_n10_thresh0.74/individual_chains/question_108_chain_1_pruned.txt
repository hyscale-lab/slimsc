Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that paramagnetic effects have something to do with the magnetic properties of materials due to unpaired electrons, but I'm not exactly sure how that ties into the problem.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis, which I think is the z-axis. And it's a small value of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, m can be -1, 0, +1 for p orbitals, maybe? Or depends on the orbital type. So small m might mean that the effects are minimal, but I'm not certain.

The magnetic field strength is given as 1 Tesla. I know that 1 Tesla is a strong magnetic field, like the kind you find in an MRI machine. But how does that relate to the energy terms?

The problem asks me to compare the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field, with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers, which I recognize as the wavelength for the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line. So that transition is from n=3 to n=2, I think. The energy ΔE would come from that transition.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩—what's that? Paramagnetic coupling in atoms can arise from the interaction between the magnetic moments of electrons and the external magnetic field. Oh right! The Zeeman effect comes into play here. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H_Zeeman = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but in the case of orbital magnetization, the magnetic moment comes from the orbital angular momentum L. So maybe it's μ = (e/(2m)) * L, or something along those lines.

Wait, another approach: the energy shift due to the magnetic field for an atom with orbital angular momentum l would be given by something like ⟨H⟩ = (μ_B * B * m_l) / something. Maybe the formula is ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * B * m, where m is the magnetic
