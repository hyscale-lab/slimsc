Okay, so I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectral data. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on spectroscopy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNy. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m - x - y)/2. So n=9, m=11, x=2, y=1.

Calculating: (2*9+2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20-14)/2 = 6/2=3. So three degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3, but wait, benzene is 3, right? So maybe a benzene ring plus another double bond or ring or something else. Hmm.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, probably from -NH stretching. So amide or amine groups maybe. Also, a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl group. Could be ester, amide, ketone, etc. So possible functional groups here.

Now the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, the triplet suggests coupling with a neighboring CH2, so maybe an ethyl group attached to something else. Like OCH2CH3.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH group, maybe in an amide or amine. Wait, but if it's a singlet and broad, perhaps it's an NH that's not exchanging? Or maybe a CH2 next to an electronegative atom. Hmm, not sure yet.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H suggests maybe another CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Like OCH2CH2O or something. Wait, quartet for 2H would have a neighboring group with two protons? Or perhaps another splitting. Maybe it's a CH2 next to another CH2 that's split into a quartet.

7.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. 8.0 ppm, doublet, 2H. Those are aromatic protons, probably a para-substituted benzene. The doublets suggest two sets of two protons each, probably in a para arrangement. So like two substituents on the ring, in the para positions.

Putting this together, the structure has a benzene ring with substituents. The two substituents might be an ethoxy group and another group with a carbonyl. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be a benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But benzamide is CONH2 attached to the benzene. Wait, no, benzamide is a benzene ring with a CONH2 group. But 3-ethoxy would mean an ethoxy at position 3. But wait, the NMR shows an NH in the 4.0 ppm as a singletâ€”maybe that's an amide NH. But benzamide would have an NH2 group, which would show up as a broad peak maybe. Alternatively, if it's a substituted amide, perhaps.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONH2. So substituting on the phenyl ring at position 4 with ethoxy, and the formamide group attached to the N. So the structure would be O=C(OH)-N-Ph-OEt? Wait, formamide is HCO-NH2. So the formamide would have a structure where the amide is attached to the benzene. So the substituents on the benzene would be 4-ethoxy and the formamide group. Wait, but the molecular formula? Let's check: 4-ethoxyphenyl has C6H4-OCH2CH3. Then formamide is HCONH. So the compound would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. The formula would be C8H7NO2 plus the ethoxy (which is C2H5O), so C10? Wait, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the molecular formula of option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The formamide is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the formula would be: HCONH-(Ph-OEt). So benzene (6C) + ethoxy (2C) + formamide (1C, from HCO). So 6+2+1=9C? Wait, but ethoxy is OCH2CH3 which is 2C. So 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide) = 9C? Yes. Then H: benzene has 5H (since two substituents), ethoxy has 5H (CH2CH3), formamide has 1H in HCO. Wait, maybe it's better to count:

Formamide: HCONH-R. R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formula would be C6H5-O-CH2CH3 + HCONH-.

So C6 (Ph) + OCH2CH3 (C2) + HCONH (C1). So 6+2+1=9 C.

Hydrogens: Ph with substituents at 4 and attached to formamide. Wait, maybe the total would be C9H11NO2?

Let me see: each substituent on benzene takes a H. So Ph-OCH2CH3 has 5 H on benzene (since two substituents, para). The ethoxy group has 5 H (CH2CH3). The formamide part would have the H from HCO (1H) and the NH (which is 1H). Wait, but in the compound, the formamide is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the NH would be part of the substituent.

But the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let's see:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2? Wait, no. Benzene (C
