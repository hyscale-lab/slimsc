Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. 

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and I need to find the mean decay distance. The given values are production energy E_X =8 GeV, mass m_X=1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X=320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. So first, I should probably find the lifetime of the meson. Then, multiply that by the velocity to get the distance.

But wait, how do I find the lifetime? Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy (which relates to the width Γ) and the uncertainty in time (the lifetime τ) are connected by ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). But I think it's more precise to say Γ is the total decay width, and τ is the mean lifetime, which is ħ/(Γ). Or wait, isn't Γ the total decay rate, so Γ = ħ/τ. So τ = ħ/(Γ).

Wait, Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in units of MeV·s or something? Let me get the units straight. ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, but GeV is 1e3 MeV. So 6.582e-25 GeV·s is the same as 6.582e-25 *1e3 MeV·s = 6.582e-22 MeV·s. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me convert ħ into MeV·s.

Wait, 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV. So ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s
