Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of coupling constants determines renormalizability. Let's think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think, since it's antisymmetric as well.

First, I need to determine the mass dimensions of each field and the coupling κ. Because the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions (as it's integrated over spacetime, and action is dimensionless).

So the Lagrangian is L = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break down each component.

The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, fermions like Dirac spinors have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ would also have 3/2 since it's the adjoint.

σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of γ matrices. Each γ matrix has dimension 0 (they're just matrices, not fields). So [γ_μ, γ_ν] has dimension 0. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless? Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of field tensor components. Hmm, perhaps I should think about how the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ contributes.

Wait, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ is a scalar (since σ is antisymmetric, but when you contract with F^{μν}, which is also antisymmetric, it should give a scalar). So the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have the same dimensions as (ψ̄ ψ) multiplied by something else? No, wait. Let's compute the dimensions.

Each ψ has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. But σ_{μν} is constructed from γ matrices, which are dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ μν ψ must have dimension 3. Wait, no, because σ_{μν} is an object of dimension 0 (since it's made from γ matrices which are dim 0), so ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be (3/2)*2 = 3? Because ψ̄ is 3/2, σ is 0, ψ is 3/2. So 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. So the term ψ̄ σψ has dimension 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which is the derivative of the gauge field A, so dimension 1 (because derivatives are dimension 1), and since F^μν is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, each A is dimension 1. So F has dimension 2? Wait, no, wait. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1. So each derivative ∂ has dimension 1. F is made from derivatives of A, so ∂μ Aν has dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together, L_int = κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F. The dimension of (ψ̄ σ ψ) is 3, F is 2. So the product is dimension 3 + 2 =5. Since the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4, κ must have dimension 4 -
