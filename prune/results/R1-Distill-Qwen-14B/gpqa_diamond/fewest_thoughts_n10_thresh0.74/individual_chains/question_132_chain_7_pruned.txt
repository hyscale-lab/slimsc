Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through carefully. Let me see what the question says.

The problem is about a solution that's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each integrating for 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds from the options are present.

The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene. Let me list them:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene
2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4. 1,4-diethylbenzene

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D, each pairing two of these compounds.

Hmm. Let's think about the NMR signals. So, the aromatic region has two singlets at 6.7 ppm. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each singlet must come from each compound, and each must have only one type of aromatic proton. So each compound has all equivalent aromatic protons, resulting in a singlet.

For a benzene ring with multiple substituents, when all the aromatic protons are equivalent, it's called para-substituted? Or maybe all substituents are in a symmetrical arrangement. Wait, maybe each compound has all aromatic protons equivalent, so their NMR shows a singlet. So each compound in the mixture must have all aromatic Hs equivalent.

Wait, let's think about each of the options.

First, let's consider the aromatic regions. For each compound, how many unique H environments are there?

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: Let me draw the structure. So the benzene ring has methyl groups at positions 1,2,4,5. Wait, that's like two pairs of adjacent methyl groups. So the substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So numbering the ring clockwise: 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), then 3 (H), 4 (methyl), 5 (methyl), 6 (H). Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene has six positions. If 1,2,4,5 are substituted, that's four substituents. Let me think about the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So the arrangement would be:

Positions 1: CH3
2: CH3
3: H
4: CH3
5: CH3
6: H

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Maybe it's more symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical, leading to equivalent protons.

Wait, 1,2,4,5
