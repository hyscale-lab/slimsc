Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so maybe I can work through each and see which one fits.

First, I remember that in a 1D infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is the ground state energy when n=1. So each energy level for a particle is E_n = n² * E, right? Because E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, and so on.

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2, which means they are fermions. So the Pauli exclusion principle applies here. Fermions must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin. In a one-dimensional well, each energy level can hold a certain number of particles based on their spin states.

Wait, in 1D, the quantum numbers are just the principal quantum number n and the spin. For spin-1/2, each particle can have spin up or down. So each energy level E_n can hold 2 particles—one for each spin state.

So for four particles, I need to fill the lowest energy levels, considering the exclusion principle. Let's think about how the particles fill up the states.

The ground state would be the lowest possible energy arrangement. So we start filling the lowest n levels.

But wait, in the ground state, how do the particles arrange themselves? Each n can have two particles because of the two spin states. So let's start filling:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: another 2 (since two spin states)
Wait, but wait, wait. No, wait. Because each n has a degeneracy of 2 (since spin up and down are different states). So for each n, 2 particles can occupy that level.

So four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So in the ground state, all four particles are filled in the lowest two energy levels, each with two particles.

Wait, but what about the energy of each particle? So each particle in the same n contributes E_n to the total energy. So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

But wait, each particle in n=1 has energy E_1 = 1² E = E. There are two such particles. Similarly, each in n=2 has E_2 = 4E. Two particles there as well. So the total energy for the ground state would be 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm getting confused. Because for four particles, the first two go into n=1, each with spin up and down. The next two would go into n=2, each spin up and down. So the energies are summing as E1 for two particles and E2 for two.

So ground state energy is 2E + 2*4E = 2
