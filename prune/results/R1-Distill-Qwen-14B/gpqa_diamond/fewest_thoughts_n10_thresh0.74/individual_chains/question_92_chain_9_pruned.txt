Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, the problem gives me some bond energies instead of the formation values. Oh right, maybe I can use bond energies to calculate the enthalpy of formation.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, it looks like a molecule with two double bonds. The formula would have a bunch of carbons and hydrogens. Let me count them. Each (CH3)2C= part is a propene-like group, but maybe it's a longer chain with multiple branches and double bonds.

Wait, I think I need to figure out the molecular formula first. Let's break it down. Each (CH3)2C=CH- is like a substituent. Let me see:

Each (CH3)2C=CH- is a group where the central carbon is connected to two CH3, a double bond, and a CH- part. So that would be each substituent having 3 carbons (the C with two CH3, one CH2, and another CH). Hmm, maybe I should count each part.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about the entire molecule. Let's see:

Looking at the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH
