Alright, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Okay, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I'm not sure if the masses matter here. The problem is about their elemental abundances, so maybe the masses just tell us something about the type of stars, but perhaps not directly involved in the calculations. I'll keep that in mind just in case.

The given data are their elemental abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So Star_1 has the same metallicity as the Sun because [Fe/H] is 0, meaning [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - Sun's log(nFe/nH) = 0. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So let me compute that. Subtract 12: log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Wait, 10^-4 is 0.0001, so 10^-4.5 is about 3.16e-5. So nFe is 3.16e-5 per H in the Sun.

Similarly, for Mg, the Sun's 12 + log10(nMg/nH) is 7. So log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5. So nMg in the Sun is 10^-5 per H.

Wait, no. Wait, 12 + log10(nX/nH) = value. So for Fe, 12 + log(Fe/H) =7.5. So log(Fe/H) = 7.5-12 = -4.5. So Fe/H is 10^-4.5, which is about 3.16e-5.

Same for Mg: log
