Okay, so I have this question about which planet is more likely to transit, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break this down. 

So, the question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They were detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, and both have circular orbits. 

The stars: Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But wait, both host stars have the same radii because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. Hmm, same radius but different masses. Interesting.

The main goal is to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should choose that one since they want the highest chance.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the orbital inclination relative to our line of sight. More specifically, the probability (P) is given by P = R_star / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5), but since both orbits are circular, e is zero so it simplifies to P = R_star / a. Wait, but wait—no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Actually, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (a). So, P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no. The formula I think I remember is that the geometric probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since Earth-like planets are much smaller than stars, R_planet is negligible. So it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, but wait—that's not quite right either. Let me get this straight. The transit probability is proportional to the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth compared to the area of the planet's orbit. The geometric probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), but it's actually (R_star / a), but only if the orbit is edge-on. Otherwise, it doesn't transit.

Wait, more accurately, the probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor that accounts for the alignment. Oh wait, the maximum possible probability for a planet to transit is (R_star / a) because the planet has to be in the right orbital
