Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a type of chemical mutagen that causes point mutations, mostly substitutions. So the mutants probably have small changes in their gene sequence.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That likely means the gene product (maybe an enzyme) is no longer functional. So the mutation probably disrupts the gene's function, perhaps through a frameshift or a stop codon.

Looking at the options, the question provides four mutants (1-4) and the intact gene. Each mutant has a change in the beginning of the first exon.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, comparing to the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCTC... So in Mutant 1, after ATG, it's TTCTACGCT... Wait, let me break it down:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant 1: ATG TCT AC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Hmm, so between positions 5-8 maybe? Let me count the letters. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution. Let me compare each position.

Intact: positions 1-20 (approx):
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
7: TCT
8: GTG
9: GAT
10: GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C... Hmm. So maybe at position 3, the CTC in the intact becomes TCT? Or wait, looking for changes:

Wait, the first part of the intact gene is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT AC GCT GGT ACT TCT... So the first few codons change. Let me write them out.

Intact:
ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)...

Mutant 1:
ATG (start)
TCT (Ser)
ACG (Thr? No, ACG is Thr? Wait, no. ACG is Thr, but wait, in the mutant, maybe it's a frameshift? No, because the rest of the sequence is longer
