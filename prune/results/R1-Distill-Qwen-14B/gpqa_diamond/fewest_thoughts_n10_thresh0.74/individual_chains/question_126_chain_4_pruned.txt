Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the question involves two reactions done by an organic chemist. The products are then combined, and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks each will show. Hmm.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does. Let's tackle Reaction I and II one by one.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH, then acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. When reduced, it should become a secondary alcohol. The structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the molecule is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no. Let me draw the structure properly.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no: hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. Wait, maybe better to count the carbons. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2CO... Wait, hexane is six carbons. So position 3 is the third carbon. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait: 1, 2, 3. So, carbon 3 has the carbonyl. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me number them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, position 3 is the carbonyl. So, it's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, that would be pentyl groups on either side of the carbonyl. Wait, no, maybe it's CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, that can't be right
