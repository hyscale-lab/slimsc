Okay, let's try to tackle this question. Hmm, it's about organic chemistry reactions and NMR spectroscopy. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

So, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When you dehydrate that, you get an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually aromatic or something deshielded. But the 13C NMR has two peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. 165 is probably a carbonyl, maybe an anhydride's carbonyl. 137 might be a carbon attached to an oxygen, like an ether or maybe part of the ring structure.

The anhydride then reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Oh, that's a diene with four methyl groups. The reaction probably forms a bridged structure, like a Diels-Alder adduct since that's a common reaction between dienes and dienophiles. The products have the molecular formula C13H16O3, which makes sense if the anhydride contributes some carbonyl groups and the diene adds the rest.

The major and minor products have their NOESY spectra taken. The major has a cross-peak, minor doesn't. NOESY detects through-space proximity, so that means in the major product, two protons are close to each other, like on adjacent carbons or in a certain spatial arrangement.

Looking at the options for which resonances are connected. Let's think about the structure. The starting anhydride must be something like a bicyclic structure, perhaps. Wait, the dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene would form an anhydride where the two carboxylic acid groups lose water to form an anhydride bridge. Maybe it's a cyclic anhydride, like a five-membered ring?

The 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. For a cyclic anhydride, maybe thereâ€™s an aromatic ring? Or perhaps it's a conjugated diene or a carbonyl next to something that causes the protons to be deshielded. Alternatively, maybe the 7 ppm is due to an alpha proton to carbonyl groups. But in an anhydride, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are usually around 2-3 ppm. Hmm, maybe it's not an aromatic proton. Alternatively, perhaps the 7 ppm is from an amide or something else, but the question says it's an anhydride.

Wait, another thought: maybe the 7 ppm proton is part of a bridge structure. Like in a bicyclic compound. The anhydride is a cyclic one. When it reacts with the diene, perhaps it forms a Diels-Alder adduct with a bridge, leading to a bicyclic structure where some protons are close in space.

Now, when the Diels
