Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about two reactions where a chemist uses different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. My task is to figure out what the starting materials A and B are, based on the options given.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I should understand what each reaction is doing. Both reactions are reductions because they involve reducing agents. The products are both cyclic ketones, so the starting materials must have been something that can be reduced to form a ketone. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride reducing agents, which are typically used to reduce carbonyl groups to alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product is a ketone. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait no, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because if the product is a ketone, perhaps the starting material was a more oxidized group, like an ester or a lactone?

Wait, wait. Let me think. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, an ester group (RCOOR') would be reduced to RCH2O-R' (or maybe RCH2OH if it's an ester with an alcohol). But in the product, it's a tetrahydro pyranone. Tetrahydro pyranone is a cyclic ether with a ketone. Oh wait, perhaps the starting material is a lactone, which upon reduction would open the ring and form a diol, but that doesn't directly lead to a ketone. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Let me draw the structure. It's a six-membered ring (pyran) where two of the positions are a ketone and an ethyl group. The ring is saturated (tetrahydro), so it's a cyclohexane ring with a lactone-like structure, but in this case, it's a cyclic hemiacetal or similar.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed
