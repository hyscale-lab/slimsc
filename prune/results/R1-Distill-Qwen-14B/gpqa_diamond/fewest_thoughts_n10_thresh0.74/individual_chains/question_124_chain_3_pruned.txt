Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particles in a detector. Let me try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. The particles produced are new types that decay quickly. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking: What Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls? The options are A) 54, B) 68, C)40, D)28.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the relationship between the particles' speed, their lifetime, and how far they travel before decaying. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, time dilation must be a factor here.

Wait, in relativity, the lifetime of the particle as measured in the lab frame (where the detector is) is longer than its proper lifetime. So, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So, the particles' lifetime τ is dilated by the Lorentz factor γ. So, the lab frame sees a lifetime γ times longer than τ.

The distance a particle can travel before decaying is the speed multiplied by the lifetime. Since they are moving at a high speed, but the key here is that the particles are ultra-relativistic, so their velocity is approximately the speed of light. So, for calculation purposes, maybe we can approximate their velocity v as c.

Wait, but the problem says they're traveling at ultra-relativistic velocities, but the initial Lorentz factor is 20. So, let me think: the Lorentz factor γ is given by γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So, when γ is 20, the velocity v is such that γ is 20. But for ultra-relativistic speeds, v is very close to c. So, perhaps for simplification, we can treat v as approximately c, which would make the math easier. But I'm not sure yet.

So, the main idea is that the particles are produced at the center of the detector, and they fly outward. The ones that reach the inner walls are those that don't decay before traveling a distance equal to the radius of the detector. So, the probability of a particle reaching the wall depends on the ratio of the time it takes to reach the wall compared to its lifetime.

Wait, but how does the Lorentz factor affect the distance they can travel? Let me think. Since the lifetime is γτ, the distance they can travel is v * γτ. Since v is approximately c, the distance is roughly c * γτ.

But wait, the problem states that when γ is 20, one third of them reach the detector walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. So, the mean distance they can travel is 30 meters, but only a fraction (one third) of the particles live long enough to reach that distance.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the decay. The number of particles that decay before traveling a distance L is given
