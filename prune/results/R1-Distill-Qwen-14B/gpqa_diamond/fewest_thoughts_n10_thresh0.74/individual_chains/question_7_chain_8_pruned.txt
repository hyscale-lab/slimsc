Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by the process gamma-gamma → e+ e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are in the range of 1e5 GeV, which is really high energy, so I'm thinking this is probably related to gamma-ray attenuation or something like that.

Wait, I remember that in the early universe, high-energy photons can interact with the CMB. The process is like a photon-photon collision producing electron-positron pairs. So the lifetime of a gamma-ray would be determined by the probability of it annihilating via this process. If the probability is high enough, the gamma-ray won't travel far before annihilating, hence its lifetime is limited.

So, the lifetime limit is when the mean free time (the average time between interactions) is comparable to the age of the universe or something like that. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula here. Maybe I should think about the relation between the gamma-ray energy and the cross-section for this annihilation process.

The cross-section for photon-photon annihilation probably depends on the energy of the photons. I remember that the cross-section for pair production (γγ → e+e-) increases with the energy of the photons. The formula might involve the square of the logarithm of the energy ratio or something like that.

Alternatively, the threshold energy for this process is when the combined energy of the two photons is enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. Oh right, the threshold condition is that the center-of-mass energy must be at least twice the electron mass. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so the combined energy needs to be at least that.

Wait, but in this case, one photon is a high-energy gamma, and the other is a CMB photon at 1e-3 eV. The gamma's energy is Eγ, and the CMB photon is E_cmb=1e-3 eV.

The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (Eγ + E_cmb)^2 - (pγ c + p_cmb c)^2. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions, so the spatial part would subtract. Hmm, but wait, for photons, E = pc, so for each photon, p = E/(c). Let me think. Let me denote the gamma's 4-momentum as (Eγ, pγ c) where pγ = Eγ/(c), and the CMB photon's as (E_cmb, p_cmb c), with p_cmb = E_cmb / c.

Wait, but in choosing the frame where the gamma is moving along, say, the positive x-direction, and the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction, so their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total 3-momentum would be (Eγ/c - E_cmb/c) in the x-direction, and zero in y and z.

So the square of the total 4-momentum is (Eγ + E_cmb)^2 - (Eγ/c - E_cmb/c)^2 c^2. Let me compute that.

= (Eγ + E_cmb)^2 - ( (Eγ - E_cmb)/c )^2 c^2
= (Eγ + E_cmb)^2 - (Eγ - E_cmb)^2
Expanding both terms:

= [Eγ² + 2 Eγ E_cmb + E_cmb²] - [Eγ² - 2 Eγ E_cmb + E_cmb²]
= Eγ² + 2 Eγ E_cmb + E_cmb² - Eγ² + 2 Egamma E_cmb - E_cmb²
= 4 Egamma E_cmb.

So the invariant squared s is 4 Egamma E_cmb. For the process to happen, the center-of-mass energy must be at least twice the electron mass, m_e c².

So s ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2. Therefore,

4 Egamma E_cmb ≥ (2 m_e c²)^2

Dividing both sides by 4:

Egamma E_cmb ≥ (m_e c² )^2

So,

Egamma ≥ (m_e c² )^2 / E_cmb.

Wait, that's the threshold condition. But wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Yes, because for s = (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2 = 4 Egamma E_cmb if the photons are moving in opposite directions. So for the process to be possible, their combined energy must be at least 2 m_e c². So Egamma E_cmb must be (m_e c²)^2.

But in this problem, E_cmb is given as 1e
