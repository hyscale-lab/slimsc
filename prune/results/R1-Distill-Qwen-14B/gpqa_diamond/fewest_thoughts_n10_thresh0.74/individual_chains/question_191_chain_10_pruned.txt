Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question describes a series of reactions starting from 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. I'll need to figure out what each step does to the molecule to find out what product 4 looks like.

First, the starting material: 3-(hydroxymethyl) means there's a CH2OH group on carbon 3. The 5-(prop-1-en-2-yl) group is a substituent on carbon 5. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C(CH2) group, wait no—propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)-, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)CH– attached via the double bond. Oh wait, no, the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–C(=CH2)–? Hmm, no, maybe it's CH2–C(CH2–), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is the group CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, no. Let me clarify. Prop-1-en-2-yl is (CH2)2C=, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, prop-1-ene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is the group from the double bond. So the substituent would be CH2–C(CH2–), but perhaps it's better to think of it as a vinyl group attached to a methyl. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2–C(=CH2)–. So, the substituent is an allyl group attached at position 2, so prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–C(CH2–), maybe as a substituent like CH2–C(CH2–)–. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of the substituent as an isopropenyl group. Because prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2
