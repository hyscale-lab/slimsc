Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle in a potential. Let's see what I can do. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says the particle is in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential. I remember that in 3D, the potential is similar to the 1D case but with r squared. So the force here is Hookean, obeying F = -kr, which makes sense for a harmonic oscillator.

The problem is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy. Hmm. I think I need to figure out the quantum numbers involved here.

In three dimensions, the energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are given by the formula E = (n + 3/2) ħω, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, in 3D, if it's isotropic, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each direction (x, y, z) has a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, and the total energy is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Wait, but that's the same thing.

Wait, but wait, no. Oh wait, no, maybe in spherical coordinates, the energy levels are different. Wait, but in 3D, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated either in Cartesian coordinates (separable) or in spherical coordinates. Hmm, but for the energy levels, the approach is a bit different depending on the coordinate system.

Wait, wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. In Cartesian coordinates, each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so the total is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the energy levels are E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. The possible values of n are 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. Each n corresponds to a certain energy level
