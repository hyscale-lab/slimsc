Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember that when they talk about [X/Y] notation, it's a logarithmic scale where the value is the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms compared to the Sun's ratio. Oh right, the formula is [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_Sun.

Alright, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses and elemental abundances. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Let me jot down the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12? Wait, wait, no. The Sun's values are given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me think again. The notation is 12 + log10(...) equals a number. So for Fe, it's 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, it's 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7. So log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5. So nMg/nH =10^(-5).

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about how to relate these. Let me think.

I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, ratio = (n_Si, Star_1) / (n_Si, Star_2)

To find n_Si in each star, I think I need to express it in terms of Fe and Mg, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me see. For each star, I can probably express [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si], and use the other given [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] to find the abundances.

Wait, Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0, which means that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So if that's zero, then nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, no. The formula is [X/H] = log10(n_X/n_H) - log10(n_X/n_H)_sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means log10(nFe/nH)_1 = log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is same as in the Sun.

Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg/nH in Star_2 is same as in the Sun.

But wait, Star_2 also has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. So [Mg/Si] is the logarithm of (nMg/nSi) divided by (nMg/nSi)_sun.

Let me try to compute the abundance of Si in each star.

Starting with Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log10(nSi/nFe)_1 - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

Wait, because [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun.

So rearranged, log10(nSi/nFe)_1 = 0.3 + log10(nSi/nFe)_sun.

But wait, I don't know what (nSi/nFe)_sun is. Hmm. Maybe I can express it in terms of other known values.

Wait, the Sun's Fe and Mg are given. But what about Si in the Sun? Hmm. The problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe], so maybe I can calculate it.

Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 10^(7.5-12) = 10^-4.5. Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(7-12) =10^-5. But what about nSi/nH?

Hmm, I don't think the Sun's [Si/Fe] is given. So perhaps I can express nSi in terms of nFe for each star.

Wait, but maybe I can find (nSi/nFe)_sun because I know nFe and nH in the Sun. Wait, but I don't have nSi. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that in the Sun, [Fe/H] is given as part of their photospheric composition. Wait, perhaps I can find (nSi/nH) in the Sun, but the problem doesn't provide it. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the question gives the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but not [Si/H], so I can't directly find Si in the Sun. So maybe I need to make a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of Si in each star relative to H, and then take the ratio between the two stars.

Wait. Let's think. For Star_1, I can find nSi/nH. Because I know [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe/nH is same as Sun. And [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. Wait, [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3.

So, log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But how to find log(nSi/nFe)_sun?

Wait, nFe/nH in the Sun is 10^(-4.5). Let's say the Sun's nFe = K * nH, where K is 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, the Sun's nMg = 10^(-5) * nH.

But what about nSi in the Sun? Without that, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I can express nSi in the Sun in terms of nMg. Oh, wait, because for Star_2, they have [Mg/Si]_2 which I can use to find the ratio. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the ratio of nSi in Star_1 and Star_2 relative to the Sun, and then take the ratio.

Wait, but maybe for Star_1, because [Fe/H] is 0, and [Si/Fe] is 0.3, the abundance of Si is higher than Fe.

So, for Star_1:

log(nSi/nFe)_1 = log(nSi/nFe)_sun + 0.3.

But without knowing (nSi/nFe)_sun, it's hard. Wait, wait a second. The Sun's (nFe/nH) is known, as is (nMg/nH). But without nSi, perhaps I can't proceed that way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the ratio [Si/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H] and [Si/H], because:

[Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H].

Wait, wait, let me check that.

Because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H], right? Because [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Which is equal to [X/H] - [Y/H], because:

[X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log_sun(nX/nH)

[Y/H] = log(nY/nH) - log_sun(nY/nH)

So [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]

So, for Star_1,

[Si/Fe] = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1.

But [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1.

Which means [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So, the abundance of Si relative to H in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3.

[Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] = 0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Hmm, that's interesting. So Star_1 has [Si/H] = 0.3, and Star_2 has [Si/H] = -0.3.

So the ratio of n_Si in Star_1 to Star_2 would be 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)}.

Wait, no. Because [Si/H]_1 is log10(n_Si/n_H)_1 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = 0.3.

Similarly, [Si/H]_2 is log10(n_Si/n_H)_2 - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun = -0.3.

So to find n_Si,1 / n_Si,2 = 10^{([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2)} ?

Wait, let me think. Let me denote [Si/H]_i = log10(n_Si/n_H)_i - log10(n_Si/n_H)_sun.

So, for Star_1:

log10(n_Si,1 / n_H) = log10(n_Si, sun / n_H) + 0.3.

Similarly, Star_2:

log10(n_Si,2 / n_H) = log10(n_Si, sun / n_H) - 0.3.

So, the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = [ (n_Si,1 / n_H) / (n_Si,2 / n_H) ) ] = (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = 10^{ (log10(n_Si,1 / n_H) - log10(n_Si,2 / n_H)) }.

Which is 10^{ [ (log10(n_Si, sun / n_H) + 0.3) ) - (log10(n_Si, sun / n_H) - 0.3) ) ] }.

The log10(n_Si sun/n_H) terms cancel, so it becomes 10^{(0.3 - (-0.3))} = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98, which is approximately 4.

Wait, but wait, the options are A) ~3.9, which is close. So the answer would be A, ~3.9.

But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes the ratio is taken as Star_2 to Star_1 or vice versa. The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So it's (n_Si,1)/(n_Si,2) = ~4, so option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the steps again.

For Star_1: [Si/Fe] = 0.3, [Fe/H] =0.

So [Si/Fe] = [Si/H] - [Fe/H] = [Si/H] - 0 → [Si/H] = 0.3.

So Si is more abundant relative to H than in the Sun.

For Star_2: [Mg/Si] = 0.3, [Mg/H] =0.

[Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H] → [Si/H] = -0.3.

So in Star_2, Si is less abundant than in the Sun.

So the ratio (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) = 10^([Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2) = 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) ) = 10^(0.6) ≈ 3.98.

Which is option A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the logarithmic abundance scale defined as:

\[
[X/Y] = \log_{10}(N_X/N_Y) - \log_{10}(N_X/N_Y)_{\text{Sun}}
\]

### Data for Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex  
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex  

Using the relationship \([X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]\), we find:
\[
[Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1
\]
Since \([Fe/H]_1 = 0\), it follows that:
\[
[Si/H]_1 = 0.3
\]
This means the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than in the Sun.

### Data for Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex  
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex  

Using the same relationship:
\[
[Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2
\]
Since \([Mg/H]_2 = 0\), it follows that:
\[
[Si/H]_2 = -0.3
\]
This means the abundance of silicon relative to hydrogen in Star_2 is 0.3 dex lower than in the Sun.

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 10^{[Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2}
\]
Substituting \([Si/H]_1 = 0.3\) and \([Si/H]_2 = -0.3\):
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si},1}}{n_{\text{Si},2}} = 10^{0.3 - (-0.3)} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**, which corresponds to option **A**.
