Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question is about a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so I think m could be like 0 or 1 or something. The B field is 1 Tesla. I need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the energy associated with the magnetic interaction, with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen.

The transition energy ΔE is given with a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using that formula.

But wait, I also need to find the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the interaction of atomic electrons with an external magnetic field. The energy term for this is usually given by the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (eħ)/(2m_e) * l, where g is the Landé g-factor, e is the charge, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, m_e is the electron mass, and l is the orbital angular momentum.

Alternatively, I think the energy levels split due to the Zeeman effect, so the energy shift would be something like ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Oh wait, the paramagnetic term might be the same as the Zeeman term here.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m comes into play. The energy shift for each level is proportional to m, so the magnitude would depend on m. But the problem states that m is small, but I guess that's okay because the energy would vary with m.

So, let's compute both energies.

First, calculate ΔE from the wavelength given. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Let's compute the energy using E = hc/λ.

Constants:
h = Planck's constant ≈ 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s
c = speed of light ≈ 3 x 10^8 m/s
λ = 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9)
Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25
Denominator: 486.1e-9 = 4.861e-7
So E = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.087e-19 J.

Wait, that's in joules. Let me convert that to electron volts because sometimes these energies are expressed that way. 1 eV is
