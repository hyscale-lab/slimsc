Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the positron and electron are each other's antiparticles, their annihilation would result in gamma rays or photons. But wait, in this case, it's two photons.

Wait, the problem says both photons have the same energy. Oh right, because when matter and antimatter annihilate, they convert their rest mass into energy, and since the photons are massless, their energies would depend on the system's total energy.

But wait, the Lorentz factors are given. Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and length dilate. The electron and positron are moving towards each other, so their energies are higher than their rest mass energies.

So, let's think about the rest energy first. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. So, for an electron, E_rest = m_e cÂ² = 0.511 MeV. The same for the positron because they have the same mass.

But since they're moving with Lorentz factors gamma_e =4 (electron) and gamma_p =2 (positron), their total energy would be gamma times E_rest.

So, the electron's energy is 4 * 0.511 = 2.044 MeV. The positron's energy is 2 * 0.511 = 1.022 MeV.

Wait, but wait, electrons and positrons have the same rest mass, so E_rest is same for both.

But when they collide and annihilate, their rest mass will contribute to the photons' energy. But since they're moving, their kinetic energy also contributes to the total energy.

Wait, but in annihilation, the total energy (rest plus kinetic) is converted into the photons' energies. So, the total energy
