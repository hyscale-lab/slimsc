Okay, so I've got this question here about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. There are four options: a, b, c, d. Each describes a planet with certain characteristics. I need to figure out the density for each and see which is the highest.

Let me start by recalling that density is mass divided by volume. So, the formula is density = mass/volume. But wait, volume for a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So, if two planets have the same radius, the one with more mass will have higher density. But if they have different radii, it's not just about mass.

Looking at the options:

Option a: Earth-mass and Earth-radius. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this planet should have that density.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density about 5.5. Wait, if the density is given, then that's straightforward. So this planet's density is already 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, wait, the planet's mass is 2 Earth masses. But if the density is also 5.5, which is Earth's, then maybe the radius is different. Because density is mass/volume, which is (mass)/( (4/3)πr³ ). If density is same as Earth, but mass is double, then the radius must be larger. Because mass is 2x, but density same implies volume is 2x. Volume scales with r³, so radius would be cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. So this planet has a higher radius than Earth, same density.

Option c: Same composition as Earth, but 5 times more massive. If the composition is same as Earth, then their densities should be the same, right? Because same materials mean same density. So Earth is about 5.5, so this planet should also be 5.5. But wait, wait: composition affects density. If it's same composition, their densities are same. So despite being 5x more massive, density remains same as Earth. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. Again, same composition implies same density. So this planet's density is 5
