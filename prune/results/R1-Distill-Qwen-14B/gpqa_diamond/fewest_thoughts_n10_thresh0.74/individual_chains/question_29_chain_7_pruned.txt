Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by producing mutants using EMS. They sequenced the target gene in mutants and found changes in the first exon.

Hmm, so the problem is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. I think that's related to disrupting the gene's function. So, probably a mutation that disrupts the gene's coding sequence.

Looking at the intact gene and the mutants:

The intact gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon) and has a long stretch of nucleotides. Each mutant has changes in the first part.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

Mutant 1:
Change is in the 4th position. Intact is TTCT, mutant has TTCT (wait, no, let me look again. Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Wait, so comparing each position. Let's break it down.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT …
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should line them up.

Looking at the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Wait, so the third codon in intact is CTC (codes for Leu), and in mutant1 it's CTA, which is also Leu. Then, the next codon: in intact, it's GCT (Ala), but in mutant1 it's CGT (Arg). So that's a change. But wait, that's in the coding sequence. So that would change an Ala to Arg. That's a missense mutation. But how does that affect the protein? It might change the amino acid, but not necessarily disrupt the gene.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC...

Wait, the third codon is CTA (Leu) again, like mutant1. Then, next codon in intact is GCT (Ala
