Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric because there are only dx and dy. Oh right, because a pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, probably embedded in some higher-dimensional space. But wait, in GR, metrics are usually for spacetime, but maybe this is a space-like slice or something else.

Wait, pseudosphere—I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But in terms of metric, how does that look? Oh wait, maybe this metric represents some kind of hyperbolic space. Alternatively, perhaps this is a metric in conformal form, since it's written as a function times (dx² + dy²). Conformal metrics are those where the metric is a scalar function times the flat metric, which is what I see here.

Wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So that means the metric becomes singular when 4 -x² -y² =0, i.e., when x² + y² =4. So the region where the metric is defined is where x² + y² <4, since otherwise the denominator becomes zero or negative. Wait, but the denominator can't be zero because that's where the metric blows up. So the domain would be the disk of radius 2 in the xy-plane. Because sqrt(x² + y²) < 2.

But wait, what's the area we're being asked about? The area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, so perhaps this metric is describing the geometry of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm.

Wait, pseudosphere in geometry usually refers to something like the tractricoid, which is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric for a pseudosphere in Poincaré coordinates maybe? Or maybe this is a metric in the plane that represents hyperbolic space.

Wait, the area of the pseudosphere—wait, I'm a bit confused. A pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, so its area would be finite if it's compact. But a standard pseudosphere isn't compact; it's infinitely long. Oh wait, maybe in this context, the metric is describing a compactified version or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the area of the two-dimensional space described by the metric. Wait, the metric is given as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So this is a two-dimensional metric; maybe it's a model of hyperbolic space. Because the standard hyperbolic plane in Poincaré disk coordinates has a metric like (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²), but maybe this is a different parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is for a space that's topologically a disk, but geometrically a sphere with some radius. Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So maybe the area can be calculated based on this metric.

Wait, another thought: the area of a two-dimensional space with metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²) is given by the double integral of g(x,y) dx dy. So in this case, the g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area A would be the integral over the entire domain where x² + y² <4 (since beyond that, the metric isn't defined) of 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

But wait, that integral would be over a disk of radius 2. Let me set up polar coordinates because it's symmetric. So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ. So the integral becomes the integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So the integral is 32 * ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫(r=0 to2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The integral over θ is 2π. So A = 32 * 2π * ∫(r=0 to2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute that integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

The integral ∫[r/(4 - r²)] dr becomes ∫ (1/u) * (-1/2) du from u=4 to 0. So flipping the limits, it's (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du. Which is (1/2) [ln u] from 0 to4. Wait, but ln 0 is negative infinity. Oh, so the integral diverges. That would mean the area is infinite.

Wait, but that can't be. Because the area of a pseudosphere is finite. Or is it? Wait, no—pseudosphere in the geometric sense is a surface with infinite area, I think. Because it's like a horn that goes on forever. Oh, right, the tractricoid has infinite area. So if the area of the metric is infinite, then perhaps that's the case here.

Wait, but the problem says "pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, but in the metric given, the denominator is 4 - x² - y², which is 4 at the origin, and goes to zero at radius 2. So perhaps the "radius" here refers to the curvature radius.

Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the Gaussian curvature is negative. The metric given seems to have a specific form. Let me recall that the Poincaré disk model has a metric where the curvature is -k, and the metric is (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). But in our case, the function is 32/(4 - r²), which is 32/(4 (1 - (r²/4 )) ) = 8/(1 - (r²/4 )).

Wait, compared to the Poincaré model, which is 4/(1 - r²)^2 when the curvature is -1. So perhaps the given metric is similar but scaled.

Wait, maybe the Gaussian curvature K can be found from the metric. For a metric in conformal form, K is given by - (1/(2g)) * Δ(ln g), where Δ is the Laplacian. Hmm, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, for a conformal metric g = e^{2f} (dx^2 + dy^2}, the curvature is related to the function f.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric. Let's see, the Gaussian curvature K for a metric g_{ij} in two dimensions is given by (1/(2√g)) ∂_i (√g (g^{ij} ∂_j f)), where f is the potential or something—wait, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, another approach: in isothermal coordinates, the metric is written as ds² = λ² (dx² + dy²), where λ is a scalar function. The Gaussian curvature K is then given by - (1/λ²) Δ λ, where Δ is the flat Laplacian. So let me compute λ here.

In our metric, the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So λ² = 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². Then λ = sqrt(32/(4 - r²)) = (4 sqrt(2)) / sqrt(4 - r²).

So compute Δ λ: Laplacian in polar coordinates is (1/r) d/dr (r dλ/dr).

Compute dλ/dr: let's see, λ = 4√2 (4 - r²)^{-1/2}.

dλ/dr = 4√2 * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^{-3/2} * (-2r) ) → simplifying, 4√2 * (r) (4 - r²)^{-3/2}.

So (1/r) d/dr [ r * dλ/dr ] → (1/r) d/dr [ r * 4√2 r (4 - r²)^{-3/2} ].

Wait, more carefully: first, compute the derivative inside.

Let me write dλ/dr = [4√2 * r ] / (4 - r²)^{3/2}.

Multiply by r: r * dλ/dr = 4√2 r² / (4 - r²)^{3/2}.

Now take derivative with respect to r: d/dr [4√2 r² (4 - r²)^{-3/2} ].

Let me factor out constants 4√2. So derivative of [r² (4 - r²)^{-3/2} ].

Using product rule: derivative of r² is 2r, times (4 - r²)^{-3/2}, plus r² times derivative of (4 - r²)^{-3/2}.

Derivative of (4 - r²)^{-3/2} is (-3/2)(4 - r²)^{-5/2} * (-2r) → 3 r (4 - r²)^{-5/2}.

So putting it all together:

2r (4 - r²)^{-3/2} + r² * 3 r (4 - r²)^{-5/2}.

Factor out (4 - r²)^{-5/2}:

(4 - r²)^{-5/2} [ 2r (4 - r²) + 3 r^3 ].

Expand: 2r (4 - r²) = 8r - 2r³. So inside the brackets: 8r - 2r³ +3 r^3 = 8r + r^3.

So the derivative is (4 - r²)^{-5/2} (8r + r^3).

Multiply by the constants and 4√2:

d/dr [r dλ/dr ] = 4√2 * (4 - r²)^{-5/2} (8r + r³).

Multiply by 1/(r) to get the Laplacian term (since Δλ = (1/r) d/dr [ r dλ/dr ] ).

So Δλ = (4√2 / r) * (8r + r^3) / (4 - r²)^{5/2}.

Simplify numerator: 8r + r³ = r(8 + r²).

So Δλ = 4√2 * r (8 + r²) / [r (4 - r²)^{5/2} } ] → 4√2 (8 + r²) / (4 - r²)^{5/2}.

Then, K = - (1/λ²) Δλ.

We have λ² = 32/(4 - r²) → 1/λ² = (4 - r²)/32.

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/32 ] * [4√2 (8 + r²) / (4 - r²)^{5/2} } ]

Simplify: (4 - r²) cancels one power from denominator, so denominator becomes (4 - r²)^{3/2}.

So K = - [ (1/32) ] * [4√2 (8 + r²) / (4 - r²)^{3/2} } ]

Multiply 1/32 and 4√2 → (4√2)/(32) = (√2)/8.

So K = - [ √2 (8 + r²) ] / [ 8 (4 - r²)^{3/2} } ]

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. I was expecting a constant curvature. But since K is varying with r², this isn't a constant curvature metric. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait. Maybe I should have considered that the metric is conformally flat, and in that case, there's a standard formula for curvature.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. If the metric's area is infinite, then the answer would be D) +infty.

In the earlier step, when I tried to compute the area by integrating the determinant of the metric, I found that the integral diverges. So the area is infinite, which would match option D.

Wait, but wait—the given metric is in two dimensions, so it's a surface. The area of a surface with this metric would be the volume of the space it represents. But if the integral over the domain is divergent, the area is infinite.

So, the pseudosphere in this context might have infinite area, meaning the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). To compute this, we calculate the area of the space described by the metric using the formula for the area in a conformal metric:

\[
A = \iint_D g(x, y) \, dx \, dy,
\]

where \( g(x, y) = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \) is the conformal factor, and \( D \) is the domain where the metric is defined. The metric becomes singular when \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \), i.e., when \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \). Thus, the domain \( D \) is the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.

Switching to polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), where \( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \), and \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, let \( u = 4 - r^2 \), so \( du = -2r \, dr \), or \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). When \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \), and when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_4^0 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) is \( \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln u\right]_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left(\ln 4 - \ln 0\right).
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \) diverges to \( -\infty \), the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere described by the metric is infinite. This matches the properties of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature and has infinite area.
