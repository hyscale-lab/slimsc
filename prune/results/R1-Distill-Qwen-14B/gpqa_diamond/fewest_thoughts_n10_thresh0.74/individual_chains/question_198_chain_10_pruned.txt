Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are 9, 40, 63, and 16 respectively. And the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species.

Wait, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it forms more readily. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)₃]^0, and β4 for [Co(SCN)₄]^2-? Or wait, maybe I should think about the charge. Co(II) is +2, and each SCN- is -1.

Let me think about the complexes:

- [Co(SCN)]^+ : Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+. So charge is +2 + (-1) = +1. So β1 is for the first complex.

- [Co(SCN)₂]^0: Co²+ + 2SCN^- → [Co(SCN)₂]^0. Charge would be +2 + 2*(-1) = 0. β2 is 40.

- [Co(SCN)3]^−: Co²+ +3SCN^- → [Co(SCN)3]^−. Charge is +2 -3 = -1. So β3 is 63.

- [Co(SCN)4]^2−: Co²+ +4SCN^- → [Co(SCN)4]^2−. Charge is +2-4= -2. β4 is 16.

Wait, but wait: stability constants are for each step. So the overall stability of the complexes increases with each step. But sometimes, some steps can have lower constants. Like in this case, β3 is higher than β2, but β4 is lower than β3. So the formation of the fourth complex isn't as favored as the third.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands. So the complex [Co(SCN)₂]^0, which is β2=40.

Wait, but wait—the problem says "blue dithiocyanato." I think that the [Co(SCN)₂]^0 is the blue one, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the [Co(SCN)6]^3- is a blood-red color, but I'm not certain about the dithiocyanato part. But the question specifies the blue one as the dithiocyanato complex, so I'll go with that.

So, we need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)₂]^0 among all Co species.

The approach here is to calculate the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants and concentrations.

The general approach is to model the formation of each complex step by step, considering the various possible complexes. But since the problem gives four stability constants, we have four possible complexes: from Co²+ with 1 to 4 SCN- ions.

The overall idea is to calculate the concentration of each complex and find the fraction that corresponds to the dithiocyanato ([Co(SCN)₂]^0) complex.

First, I should find the formation of each complex step by step. The formation of each complex depends on the concentration of SCN- and the stability constants.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, etc. So, I think the overall formation constants for each complex are:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN^-])

β2 = [Co(SCN)₂^0]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^2)

β3 = [Co(SCN)3^-
