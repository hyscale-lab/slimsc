Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out the value for the DNA sequence ACAGTGACC based on the given examples. Let's see. The examples provided are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA -> 176. I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what kind of algorithm is being used here. The output is a number, so maybe each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) is being converted into a specific value, and then summed up or something like that.

Let me look at the first example: AGG gives 115. So, the input is three nucleotides. Let's break that down. A, G, G. So that's three letters, output 115. Hmm, maybe each letter is assigned a numerical value, and they are added together.

Wait, but 115 is a bigger number than just adding single digits. So maybe each nucleotide is multiplied by a certain weight, or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are converted into their ASCII values and then manipulated.

Let me think about the ASCII values for the letters. A is 65, T is 84, C is 67, G is 71. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, in ASCII, uppercase letters start at A=65, B=66, etc. So, A is 65, G is 71, T is 84, C is 67.

Wait, let's check the first example. AGG is three letters: A, G, G. So their ASCII values are 65, 71, 71. If I add those up: 65 +71 +71 = 207. But the output is 115. That doesn't match. Hmm. So maybe it's not just a simple sum.

Alternatively, perhaps each nucleotide is converted into a number, like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4. Let me try that. For AGG: 1 +4 +4 =9. But the output is 115, way bigger. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a two-digit number. Like A=11, G=12, T=13, C=14? Then AGG would be 11 +12 +12 =35. Still not 115.

Alternatively, maybe each nucleotide is assigned a value that's a single digit, but perhaps each is a base-10 digit, so together they form a number. But AGG is 115. So 115 is a three-digit number. Let's see: A is 1, G is 1, G is 1? No, that would be 111. Not matching.

Wait another approach: Maybe each letter is converted into its position in the alphabet. A is 1, G is 7, T is 20, C is 3. So AGG would be 1 +7 +7 =15. Still not 115.

Hmm, maybe it's not about the letters themselves but something else. Let me think about the examples again:
