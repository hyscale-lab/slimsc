Okay, I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit this. Optical isomerism, right, that's when a compound has chiral centers, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. So, each compound that can have a chiral center would potentially show optical isomerism.

Let me look at the options one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, that's a mouthful. So, it's a biphenyl structure with two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', and the carboxylate esters are at 2 and 2'. Because the rings are connected by a single bond, they can rotate, but wait, wait. Oh, wait, the molecule has substituents that are on opposite sides. So, the question is whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it could have stereoisomerism. Alternatively, if the substituents cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry, then it won't exhibit isomerism.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2' which are across from each other on each ring, and 6 and 6' which are also across. Wait, but the positions might be such that the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think: 6 and 6' are the same, so each ring has a nitro group at position 6. Similarly, each ring has a carboxylate at 2. So, the molecule might have a center of symmetry. Wait, if each ring is substituted at 2 and 6, but the substituents are same on both rings, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Wait, but the positions 2 and 6 are meta to each other on each benzene ring. So, the arrangement might not create a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical across the central bond. Wait, so each ring mirrors the other. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making it a meso compound, which would mean no optical isomerism. Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a lack of symmetry. For biphenyls, if the groups on either ring are arranged such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it can have stereoisomerism.

Wait, but if it's 2,2' and 6,6', perhaps it's a para arrangement on each ring. So, each ring has two substituents at the para position, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two substituents on each ring but in such a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetric. Alternatively, maybe it's not possible for this structure to have optical isomerism because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. I'll come back to this one after looking at the others.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see, that's propanoate ester with a hydroxyl group on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3? Wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait no, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO- methyl ester. So, the structure is CH3-OOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, no, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The hydroxyl is on the second carbon, so it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. But as the ester, it's methyl ester, so CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. Wait, but wait, the structure would be: the central carbon has a hydroxyl group, a methyl group (from CH3), a carbonyl group (from COOCH3), and another CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me draw it:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3? No, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as the root. So, 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. Wait, but that's not possible because that would make the middle carbon CH2 with OH, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's HO-CH2-COOCH2CH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. So, the central carbon (carbon 2) has four groups: COOCH3, OH, CH3, and another CH3? Wait, no, because propanoate has three carbons: 1, 2, 3. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure:

CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- hydroxyl group (OH),

- methyl group (CH3),

- carbonyl group (COOCH3),

and another... Wait, wait, the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So, the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other. So, the substituents on the central carbon are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and another CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH3- C(OH) - COOCH3.

But that's only three substituents. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm making
