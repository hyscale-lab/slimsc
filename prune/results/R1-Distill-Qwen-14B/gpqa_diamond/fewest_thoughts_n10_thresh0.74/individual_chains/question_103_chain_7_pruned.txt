Okay, so I need to figure out how to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm. Let's think about the structure of the target molecule. It's a phenyl group with two substituents: a nitro group and a bromine. Also, the ethanone part is attached to the carbon where the nitro and bromine are. So the substituents should be in the meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl ring has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. And then the ketone (ethan-1-one) is attached to the same carbon as the phenyl group. So the structure is a phenyl ring with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), connected to a ketone.

I remember that when you substitute benzene, the directing effects of substituents matter. Nitro groups are meta directors, while bromine can be a meta or ortho/para director depending on the conditions. Also, the ethanone group is a ketone, which is a strong meta director.

So the plan is probably to nitrate and brominate the benzene in such a way that the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Wait, but since the ethanone comes from some alkylation, maybe we need to introduce that group first. Wait, no, because ethanone is a substituent attached to the benzene. So perhaps the ethanone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene itself is okay, but once you have deactivating groups like nitro, it won't undergo Friedel-Crafts anymore. So the order of substitution is crucial.

So the target substituents are nitro, bromine, and ketone (which is introduced via acylation). But wait, the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so after introducing it, can we add more groups? Probably not, because it's deactivating.

Wait, let me think again. The target has two substituents on the benzene: Br and NO2, and the ketone is part of the R group attached to the benzene. Oh wait no. The ethan-1-one is a group like (C=O)-CH2-, connected to the benzene. So the structure is benzene with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the ketone is attached at position 1 (the same carbon where the benzene is connected to the ketone group).

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the benzene ring as having substituents in specific positions. Let's number the benzene ring. Let's say the ketone is at position 1 (the point of attachment). Then, the bromine is at position 3 and the nitro is at position 5. So, the substituents are meta to each other relative to the ketone.

So, the plan is to introduce the substituents in such a way that they end up in the correct positions on the benzene ring.

But how? Because each substitution step affects where the next groups go.

So, the starting material is benzene. Let's outline the steps.

First, perhaps we introduce the nitro group. Nitration is a common first step. But nitro is a strong meta director.

Alternatively, if I first nitrate, then brominate, but the nitro would direct the bromine to meta positions.

Wait, but I also need to introduce the acetyl group (since ethanone is CH3CO-). So maybe the acylation is done first, but that requires activating the ring.

Wait, no, because Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group, and benzene is okay, but once you nitrate, which is a deactivating group, the ring is deactivated and Friedel-Crafts won't proceed.

Hmm. So perhaps the acylation comes after the nitration and bromination.
