Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question involves two reactions and analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I remember that HPLC can separate components based on their interaction with the stationary phase. Normal-phase HPLC uses a polar stationary phase, so the more polar compounds come out first. Chiral HPLC columns have a stationary phase that can separate enantiomers because they interact differently.

So, the problem states that Reaction I starts with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. I think LAH is used, which is a strong reducing agent. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone: hexan-3-one with a methoxy group at position 5. The structure would be something like (S) configuration at carbon 5, but wait, the position of the ketone is 3, so the molecule is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3... Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3, but the 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon from the end. Wait, hexan-3-one is six carbons, with ketone at position 3. So, numbering from the left: 1, 2, 3 (carbonyl), 4, 5, 6. So 5-methoxy would be on the 4th carbon? Wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Let's see: Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbons are: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (CO), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). Oh wait, no, hexan-3-one is more like CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the substituents would be at position 5 from which end? Wait, maybe the way to think about the structure is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

For hexan-3-one, position 3 is the carbonyl. So the structure is CH2-CH2
