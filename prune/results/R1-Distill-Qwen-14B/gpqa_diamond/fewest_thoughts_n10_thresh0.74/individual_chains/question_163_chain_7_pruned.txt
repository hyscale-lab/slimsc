Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid needed, and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each with a pH and a volume.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. First, I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 there is in moles, then see what reaction happens when it's dissolved in an acid. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, adding a strong acid should neutralize it. So the reaction would be between Fe(OH)3 and H+ ions.

Fe(OH)3 is a trihydroxide, right? So the formula is Fe(OH)3. Its molar mass must be calculated first. Let me think, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So each OH group is 17 g/mol. Wait, Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85) + 3*(O + H) which is 3*(17) = 51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles, which is about 9.36e-4 moles.

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid like HCl (monobasic) would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. That's 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

Now, the acid solution is 0.1 M HCl. Molarity is moles per liter, so 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter, which is 0.1 moles per 1000 cm³ or 0.0001 moles per cm³.

Wait, no, wait: 1 M is 1 mole per liter. So 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter, which is 0.1 moles per 1000 cm³. So per cm³, it's 0.1 / 1000 = 0.0001 moles per cm³.

We have to find the volume (V) in cm³ that provides 0.002808 moles. Because the acid is 0.1 M, the equation is:

Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters)
So, Volume (in liters) = Moles / Molarity.

But wait, volume is in cm³, so I have to convert liters to cm³. 1 liter is 1000 cm³.

So Volume = (0.002808 moles) / (0.1 moles per liter) ) → 0.02808 liters. Convert to cm³: 0.02808 * 1000 = 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but wait. The problem says 100 cm³ is the total volume. So when I add the acid, the total volume might change. Hmm, but wait, in solution, when you mix, the volumes add up. But wait, the question is about the minimum volume to dissolve 0.1g Fe(OH)3, but the solution's total volume is 100 cm³. So the acid volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution equals 100 cm³? No, wait, the initial solution is 100 cm³, and we're adding the acid to it. So the total volume after adding will be 100 + V, but wait, no—wait, the problem says 100 cm³ is the total volume. Oh, wait, no. Let me read the question again.

The question says: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm3 total volume." Oh
