Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. Hmm, I remember that quasars emit a lot of energy across various wavelengths. The question mentions a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, but why is that important?

Oh right, I think when you look at the spectrum of an object, especially something like a quasar, you can see emission lines. If there's a peak at about 790 nm, maybe that's because of some emission line like the Lyman-alpha or something else. Oh, wait, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But maybe there's a redshift involved here.

Right, quasars are very distant, so their light gets redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. So if a certain emission line is observed at a longer wavelength than it's emitted, that tells us about the redshift. So the original emission line at, say, 500 nm (visible light) is now observed at 790 nm. Let's think: the observed wavelength is lambda_obs = lambda_em * (1 + z), where z is the redshift.

So lambda_obs is 790 nm, lambda_em is what? Well, maybe it's a near-infrared emission line. Wait, near-infrared is about 700-2500 nm. The peak is at 790, so perhaps it's a rest frame optical line that's now in the near-infrared due to redshift.

Wait, another approach. The flux drops below 790 nm. So maybe the peak is at 790, and the flux drops towards shorter wavelengths. That suggests that the shorter wavelengths are less, which could be due to intervening absorption. Like the Lyman limit or something else. Oh, wait, the Lyman series is in the ultraviolet, so if the observed wavelength is longer than that, perhaps the light is getting absorbed beyond a certain point.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Suppose the quasar emits a strong emission line, say at 500 nm in its rest frame. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, then z = (790/500) - 1 = 1.58. So z is around 1.58. Alternatively, if the emission line is in the near-infrared, say 700 nm in rest frame, observed at 790, then z would be (790/700)-1 = 0.27, which is a lower redshift.

Wait, but quasars are typically high redshift objects. So high z, like z>1 or more. So maybe the 790 nm peak is the rest frame UV emission line that's been redshifted into the near-infrared. For example, the Lyman-alpha emission line is at about 121 nm in rest frame. If observed at 790 nm, that would mean z = (790 / 121) - 1 â‰ˆ (6.5289) -1 = 5.5289,
