Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. Hmm, let me try to figure out what's going on.

The setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, and G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and then also double mutants. The resistance levels of these mutants are given compared to the wild type. The question is about figuring out the interactions among these genes, especially since one of them is a transcription factor upstream of others.

Wait, transcription factors usually activate or repress other genes. So if a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes might not be expressed, leading to a loss of function.

Looking at the data:

- Wild type is 100% resistance, so the control is full resistance.
- g1: 75% → So it's less resistant than wild type but not as bad as g2 or g3.
- g2: 0% → This is a complete loss of resistance. So g2's function is critical.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance, so it's partially affected.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → Very low resistance.
  - g2g3: 0% → Also no resistance.
  - g1g2: 0% → No resistance.

Wait, but what do these results tell us about epistasis and transcription factors?

Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B depends on A.

Transcription factors usually are upstream, so their knock-out would affect the expression of downstream genes. So the downstream genes' functions are dependent on the transcription factor.

Looking at the mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. So in the absence of G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. Because knocking it out completely abolishes resistance.

What about the double mutants? Let's see:

g1g3 has 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But g1 alone has 75%, which is better than g1g3. Hmm. So when both G1 and G3 are out, the resistance is worse than each alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway, perhaps redundant in function.

Wait, but the double mutant g1g3 is worse than either of the single mutants. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because if they were redundant, you'd expect the double mutant to be as bad as the worst single mutant. But here, it's worse than both, which doesn't fit redundancy. Alternatively, maybe they are additive. Or perhaps one is upstream of the other.

Wait, let's think about epistasis. If G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it's upstream of both G1 and G3, or perhaps one of them.

Wait, looking at the double mutants involving G2:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, resistance is gone. So what's the effect of G2 on G1? Or maybe G2 is upstream of G1. Let me think: if G2 is a transcription factor activating G1, then in the g2 mutant, G1 isn't expressed. So in the g2 mutant, G1's product isn't there. So in the g1g2 mutant, both G1 and G2 are knocked out. But how does that affect resistance?

Wait, but in the single g2 mutant, the resistance is 0. So G2 is essential for resistance, perhaps because it's a transcription factor for other genes. So in the g1g2 mutant, which is already 0, adding the g1 knockout doesn't change anything. So that suggests that G2 is upstream of G1, perhaps.

Similarly, g2g3 has 0% resistance. So same thing, as the g2 knockout already can't resist. So in g2g3, knocking out G3 doesn't make it worse, because G2 is already knocked out.

Hmm, another angle: Let's look at how the resistance changes when combining knockouts.

The single mutants:

g2 has 0% (completely susceptible), so G2 is critical. G1 and G3 are less severe.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single. So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and each contributes to it, their combined knockout would have a more severe effect. But if they were redundant, the double mutant would be no worse than the more severe single. Since 10% is worse than both 75% and 50%, maybe they're in parallel pathways. Or perhaps they're in the same pathway but have additive effects.

But the key point is that G2 is a transcription factor. From the options, the conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But the data suggests G2 is the transcription factor, as its single knockout is 0% resistance. So option A says G1 is TF, which might not fit.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 epistatic over G1. Hmm, same promoter suggests they are co-regulated, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, gene redundancy would mean they have similar functions.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean that each can compensate for the other. So in the double mutant, you'd expect a more severe phenotype than either single. But in this case, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. So that's consistent with redundancy.

But wait, if they are redundant, the double mutant would be as bad as the more severe single. Because each gene can compensate for the other. But in our case, both are not that bad when single.

Wait, let me think. If both G1 and G3 are in the same pathway and function redundantly, each providing some level of resistance. For example, G1 contributes 75%, G3 contributes 50% in single mutants.

If they're redundant, then each provides 50% of the function. So in a single mutant, you lose 50% of the function, leading to 50% resistance. But wait, that's not exactly what's happening here.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's think of the resistance as being based on the production of some factor, say, a chemical that inhibits the fungus. Let's say the total required level is R.

If G
