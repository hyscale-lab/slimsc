Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, okay. I remember that Lyman alpha emission is a specific transition in hydrogen, usually in the ultraviolet range. Since the wavelength given is 1216 Angstroms, that's 121.6 nanometers, which is in the far-ultraviolet. But ground-based telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere blocks most UV light. So how does this relate to redshift?

Right, when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But if the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion of the universe), the wavelength gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

The point is, we want this redshifted wavelength to be in the optical range because ground telescopes can't see UV. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nm or so. So we need to find the redshift where the Lyman-alpha line moves into the optical.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The quasar's Lyman alpha is emitted at 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm, UV). When it's absorbed by a cloud at redshift z, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_emit * (1 + z). So λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z) Angstroms.

We want λ_obs to be in the optical range, say around 400 nm and up. Because if it's longer than that, we can detect it with ground-based telescopes. If it's shorter, like UV, we can't.

Wait, but wait again. It's a bit tricky. The quasar's light is at 1216, but after being absorbed, the Lyman-alpha line would be at a longer wavelength. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the redshift must be enough to shift it into that range.

Let me compute when 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) redshifts into 400 nm.

Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So, 1216 * (1+z) = 4000 Angstroms.

So (1+z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.29.

So z ≈ 2.29.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.29. The options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9.

So the closest
