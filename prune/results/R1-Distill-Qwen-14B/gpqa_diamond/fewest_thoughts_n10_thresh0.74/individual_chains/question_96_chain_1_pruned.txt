Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with black hole thermodynamics. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given data is the angular size of its event horizon, which is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs.

Hmm, I remember that entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. That formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find A first.

Wait, the angular size θ is given. The event horizon's diameter would be related to this angle. Oh right, θ is the angular diameter. So the formula for angular diameter is θ ≈ (diameter) / distance. But wait, θ is in degrees, and I'll need to convert that to radians because in physics equations, angles are often in radians.

Let me think: 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 10^-17 degrees * (π/180). Let me compute that. 10^-17 * π ≈ 3.14e-17. Divided by 180, so approximately 1.75e-19 radians.

So the diameter D is approximately θ (in radians) multiplied by the distance d. But wait, what are the units here? The distance d is given in parsecs, and I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So D = θ * d = (1.75e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) ≈ 5.39e7 meters. Wait, that's about 5.4e7 meters. So the radius is half of that, R = 2.7e7 meters.

Wait, but wait. The angular size is the diameter, so D = θ * d (in radians). So yeah, that
