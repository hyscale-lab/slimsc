Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me take it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions leading to a product, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. 

Starting with the first part, the initial compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So the starting material is a norbornene derivative with a bulky substituent.

Next, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is often a good nucleophile, but in this case, with dibromomethyl groups, I'm thinking about elimination or substitution. Wait, when dibromomethyl groups are present, especially with NaI, maybe it's an SN2 reaction? Or perhaps elimination since there are two leaving groups (Br) attached to adjacent carbons.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6. So each of those is CH2Br2. When NaI is present, perhaps the Br leaves, and I- comes in. But with two equivalents, maybe each substituent on the cyclohexadiene is getting dehalogenated. Alternatively, perhaps this is a diels-alder reaction setup? Wait, no, because the initial compound is a diene, and the other is dienophile-like. Or maybe it's a ring-opening or some coupling.

Wait, another possibility: The norbornene has a double bond, and the other compound is a dienophile. So perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction is happening. The starting material is a bicyclic diene, and the other has two dibromomethyl groups. Wait, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile, but the dienophile typically has a triple bond or a strained double bond. Hmm. Alternatively, the norbornene could be the dienophile, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a [2+4] cycloaddition, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the reagents. Sodium iodide as a catalyst or maybe as a base? Wait, when you have two equivalents, maybe two moles of the dienophile are reacting with the diene. Or perhaps it's a ring-opening metathesis? I'm not too confident about this step.

Wait, another approach: the initial structure is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So that's norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. Then, reacting it with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. I think the NaI is probably a catalyst or a source of iodide ions. With two equivalents, perhaps each of the two Br groups is replaced by something else.

Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups. So each of those is Br2C-CH2-. When NaI is present, perhaps the Br is replaced by I, but in this case, since it's a substitution, perhaps it's an SN2 reaction. But with two equivalents, maybe each of the two dibromomethyl groups undergoes substitution. So each CH2Br2 becomes CH2I2? Or perhaps each Br is replaced by an iodide, but with two equivalents, maybe we're getting two substitutions per molecule. Wait, no, that wouldn't make sense because each dibromomethyl has two bromines.

Wait a minute, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups loses both bromines. So in the presence of NaI and heat, maybe
