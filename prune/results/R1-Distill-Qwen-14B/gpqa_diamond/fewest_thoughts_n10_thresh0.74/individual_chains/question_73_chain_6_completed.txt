Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relativistic speeds and energy. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, you can't just add them normally because of relativity. Oh right, the classic example is the train and the person walking inside, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction. The options are about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, for the relative speed, I think the formula is different. When two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference. I remember the formula from special relativity—something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, wait. Let me think. Oh, no, wait, that's when you're finding the speed of one object from the frame of another. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that.

Wait, wait, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of the first object in the original frame, and v is the speed of the second. So in this case, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c because they are both in the same direction. So substituting, the numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. That would match options C and D.

Now, the total energy. The total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, the question is about the total energy of the system. So perhaps it's the sum of the energies of both astronauts.

Each person's total energy is gamma times their rest mass energy. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the first astronaut, mass 2m and speed 0.6c. Gamma1 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is gamma1 * m_rest * c². Wait, the rest mass energy is m*c², but here the masses are 2m and 3m. So E1 for astronaut 1 is 2m * gamma1 c² = 2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut 2, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 is 3m * gamma2 c² = 3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and option D has E=5 mc². So C would be the match.

Wait, double-check the energy calculation. Let me compute 3m * gamma2 c² again. Gamma for 0.5c is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) which is approximately 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 c² = 3 * 1.1547=3.4641, so E2 is 3.4641 m c². E1 is 2.5 m c². Total is 5.9641 m c². So option C says E=5.96 mc², which matches. The relative speed is 0.14c, which is option C.

So the correct answer would be option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is calculated using the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Conclusion
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is approximately \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:
