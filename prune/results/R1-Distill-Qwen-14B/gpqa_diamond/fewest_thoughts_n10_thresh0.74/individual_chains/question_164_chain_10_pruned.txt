Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see. The question is about binary star systems and determining which one is more massive by a certain factor. I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, so their motion is influenced by each other's gravity.

The problem gives two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, so that's the orbital period of the binary system. So system_1 has a longer period than system_2. But how does that relate to their masses?

The spectroscopic observations give radial velocity amplitudes. System_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10. Radial velocity amplitude is the maximum speed at which the stars move toward or away from us in their orbit. So each star's velocity is related to the mass of the other star.

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit, meaning it's moving slower, and the less massive star moves faster. So the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses of the stars. Because the center of mass is the balance point.

Wait, the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = (2Ï€G / P)^1/3 * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), but I'm probably mixing up some terms. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function.

Alternatively, I think that the ratio of the velocities of the two stars is equal to the inverse ratio of their masses. So, for system_1, star A has velocity 10 km/s, and star B has 5 km/s. So the mass ratio M_A / M_B = velocity_B / velocity_A. So M_A / M_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So M_A is half of M_B. So their masses are in a 1:2 ratio.

Wait, no, wait. Because the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to their mass. So if M1 is the mass of star 1, M2 is the mass of star 2, then M1/M2 = v2/v1. So if in system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5, then M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 * M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the way the question is worded, system_1 has two stars whose velocities are 10 and 5. So for system_1, M1 is the mass of the star with velocity 10, and M2 is the mass of the star with velocity 5. So M1 = (v2) / (v1 + v2) * (M_total). Hmm, maybe I should think about the mass function.

Wait, another approach. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K for each star is given by K = (v1) and K2 = (v2). The ratio of velocities is v1/v2 = K1/K2. But since the center of mass requires M1 v1 = M2 v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. That's the key equation.

In system_1, v1 = 10, v2 =5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

But wait, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 1
