Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read the question again and see what I can figure out.

The question says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, this mixture undergoes disproportionation to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenating both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, and Z is a solvent widely used. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated. Importantly, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of X.

Hmm. So I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me start by trying to figure out what Z is. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 14.28% is approximately 1/7, because 1/7 is about 14.29%. So the molecular weight of Z must be such that the hydrogen contributes 1/7 of it.

Assuming Z is a hydrocarbon, let's say its formula is CnH2m. Wait, but since Z is a product of hydrogenation and doesn't react further with hydrogen, it must be fully saturated, so it's an alkane. Alkanes have the formula CnH2n+2. So maybe Z is an alkane.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the hydrogen percentage. Z has mass fraction H as 14.28%. So, (mass of H)/(molecular weight of Z) = 0.1428.

Let me denote molecular weight as M. The molecular weight of H is 1, and the molecular formula is CnH2k. Wait, no, for alkanes, it's CnH2n+2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the molecular formula for Z. So, let's let Z be CxHy.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is (y * 1) / (12x + y) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

So,

y / (12x + y) = 0.1428

Let's rewrite that:

y = 0.1428 * (12x + y )

Multiply both sides by 1:

y = (0.1428)(12x) + 0.1428 y

Bring the 0.1428 y to the left:

y - 0.1428 y = 0.1428 *12x

0.8572 y = 1.7136 x

Hmm, 0.8572 is approximately 6/7 because 6/7 is about 0.8571. So, 6/7 y ≈ 1.7136 x.

Multiply both sides by 7:

6y ≈
