Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, so this is in polar coordinates, right? Because r and θ are polar coordinates. So the potential depends on r and θ. 

I remember that in two dimensions, when you have a potential like r² terms, especially when it's separable into r and θ parts, you can probably separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. Oh wait, but this potential has r² terms multiplied by cos²θ. So it's not just purely r-dependent. Hmm, that complicates things a bit.

Let me try to rewrite the potential to see if I can separate it. V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out the r²: V(r,θ) = r² [ (1/2)k + (3/2)k cos²θ ].

Wait, maybe I can think about this as a sum of two terms. One depends only on r, the other depends on both r and θ. Hmm, but actually, the angular part is cos²θ. I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using double-angle identities. Oh right! cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² * (1 + cos(2θ))/2.

Let me compute that. The second term would be (3/4)k r² [1 + cos(2θ)]. So the entire potential V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ).

Wait, so combining the constants, (1/2 + 3/4) is (5/4)k r². So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos(2θ). 

Hmm, that
