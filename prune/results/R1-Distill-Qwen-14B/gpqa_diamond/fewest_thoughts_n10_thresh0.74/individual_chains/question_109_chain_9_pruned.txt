Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emissions. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Then there's this Pauli statistics condition given: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, what's that about? Oh right, Pauli's exclusion principle applies when identical fermions are involved. But wait, in this case, the nucleons are the ones emitting a particle, so maybe the NN system is being considered as a composite particle here. Or perhaps the total isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum have to satisfy that equation.

The final NN state has T(NN)=0. So I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on conservation laws.

The options are four different transitions, each involving the emission of a particle denoted by a lowercase letter. Let's list them:

A) 1S0 -> 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 -> 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 -> 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 -> 3P0 + s

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So that's the 1S0 state before emission. After emission, the state becomes something else plus a particle X.

The term symbol is written as (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0 would be (2*0 +1)S0 = 1S0. So S=0, L=0, J=0? Because 1S0 is the ground state.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the final state is another state, let's say |f>, and X. So we have to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Also, the Pauli condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Since T=0, this implies 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. One even, the other odd.

Wait, so for the
