Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically dealing with a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... that's one of the seven crystal systems, right? I remember it's also called the trigonal crystal system because all the axes are equal, but the angles can vary. Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait. Wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are the same length, a, but the angles can all be the same, which is the case here. So this is a special case where alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. That's a bit unusual because typically in a rhombohedral system, the angles could be different, but here they're all the same.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. The formula I remember for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by (a/(sqrt(1 + 2cosα (cos²h + cos²k + cos²l) - ... )) Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ is more complex. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, right? So maybe that simplifies the formula.

Wait, for a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but this is a rhombohedral system, so it's not cubic, but we can use a similar approach but with consideration of the angles. Oh right, the formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is (a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cosγ + hl cosβ + kl cosα) )) ). Wait, is that accurate? Or is there a different formula because all the angles are the same here.

Wait, let me think. In a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, so the lattice is determined by three vectors of equal length a, with angles between them all equal to some gamma (since alpha = beta = gamma here). So the formula for d_{hkl} would involve the structure factor and the angles.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the reciprocal lattice. The interplanar distance is given by 1/d
