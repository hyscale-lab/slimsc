Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

Cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. The basic idea is that the particles move in a circular path due to the magnetic field, and each time they complete a half-circle, an electric field gives them a push. But wait, in a cyclotron, the magnetic field is kept constant, and the electric field is applied across the gaps between the D-shaped electrodes. The frequency of the electric field has to match the circular motion of the particles as they spiral out.

Wait, but synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron. Oh right, they are designed to handle relativistic particles, where the mass increases as the speed approaches the speed of light. So unlike the classical cyclotron, the synchrocyclotron's magnetic field isn't constant; it actually increases as the particle's momentum increases. That makes sense because when the particle's speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, the classical cyclotron's approach wouldn't work since the required frequency would change.

But in this problem, the setup is a bit different. The proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, T ≈ 0, which I think means it starts from rest. Then it undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy of 950 MeV. Hmm, wait, two accelerations? Or maybe it's accelerated twice around the ring? Not sure yet.

The question is about how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The applied voltage is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], where U0 is 190 kV, and Φ0 is π/4.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The equation for U(t) has ν(α), which probably depends on the angle α. But I think in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is kept in a specific relation to the particle's motion. Let me think about the resonance condition.

In a cyclotron, the particles move in a circular path, and their angular frequency is given by ω = qB/m. The electric field's frequency must match this for each revolution. But in
