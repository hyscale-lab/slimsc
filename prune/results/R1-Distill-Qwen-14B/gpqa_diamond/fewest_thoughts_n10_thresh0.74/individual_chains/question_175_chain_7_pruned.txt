Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength, lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f that depends on lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution and the angle theta. For something with spherical symmetry but oscillating along the z-axis, like a dipole, the radiation pattern is directional.

Wait, for a dipole radiator, the radiation is more intense along the equatorial plane (theta = 90 degrees) than along the axis (theta = 0 or 180). The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by sin^2(theta). So the power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta) multiplied by some function of wavelength, I think.

But wait, the question is about the fraction of the maximum power. The maximum power would occur where the function f is maximum. Since the function f is a function of theta and lambda, maybe the maximum occurs when sin^2(theta) is maximum, which is when theta is 90 degrees, making sin(theta) = 1.

Wait, but in the problem, the maximum power A is given. So, the function f probably has a term that depends on the direction, like sin^2(theta), and another term that depends on lambda, maybe like 1/lambda^4 or something. Because in radiation, the power often depends on higher powers of frequency or inversely on wavelength.

So the general form of the power could be something like f(theta, lambda) = (some constant) * (sin^2(theta)) / (lambda^4), since I remember that the radiated power for dipole radiation has an inverse square of the frequency, which is inverse lambda, so perhaps inverse fourth power because of other factors.

Wait, the formula
