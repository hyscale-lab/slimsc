Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question here about optical activity. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through each compound step by step.

The question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. Optical activity means the compound has chiral centers, right? Because a chiral center is necessary for a compound to rotate plane-polarized light. So I need to check each compound for the presence of chiral centers. Wait, but wait—is that the only possibility? I remember that sometimes molecules can be chiral without having a stereocenter. Like if they have a plane of symmetry or something. Hmm, but in this question, I think looking for stereocenters is the main approach.

Let's look at each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Structure: The molecule is CH₂Cl-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃ with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, no, but wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on each carbon are:

On C1: Cl, one double bond (so no H there), and two CH2-CH3 groups?

Wait, maybe I should draw it. Let me think: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl
