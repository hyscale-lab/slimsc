Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they'll undergo a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce acetate ions and water.

First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Because when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 is (M1 * V1) / V2. Let me plug in the numbers: M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = (1) /40 = 0.0125 M. Oh wait, no, 0.05 *20 is 1, then divided by 40 is 0.025 M. Oh right, because 20/40 is 0.5, so 0.05 * 0.5 is 0.025. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating, the volume of NaOH added will determine how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized. The problem asks for the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

So, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, let's get the moles first. Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M × 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) = 0.001 mol. Oh wait, 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001 moles.

So the equivalence point requires adding 0.001 moles of NaOH. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume V is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, we'll have added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, the problem asks for the pH at 25% titration. 25% of what? I think it's the volume of NaOH added being 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. Since the equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% of that would be 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, wait a second. Another way to think about it: 25% titration could be when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So let me see. The initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. 25% of that is 0.00025 mol. So moles of
