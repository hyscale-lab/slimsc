Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Or wait, no, I think it's exp(-E/(kT)), but since β is 1/(kT), it's exp(-βE). So each state contributes exp(-βE) to Z.

Each spin has two possible states, so the system has 2^3 = 8 possible states. I'll need to evaluate the energy E for each of these 8 states and then sum exp(-βE) for all of them.

But wait, instead of enumerating all 8 states, maybe there's a smarter way. The energy expression is symmetric in all three pairs. So perhaps I can find the number of states that have a particular value of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think about the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Because S_i and S_j are each ±1, their product is also ±1.

Wait, no, wait, actually S_i S_j can be +1 (if they're the same) or -1 (if different). So the sum is the sum of three terms each ±1.

What are the possible values of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3?

Let me find all possible combinations. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the number of terms that are +1 and -1.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to note that S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - (S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2) ) / 2.

Wait, let's see: Let me compute (S1 + S2 + S3)^2. That equals S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S_i^2 is 1 (since S_i is ±1), so S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 = 3.

So (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). 

Rearranging, S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.

Hmm, that might help. Let me let M = (S1 + S2 + S3). Then M can take on values -3, -1, +1, +3. Because each S_i is ±1, their sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (+1, +1, -1), etc.

So then, the sum S1S2 + ... is [ M^2 -3 ] / 2.

So M can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Let me compute the sum for each M:

For M=3: sum = (9-3)/2 = 6/2 = 3.

For M=1: sum = (1-3)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.

For M=-1: same as M=1, sum is -1.

For M=-3: sum is (9-3)/2 =3, same as M=3.

So the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 are 3 and -1. Now I need to find how many states have each of these sums.

Let me think about how many states correspond to each value.

Case 1: Sum is 3. So M^2 = 3^2=9 → M=3 or M=-3.

When M=3, all three spins are +1. Only one state: +1, +1, +1.

When M=-3, all spins are -1. Only one state: -1, -1, -1.

So sum=3 occurs in 2 states.

Case 2: Sum is -1. Then M^2 =1 → M=1 or M=-1.

When M=1, sum of spins is 1. How many states have M=1?

To find that, how many ways can three spins sum to 1. Each spin is ±1.

Possible scenarios: two spins +1, one spin -1. The number of such states is C(3,2) =3.

Similarly, when M=-1, the sum is -1. That occurs when two spins are -1 and one is +1. Also 3 states.

So total states where sum is -1: 3+3=6.

So sum=3 occurs in 2 states, sum=-1 occurs in 6 states.

So each state contributes exp[-β E]. But E is -J times the sum. So E = -J*(sum).

So E = -J * (3 or -1).

So for sum=3, E = -J *3 → E = -3J.

For sum=-1, E= -J*(-1) = J.

So now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Because the states are grouped by their E, I can compute it as:

Number of states * exp(-β * E) for each group.

So for sum=3: 2 states, each with E=-3J. So each contributes exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ).

So 2 * exp(3Jβ).

For sum=-1: 6 states, each with E= J. So each contributes exp(-β*(J)) = exp(-Jβ).

So 6 * exp(-Jβ).

Thus, Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ). So that would be correct?

Wait, let me check the options:

Option A) 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}

Option B) 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}

Yes, that matches what I have. So the correct answer should be B.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), we start with the energy expression \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
\]

where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Since there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states, we can group them based on the value of \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \), which determines \( E \).

### Step 1: Possible values of \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \)
Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). The sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can therefore take the values \( 3 \) or \( -1 \), depending on the configuration of the spins.

- **Case 1: \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \):**  
  This occurs when all three spins are aligned (either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \)). There are \( 2 \) such states.

- **Case 2: \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \):**  
  This occurs when two spins are aligned and one is opposite. There are \( 6 \) such states.

### Step 2: Energy for each case
The energy \( E \) is given by \( E = -J[S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3] \). Substituting the possible values of \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \):

- For \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = 3 \):  
  \[
  E = -J(3) = -3J.
  \]

- For \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \):  
  \[
  E = -J(-1) = J.
  \]

### Step 3: Partition function
The partition function is the sum of contributions from all states, weighted by \( e^{-\beta E} \). Grouping contributions by energy:

- For \( E = -3J \): There are \( 2 \) states, each contributing \( e^{-\beta(-3J)} = e^{3J\beta} \). Total contribution: \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).

- For \( E = J \): There are \( 6 \) states, each contributing \( e^{-\beta(J)} = e^{-J\beta} \). Total contribution: \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

Thus, the partition function is:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Final Answer:
Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**B) \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \).**
