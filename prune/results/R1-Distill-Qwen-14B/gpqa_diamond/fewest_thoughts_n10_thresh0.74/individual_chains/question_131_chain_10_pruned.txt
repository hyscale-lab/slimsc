Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to figure it out.

Alright, the question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. So, a dicarboxylic acid has two carboxylic acid groups. The fact that it has a cis-alkene suggests that there's a double bond between two carbons, and the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side. When they dehydrate this acid, they form an anhydride. Dehydration typically removes water, so joining two carbonyl groups perhaps?

The anhydride then has a single peak at 7 ppm in its 1H NMR. Wait, 7 ppm is a region where protons are probably deshielded. Aromatic protons are around there, but maybe it's something else. But the anhydride... Hmm. Also, the 13C NMR shows two peaks: one at 137 ppm and another at 165 ppm. So in 13C NMR, carbonyl carbons are usually around 170-220 ppm. The 137 ppm is more like a spÂ² carbon, maybe a carbonyl adjacent to something else.

Wait, what's an anhydride's structure? An anhydride is formed by losing a water molecule from a dicarboxylic acid, so you have two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen bridge. So the structure would be something like O=C-O-C=O, but with the connectivity depending on where the dehydration occurred.

The single peak in the 1H NMR... Hmm. For an anhydride, the oxygen bridge's protons might be split or something. Wait, no, wait. Anhydrides like maleic anhydride have protons on the oxygen bridge, but they usually show up as a singlet because of symmetry. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the structure is cyclic, and the protons are equivalent, so they give a singlet. The chemical shift for those is around 2 ppm, I think. Oh wait, but the problem says 7 ppm, which is higher. Maybe the protons are not on the oxygen bridge then. Or perhaps the substituents around the anhydride cause the shift.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is from a substituted dicarboxylic acid. Since the starting acid had a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form a bicyclic anhydride? Or perhaps a more substituted one. Let me think about the NMR. The 1H NMR has a single peak. So all the protons in that region are equivalent. Maybe it's a methyl group or something else.

Wait, the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR. That suggests that all the protons in that environment are equivalent. So perhaps a group that's symmetric. Like if the anhydride is symmetric, like succinic anhydride, but that's more of a die
