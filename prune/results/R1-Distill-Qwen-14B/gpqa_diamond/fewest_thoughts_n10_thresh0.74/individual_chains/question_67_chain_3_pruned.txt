Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about two electrons in a p orbital angular momentum state. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. L is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is its z-component.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum, the quantum numbers determine the possible states. Each electron has l=1, which is a p orbital. So each has m values of -1, 0, +1 for the z-component.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. Coupled states refer to when you combine two angular momenta. I think when you couple l₁ and l₂, you get possible total L values from |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂. Since both are 1, L can be 0, 1, or 2. But in this case, the state is given as L=2 and m=-1.

Wait, but to find the probability of both L₁z and L₂z being -ħ, I think I need to express the coupled state in terms of the product states of the individual electrons' states. Because the product states would have definite l₁z and l₂z values.

So, each electron's state can be represented as |l₁, m₁> and |l₂, m₂>. The coupled state is a combination of these product states. The total state |1,1,2,-1> must be expressed as a linear combination of |m₁, m₂> where m₁ + m₂ = m_total, which is -1 in this case.

Wait, but the coupled state |l₁, l₂, L, M> is built from the product states |l₁, m₁>|l₂, m₂>. For each combination of m₁ and m₂ where m₁ + m₂ = M (which is -1 here), there's a coefficient in the expansion.

So for the state |1,1,2,-1>, I need to find all possible pairs (m₁, m₂) such that m₁ + m₂ = -1. Each m can be -1, 0, +1. So possible pairs are:

(-1, 0), because -1 +0 =-1.

(0, -1), since 0 + (-1) =-1.

But wait, the total L is 2. I think when you couple l₁=1 and l₂=1, the maximum L is 2. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is part of that.

But how is this state expressed in terms of the product states?

I remember that for two angular momenta coupling, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (
