Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that they're tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and giving them to mice orally. Then they're using in vivo imaging. I remember that when you give something orally, it usually goes through the digestive system first. The stomach has acid, which probably breaks down some proteins. The question says some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. So the proteins that aren't destroyed must have survived the stomach and moved further into the intestines.

Next, it mentions that some GFP was entangled in the intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs are like places where immune responses happen, like Peyer's patches. So Peyer's patches are in the intestinal wall and are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). So, the GFP-tagged proteins probably got to the Peyer's patches.

They isolated the proliferating cell population from these patches. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are likely lymphocytes, maybe B cells or T cells. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests some kind of diversification process.

Now, what processes are involved in diversifying the immune receptors? I remember a few key processes. There's VDJ recombination, which happens in B cells during their development in the bone marrow. VDJ stands for Variable, Diversity, Joining. This creates the initial diversity in the B cell receptors. But once they're mature, B cells can undergo other processes.

Somatic hypermutation comes into play during the germinal center reactions. This is when activated B cells undergo mutations in their variable regions, increasing diversity and affinity for antigens. Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), which is also part of the immune response.

Wait, the question is about the process happening when they observed high variability in the variable heavy chain. So, after the initial VDJ recombination, which is during B cell development, but if they're looking at variability after an immune response, it's likely somatic hypermutation.

So, when the GFP-tagged proteins (antigens) reach the Peyer's patches, they're likely activating B cells. These B cells would then go through the immune response steps, including activation, proliferation, and differentiation. In the germinal centers, they undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of their antibodies. That's why the sequencing showed high variability.

The other options: Complement activation is about opsonization and clearing pathogens, not directly about generating diversity in the variable regions. VDJ recombination is the initial setup, not the ongoing diversification. Class switching is about changing the isotype, which doesn't explain the variable chain diversity.

So the process must be somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The fluorescence from these proteins is partially destroyed by stomach acid and some are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs, specifically the Peyer patches. These patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are known to play a role in immune responses to enteric pathogens.

When the GFP-tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, they likely activate B cells, which are part of the immune response. The isolation of the proliferating cell population and the observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences suggest that the B cells are undergoing a process that diversifies their antigen receptors. 

Among the immune processes, VDJ recombination occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, this process is not relevant here, as the question focuses on variability observed after the immune response has been initiated. Complement activation is involved in pathogen clearance but does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain. Class switching recombination changes the antibody isotype but does not account for the diversification of the variable region.

The most plausible explanation is somatic hypermutation, which occurs during the germinal center reaction. This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing their diversity and affinity for specific antigens. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene sequences is consistent with this mechanism, as it is a key process in generating diverse and adaptive immune responses.
