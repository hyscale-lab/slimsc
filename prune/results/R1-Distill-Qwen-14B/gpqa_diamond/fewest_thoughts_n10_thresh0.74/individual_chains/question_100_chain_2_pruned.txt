Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step because I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it out.

Alright, the starting compound is Compound A, which is C3H6. I know that C3H6 can be either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. Wait, but propene has the formula C3H6 and cyclopropane is also C3H6. Hmm. But when you talk about bromination in CCl4, that usually refers to addition reactions, especially for alkenes. So maybe Compound A is an alkene, probably propene. Because cyclopropane is a ring, but I'm not sure how that would react. Alternatively, maybe it's another structure. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an alkyne? No, because an alkyne would have a different hydrogen count. Wait, no, wait: propyne is HCâ‰¡C-CH3, which has molecular formula C3H4, so that's not C3H6. So back to alkenes. So I'll assume Compound A is propene, CH2=CHCH3.

So, the first reaction is bromination in CCl4. Bromination of propene would likely be an addition reaction. Propene has a double bond, so when it reacts with bromine (Br2) in a halogenation reaction. The bromine would add across the double bond. Since the starting material is propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, but wait: propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would add across the double bond. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, which is 1,2-dibromopropane, so that's Compound B.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a base, and when it reacts with vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons), it can cause an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. So in this case, Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation. So two eliminations of HBr would occur, but wait, wait. Wait, that compound has two Br atoms on adjacent carb
