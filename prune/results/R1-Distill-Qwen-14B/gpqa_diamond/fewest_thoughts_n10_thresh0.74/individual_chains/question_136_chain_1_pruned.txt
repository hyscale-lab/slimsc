Alright, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me think about how to approach it. Okay, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R.

First, I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. Oh wait, right, the divergence theorem states that ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the unit normal vector to the surface. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the divergence directly and then integrate.

The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So f(r) is a radial vector field. Let's denote it as f(r) = F(r) r̂, where F(r) is 1/r².

I need to find ∇·f. Since f is purely radial, the divergence in spherical coordinates should simplify. The general formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)) for a radial field. So that's ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * F(r)).

Substituting F(r) = 1/r², let's compute that. So r² * F(r) = r² * (1/r²) = 1. Taking the derivative of 1 with respect to r gives zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, that implies the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe the origin?

But wait, isn't the divergence zero except at the origin? Because the field looks like the electric field of a point charge, which is divergence-free except at the charge where it's a delta function. Oh right! So for r ≠ 0, the divergence is zero. But when we integrate over the volume, if the sphere doesn't include the origin, the integral is zero. If it does include the origin, like a sphere of radius R=0, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the problem says the sphere is centered at the origin, but the field falls off as 1/r². So the field is defined except at the origin, which is a point of singularity.

So, when we integrate the divergence over any volume that doesn't include the origin, the integral is zero. But if the volume does include the origin, like in a sphere of any radius R>0, the divergence isn't defined there but contributes a delta function. Wait, no, the divergence is a
