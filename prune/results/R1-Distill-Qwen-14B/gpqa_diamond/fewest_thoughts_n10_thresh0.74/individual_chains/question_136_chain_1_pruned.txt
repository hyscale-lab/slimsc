Okay, so I've got this problem here about a vector field and calculating the volume integral of its divergence inside a sphere. Hmm, let's see what I remember from vector calculus.

The question says the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, the field is pointing outwards (or inwards, but the direction depends on the sign) and its magnitude is 1/r². That sounds familiar, like maybe it's an electric field or something similar.

Wait, the problem is asking for the volume integral of the divergence of f inside a sphere of radius R. I remember from Gauss's Law that the divergence of a vector field relates to the charge enclosed, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Oh wait, but maybe I can compute the divergence first.

So, how do you find the divergence of a radially symmetric vector field? Let me think. In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that only has a radial component is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component of the vector field. Because the other components (like theta and phi) are zero, their derivatives won't contribute.

So, the vector field f(r) is (f(r) ȓ), where f(r) = 1/r². So the radial component A_r is 1/r². Let's compute the divergence.

Div f = (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) 

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. That means the divergence is zero? Wait, but that can't be right. Because sometimes, for example, electric fields have div E proportional to rho, and for a point charge, the divergence would be non-zero at the origin.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in computing the derivative. Let me re-do that. 

Inside the divergence formula: r² multiplied by 1/r² is indeed 1. So d/dr (1) is zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. Wait, but at r=0, the field isn't defined because 1/r² would be problematic.

So, if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere should be zero. Because the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere except possibly at a single point (r=0), which doesn't contribute to the volume integral (since a point has no volume).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about using the Divergence Theorem. Wait, the Divergence Theorem says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface of that volume. So the volume integral of div f is the flux through the sphere of radius R.

But wait, what is the flux here? Flux is the integral of f dot n over the surface. Since the field is radial and f(r) = 1/r², on the surface of the sphere (r=R), the field's magnitude is 1/R². The unit normal vector n at each point is also radial, so the dot product is just (1/R²) * R² = 1. So the flux is the integral
