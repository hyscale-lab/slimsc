Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think through each step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, which forms an alkene. So, heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH should give an alkene as the product. The product is a light yellow solid, which makes sense because alkenes are typically less polar than the starting dihalide.

Looking at the 1H NMR of product 1: the peaks are at 4.79 (2H), which is probably a pair of hydrogens adjacent to an oxygen, maybe an ether or an alcohol. Wait, no—if it's from an elimination, perhaps it's a diene? Or maybe the base caused an epoxide formation? Wait, no, KOH usually doesn't form epoxides; that's more of an acid-catalyzed reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the structure after elimination is an alkene, but why the NMR shows peaks at 4.79?

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, each Br would eliminate to form a double bond. So, the product would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps the more likely outcome is that each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond, leading to a structure where the adamantane has a conjugated diene somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br atoms on two adjacent carbons in the structure. Elimination would form a double bond between those two carbons. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or perhaps a single double bond? Wait, no—maybe it's a single double bond because if you eliminate two HXs (each Br with a H from adjacent C), you form one double bond. So for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would form an internal double bond, giving 1,3-diene? Or wait, maybe that's
