Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the question is about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis. We need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Wait, I remember that diffraction patterns depend on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles based on the width of the slit. But this is a polygon with N sides, and as N becomes really large, the shape becomes more like a circle, right? Or wait, no, wait. Because a polygon with a very large N would approximate a circle, but in this case, the apothems are all the same. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So when N is very large, the shape becomes more like a circle, but with a specific radius. Wait, maybe I'm confusing apothem with radius. Let me think: For a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R (the distance from the center to a vertex) by a = R * cos(π/N). Hmm, but when N is very large, π/N is very small, so cos(π/N) is approximately 1. So the apothem a is approximately equal to R. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

Wait, but wait. For a circle, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk, but the minima there are not as straightforward as the single slit. Single-slit has minima at specific angles, but for a circle, I think the first minima are at larger angles. Or is that right? Wait, no. Wait, the single-slit diffraction has minima at θ = (mλ)/(d), where d is the slit width and m is the order, starting at 1 for the first minimum. The central maximum is much wider than the others. But for a circular aperture, the minima are determined by the Bessel functions. The first minimum occurs at a certain angle, but it's not as simple as the single-slit case.
