Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question involves several reaction steps, and I need to figure out the structure of the final product, then determine how many distinct hydrogen signals its NMR spectrum would show.

The steps are:

1. Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Product 1 is formed.
2. Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. Product 2 is formed.
3. Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Product 3 is formed.
4. Product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane. Product 4 is the final product.

I need to find the number of distinct hydrogen signals in product 4's 1H NMR.

Let me tackle each step one by one.

Step 1: Acetic acid + Br2, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat.

Hmm, acetic acid reacting with Br2. Wait, but in what conditions? Pyridine is often used as a base and can help absorb HBr, maybe. Also, acetic anhydride is another component. Wait, could this be a bromination reaction?

I recall that acetic acid can undergo acetylation, but that's usually with acetic anhydride itself. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction. Wait, acetic
