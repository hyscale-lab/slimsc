Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh right, paramagnetic coupling terms usually involve the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. I remember that the magnetic dipole interaction energy is given by something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment.

Wait, the magnetic moment μ for an electron in an atom is related to its spin angular momentum. Oh right, μ = -gμ_B S, where g is the Landé g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. The Bohr magneton has a value of like 9.27e-24 J/T, if I recall correctly. And the magnetic dipole energy is H = -μ·B. So in this case, since B is along Oz, which I think is the z-axis, the energy would depend on the spin state.

Now, the orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Oh, right, m can be up to l, but for small m, maybe we're looking at lower-order terms or something else. Wait, no, m is the orbital quantum number. Wait, no, orbital magnetic quantum number is l. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is l, and the magnetic quantum number is m_l. But the problem says small values of m, which I think refers to the spin magnetic quantum number m_s. Because m_s can be ±1/2 for electrons.

So since m is small (like ±1/2), the paramagnetic term would relate to the spin interaction. The paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value would be proportional to m_s times something. But wait, in the hydrogen atom, the spin-orbit coupling is usually a perturbation, but I'm not sure how that ties into this problem.

Wait, the question is comparing the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is the Zeeman effect term due to the spin, with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom's transition energy here is given by a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. That's the Balmer series, right? The transition from n=2 to n=1, which emits a photon with wavelength about 0.486 micrometers. Or wait, no, the Balmer-alpha line is around 656 nm, so maybe this is another transition. Anyway, the energy can be found using E = hc/λ.

So first, let's compute ΔE. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters.

So ΔE = hc/(λ). Let me calculate that. Let's compute hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.
