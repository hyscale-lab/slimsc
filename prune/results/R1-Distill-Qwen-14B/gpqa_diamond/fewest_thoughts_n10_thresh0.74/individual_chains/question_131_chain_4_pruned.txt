Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid is dehydrated to form an anhydride. The anhydride has some specific NMR peaks. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two productsâ€”a major and a minor one. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3.

The important clue here is the NOESY NMR data. The major product shows a cross-peak, meaning there's some proximity between two protons, while the minor product doesn't. So, I need to figure out which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product based on the options given.

First, let me break down the initial steps.

The starting material is a cis-dicarboxylic acid. When you dehydrate a dicarboxylic acid, especially with a cis diol or a cis alkene, you typically form an anhydride. Since the starting acid has a cis-alkene, dehydration would form an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR tells me something about its structure.

The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aromatic proton? Wait, but anhydrides from dicarboxylic acids are usually cyclic, like a cyclic anhydride. Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, 7 ppm could be a proton near an electron-withdrawing group, like an ester or an anhydride oxygen.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbonyl carbons are usually around 165-220 ppm. The 137 ppm is likely a carbon attached to an oxygen, like an ester or ketone, but in an anhydride, there's the carbonyl and the adjacent oxygen-bearing carbon.

Wait, the anhydride from a
