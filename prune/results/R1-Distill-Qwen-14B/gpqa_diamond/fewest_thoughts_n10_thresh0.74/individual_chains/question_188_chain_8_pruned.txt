Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. For cubic systems, I know the formula, but rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees. Oh right, the Miller indices here are (111), so I need to use a specific formula for that.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals have all edges equal and all angles equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, but wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, which in a cubic system would be the lattice parameter 'a'. So maybe in this case, the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom. But I'm not entirely sure. I think for a rhombohedral system, it's similar to a cubic one in that the lattice parameter is the same along all axes, but the angles are different.

The interplanar distance formula for a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), where h, k, l are the Miller indices. But since this is a rhombohedral system, the formula must account for the angles. I recall that the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma is something like d = 1 / sqrt( (h² (2cos α)/(a²) ) + ... ) Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Oh wait, I think the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos γ) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos α) ) ). Or wait, no, that might not be right. Because in a cubic system, all angles are 90 degrees, so the cos terms would be zero, simplifying to the cubic formula.

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and the angles are all equal (alpha = beta = gamma). So maybe the formula simplifies. Let me think. For a rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ
