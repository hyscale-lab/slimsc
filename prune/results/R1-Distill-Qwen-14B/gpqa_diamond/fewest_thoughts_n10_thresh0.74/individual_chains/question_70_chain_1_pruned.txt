Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The problem describes a series of reactions leading to a product E, and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a different symmetry group.

First, I need to figure out what each of these substances could be based on the reactions described.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. So, 8 moles of B reacting with 1 mole of A. Hmm, I'm thinking maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen or something like that. Bright red productâ€”maybe a copper compound? For example, if A is copper and B is sulfur, but wait, copper and sulfur would form Cu2S, which is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal reacting with another element.

Wait, another red compound I know of is lead dioxide (PbO2), but that's dark brown. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Or perhaps a nitride or sulfide?

Wait, another thought. Maybe A is sulfur and B is something else. Or A is sodium and B is something else? But I'm not getting it yet.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C is reacting with D in a 1:2 ratio. What's a dangerous gas that reacts with something in a 2:1 ratio? Maybe D is chlorine gas, but reacting with C to form something dangerous. Alternatively, E could be something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps looking at the third reaction will help. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid; G is a weak acid. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A, F, and G. Let's think about possible compounds that do this.

If C is a sulfide, then hydrolysis could produce the corresponding metal hydroxide, but that would be a base, not an acid. Hmm. Alternatively, if C is a metal nitride, which on hydrolysis gives a metal hydroxide and ammonia (which is a weak acid if protonated). Wait, but then F would be a strong acid and G a
