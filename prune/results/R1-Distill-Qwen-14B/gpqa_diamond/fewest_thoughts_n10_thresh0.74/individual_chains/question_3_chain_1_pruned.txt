Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given as A, B, C, D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that expectation values involve taking the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So, for any operator O, the expectation ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

Since the operator is 10σz +5σx, the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, maybe it's easier to calculate that part.

The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Wait, wait, let me check: 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4), and 0.25 +0.75=1, so the state is normalized. Good.

The σz matrix, if I recall correctly, is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the eigenvalues for |↑⟩ is 1 and for |↓⟩ is -1.

So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the probability of being in |↑⟩ multiplied by 1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ multiplied by (-1).

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The probabilities are the square of the absolute values. So for |↑⟩, the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25, and for |↓⟩, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, let me double-check that. The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so yes, 0.5^2 is 0.25, and the coefficient for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, which squared is 3/4.

So, 0.25 *1 is 0.25, and 0.75 * (-1) is -0.75. So 0.25 -0.75 is indeed -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Okay, so 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, I need to compute ⟨σx⟩. Hmm. σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, but that might not directly help here. Alternatively, I can compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ directly.

Alternatively, since σx is the spin operator in the x-direction, and the expectation value can be found using the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it using the coefficients.

Let me represent the state ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1), ψ is 0.5*(1,0) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0,1) = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

So ψ = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T
