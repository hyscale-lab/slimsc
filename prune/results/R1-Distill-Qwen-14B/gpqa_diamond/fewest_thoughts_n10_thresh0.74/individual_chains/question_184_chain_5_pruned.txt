Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to determine which sequence correctly leads to the desired compound.

First, I'll try to understand the structure we're aiming for. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the ring: position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. So the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, which are adjacent to each other. Wait, no, that's not possible because in benzene, each position is adjacent to the next. Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the numbering would have substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. But in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to the next, so 1, 2, and 3 would be meta to each other, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each position is adjacent to the next. So positions 1, 2, and 3 would be in a sort of adjacent manner, but perhaps arranged in a way that they're all meta but that's not possible. Hmm, maybe I should sketch this out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the substituents' positions. Wait, perhaps the actual arrangement is that the substituents are in positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro), which are all adjacent. Wait, but that might lead to steric issues, but maybe that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in adjacent positions but with certain directing effects determining their placement.

Wait, no, perhaps I should approach this by considering the synthesis steps. The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (OEt), tert-butyl (t-Bu), and nitro
