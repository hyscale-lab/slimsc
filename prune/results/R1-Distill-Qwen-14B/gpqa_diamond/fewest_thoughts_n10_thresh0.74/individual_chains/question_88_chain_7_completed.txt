Okay, so I'm looking at this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, I need to figure out which process is happening based on the observations. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice via oral gavage. So, the mice swallowed these particles. Then, using in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches, I think. So the GFP made it there.

They isolated the proliferating cell population from the fluorescent Peyer patches. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and found high variability. So, what process leads to such variability in the variable regions?

The options are A to D. Let me recall what each process does.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation. I remember that this occurs in B cells during the immune response, especially in the germinal centers. It introduces mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors, increasing diversity and affinity for the antigen.

Option B: Complement activation. That's part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. Doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

Option C: Class switching recombination. This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it's about the constant region, not the variable parts. So probably not causing high variability in the variable heavy chain.

Option D: VDJ recombination. That's during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to create diversity. But wait, VDJ happens during the early development of B cells, in the bone marrow. If the cells are already in the Peyer's patches and have undergone proliferation, maybe this isn't it. Because VDJ is more about the initial diversity, not the subsequent changes.

So the question says they isolated proliferating cells. Proliferation in lymphoid tissues like Peyer's patches would be in places like the immune sites. So maybe this is related to the adaptive immune response.

Somatic hypermutation occurs after the initial B cell receptor is made. It's a process that happens in the germinal centers where B cells undergo mutations, leading to a higher variability in the antibodies produced. Since they observed high variability in the variable heavy chain after sequencing, that sounds like somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but I thought VDJ is also part of generating the variable regions. But VDJ is during the initial creation of the B cell receptor, right? So the variable regions are made through VDJ, but during the immune response, further mutations (somatic hypermutation) can increase the diversity even more.

In the question, the high variability is observed after the cells have been isolated from the Peyer patches where they're proliferating. Peyer patches are sites where B cells, especially those that have encountered antigens, can activate and undergo these processes.

So the process being described is likely somatic hypermutation because that's when the variable regions are being altered to create a more diverse and specific immune response.

Another point: the GFP was destroyed by stomach acid and mucus, but some reached the Peyer patches. So the rotavirus capsid proteins (with GFP) acted as antigens. When B cells in the Peyer patches (like in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue) take up these antigens, they process and present them. Then, during the immune response, B cells undergo proliferation and mutation in the variable regions to produce a better antibody fit.

So the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes must be due to somatic hypermutation, which introduces point mutations in the variable regions. That's option A.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but the GFP reaches the Peyer patches, where proliferating cells are isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain gene reveals high variability. This suggests a process that increases diversity in the variable regions of the B cell receptor.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation**  
  This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, introducing mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors to enhance diversity and antigen affinity. The observation of high variability in the variable heavy chain gene aligns with this mechanism.

- **Option B: Complement activation**  
  This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variability of the variable regions of B cell receptors. It is unlikely to explain the observed results.

- **Option C: Class switching recombination**  
  This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain. It is unrelated to the observed variability.

- **Option D: VDJ recombination**  
  This process generates the initial diversity of B cell receptors during early development in the bone marrow. However, it occurs before the immune response and does not account for the high variability observed in the proliferating cells in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, a process that occurs during the immune response in germinal centers, leading to increased diversity and specificity of B cell receptors. 

Answer: A
