Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what product 4 looks like. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic monoterpene, right? It has a specific configuration, either R or S. So (R) indicates it's the (R)-enantiomer, the one that's more common in citrus fruits like lemons.

First reaction: stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Oh, so hydrogenation. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, typically used to add hydrogen across double bonds. Limonene has a double bond, so adding hydrogen would saturate it. So limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond. Stirring in methanol with Pd/C and H2 would hydrogenate the double bond. But wait, limonene is a bicyclic compound. Let me visualize it: limonene is a bicyclic structure with one ring being a cyclohexene and the other a cyclopropane, I think. So when it's hydrogenated, the double bond in the cyclohexene part would add hydrogen, turning it into a cyclohexane. The cyclopropane ring is probably unaffected because it's not a double bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated form of limonene.

Wait, but the problem says that after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated as the major product. So maybe it's the partial hydrogenation, but I'm not sure. No, wait, limonene has a single double bond, I think. So one equivalent of H2 would fully hydrogenate it. So product 1 is the cyclohexane derivative, probably with some substituents.

Next step: product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid to form product 2. Cl-COO-BnCl? Wait, 3-chloroperbenzoic acid is an oxidizing agent, often used for epoxidation of alkenes. But wait, product 1 is fully hydrogenated, so no double bonds left. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, maybe I was wrong about the hydrogenation. Let me think again.

Wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterp
