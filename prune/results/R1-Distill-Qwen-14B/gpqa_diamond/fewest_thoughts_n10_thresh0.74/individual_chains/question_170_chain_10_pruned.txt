Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I think this is a two-component spinor, right? So χ = [3i, 4] transposed. Or wait, maybe it's a column vector? Because in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors. So the state is a column vector with the first component 3i and the second component 4.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = χ† σ_y χ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, each multiplied by ħ/2 for spin-1/2 particles like electrons. So, the spin operator S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y.

Wait, wait. Let me get the exact form of σ_y. From the note, σ_y is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So, σ_y is that 2x2 matrix. And S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y.

The expectation value is the bra-ket product: χ† σ_y χ.

Wait, no. Because the spin operator is S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value is ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩.

Right. So first, I need to compute ⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩, then multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value.

Let me write down the state χ as a column vector. So χ is:

[ 3i ]
[ 4 ]

So the bra vector χ† is [3i*, 4*], which is the conjugate transpose. Since 3i is 3i, its conjugate is -3i. And 4 is real, so 4* is 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, the expectation value computation is χ† σ_y χ.

Let me compute σ_y χ first. Let's compute that:

σ_y multiplied by χ
