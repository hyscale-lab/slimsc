Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with enthalpy calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. But wait, this problem has multiple acids and a base. Oh, wait, actually, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when they mix, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

But wait, I think first I should figure out how much H+ and OH- are present. Because the neutralization reaction depends on the moles of H+ and OH- available. The one in lesser quantity will determine the extent of reaction, I think.

So, let's calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

First, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity × Volume (in liters). 

HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too. But wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. In aqueous solution, does it dissociate completely both H+ ions? Well, the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-). So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. 

Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids
