Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, I remember that the magnetic moment mu for a particle is given by gamma times the spin component, right? So mu = gamma * S_z, where S_z is the spin in the z-direction.

The setup is that the particle is initially in a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Oh wait, but then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. So the magnetic field switches from Z to Y, same strength.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment. Oh right, when the magnetic field changes, the spin precesses, and that makes the expectation values oscillate.

Wait, I remember something about the precession frequency. It's related to the Larmor frequency, which is gamma times B. But wait, here the field is along Y now, so maybe the direction affects the frequency.

Wait, no, the frequency should depend on the component of the magnetic field along the quantization axis. Initially, the field was along Z, so the spin was aligned along Z. Then, the field is along Y. So the spin will precess around Y. The oscillation of the expectation value in the Z direction would come from the transition between spin-up and spin-down in that direction as the spin precesses around Y.

So the energy levels for a spin in a magnetic field are given by E = -mu·B. When the field is along Y, the energy states are determined by the projection along Y, which is S_y.

Wait, but when the field changes, the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the spin will precess around the new magnetic field axis, which is Y.

The time evolution of the spin state when the magnetic field is along Y would cause the expectation value of S_z to oscillate. The frequency of these oscillations would be determined by the energy difference between the spin states, which is proportional to the magnetic field strength and gamma.

The energy levels for a spin-1/2 particle in a magnetic field B along Y are E = ±(gamma * B/2), since S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but wait, the spin matrices are in units of ħ. Wait, no, the spin operator S has magnitude sqrt(s(s+1)) ħ, but for spin 1/2, S_z has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy E = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma S, then E = -gamma B S·n, where n is the direction of B.

Wait, in this case, the field is along Y, so E = gamma B S_y. Wait, no, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is -mu · B. So E = -gamma B S_y.

But wait, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = -gamma B (ħ/2). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, mu = gamma S. So, the energy is E = - mu · B. Since the field is along Y, mu · B = gamma B S_y. So E = - gamma B S_y.

Wait, but that would mean E = - gamma B S_y. But S_y is an operator, so the energy eigenvalues for spin up and down along Y are E = ± (gamma B ħ/2), because S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference between the two states is E_up - E_down = [gamma B (ħ/2)] - [gamma B (-ħ/2)] = gamma B ħ.

But the frequency of oscillations in the expectation value is related to the energy difference divided by h-bar, because the time period comes from E = h f, so f = E/(h) = (E)/(h-bar * 2 pi) * 2 pi. Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of the energy levels and the Rabi oscillations.

Wait, another approach: The Hamiltonian after the field is turned along Y is H = - mu · B = -gamma B S_y.

The time evolution of the state is given by the Schrödinger equation. The energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y. The initial state was aligned along +Z, which is |+z> = (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2)} or something like that. Wait, no, the initial state when the field is along Z would have the spin aligned along Z, so the initial state is |+z>, which is (|+> + |->)/sqrt(2)? Wait, no, wait. The spin-up state along Z is |+z> = |+> in the computational basis, which can be written as (|+x> + i |+y>)/sqrt(2)} or something else. I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the expectation value. The expectation value of S_z in the state will oscillate at a frequency related to the energy splitting.

The energy levels are E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2) and E_- = -gamma B (ħ/2), assuming I got the signs right. The energy difference is E_+ - E_- = gamma B ħ.

The time period T for the oscillations is given by the energy difference divided by h-bar. So T = (2 pi ħ) / (E_+ - E_-) )= (2 pi ħ) / (gamma B ħ) ) = 2 pi/(gamma B).

So the oscillation frequency is f = 1/T = gamma B/(2 pi) ) * 2 pi → wait no, wait, no: E_+ - E_- is 2*(gamma B ħ/2) )= gamma B ħ. So the energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ. So the frequency is (delta E)/(hbar) ) / (2 pi) )? Wait, no.

Wait, Planck's relation is E = h f. So f = E/h. But in terms of hbar, E = ħ ω. So the frequency ω is E/ħ.

The energy difference is delta E = gamma B ħ. So delta E = ħ * (gamma B). So the angular frequency would be delta E / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but wait, that would suggest that the oscillation frequency is gamma B. But looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The oscillation in the expectation value of S_z occurs because the state is a superposition of the energy eigenstates. The time evolution leads to oscillations in expectation values at the Rabi frequency, which is determined by the energy difference between the states.

Another approach: The Hamiltonian is H = gamma B S_y. The time evolution operator is exp(-i H t / ħ). For spin-1/2, S_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. So H = gamma B (ħ/2) sigma_y.

The energy eigenvalues are E_± = gamma B (ħ/2) * (±1). So the energies are ± (gamma B ħ)/2.

The energy difference is (gamma B ħ)/2 - (-gamma B ħ/2) ) = gamma B ħ.

So the oscillation frequency for the expectation value is (gamma B ħ) / ħ ) / (2 pi) )= (gamma B) / (2 pi) * 2 pi? No, wait, the angular frequency ω is (E_+ - E_- ) / ħ = (gamma B ħ) / ħ = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency (angular frequency) is gamma B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component. So the frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma*B.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the direction. When the magnetic field is along Y, the spin will precess around Y. The expectation value of S_z will oscillate sinusoidally. The frequency of oscillation is determined by the energy splitting, which is gamma B.

So the answer should be B) gamma*B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the +Z direction. When the field is suddenly switched to point along the +Y direction, the particle's spin precesses around the new field axis. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

Initially, the particle is in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with the magnetic field along +Z. After the field is switched to +Y, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\mu \cdot B = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenvalues of $S_y$ are $\pm \hbar/2$, so the energy eigenvalues are $E_+ = \gamma B \hbar / 2$ and $E_- = -\gamma B \hbar / 2$. The energy difference between these states is:

\[
\Delta E = E_+ - E_- = \gamma B \hbar.
\]

The oscillation frequency of the expectation value of $S_z$ is determined by the energy splitting. Using the relation $\omega = \Delta E / \hbar$, the angular frequency of oscillation is:

\[
\omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = \gamma B.
\]

Thus, the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the particle's magnetic moment is $\gamma B$. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B) $\gamma B$**
