Okay, I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I'll read the question again. So, each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO," and similarly, HIRES can observe brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, but wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17. So, ESPRESSO can see stars with apparent V mag less than 17, and HIRES can see below 16. So, a star must have an apparent magnitude (V) less than 17 for ESPRESSO, and less than 16 for HIRES.

Now, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <17 (because ESPRESSO is brighter than 17, which I think is actually fainter than magnitude 17). Wait, wait. Wait, no, the way it's worded is that ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17. Oh, wait
