Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully. 

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, TLC showed the reactant spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. The options are four possible structures for the products. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I should draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking that down: the benzene ring has an ether oxygen attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. Specifically, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the chain is four carbons long, with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, waitâ€”no, wait. Let me double-check the numbering. Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl would mean the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. Because the substituent is butenyl, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between C2 and C3. Also, the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl, so on C2, there are two methyl groups. So the structure is: the butenyl group is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. No, wait: but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, wait, butenyl is four carbons. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 3 and 4? No, wait, but-1-en-3-yl might be different, but here it's but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait the correct structure.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2
