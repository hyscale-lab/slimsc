Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Hmm, I remember that for Pauli matrices, when you have a dot product like σ · n, it's like taking the sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n. So σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Right, but n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, and the eigenvalues of such a matrix... Oh right, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1, but when they're multiplied by some coefficients and summed, the eigenvalues of the resulting matrix depend on the coefficients. But I think there's a general way to find the eigenvalues of a matrix like σ · n.

Oh wait, another thought: I remember that the trace of σ · n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the sum's trace is zero. And the determinant would be (i think) -1, because each Pauli matrix's determinant is -1, but wait, not exactly sure about that. Or perhaps the determinant of σ · n is 1, because the determinant of a sum depends on the product of eigenvalues. Wait, if the eigenvalues are ± some value, then their product is negative of the square of that value. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the eigenvalues of the matrix σ · n. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1 multiplied by the magnitude of the vector (but in this case, the vector has magnitude 1 because n is a unit vector). Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Each Pauli matrix is traceless and has eigenvalues ±1. So if I have a matrix like a·σ, where a is a vector, then the eigenvalues of a·σ would be ±|a|. Because the matrix a·σ is a linear combination of Pauli matrices scaled by the components of a. So the eigenvalues would be plus
