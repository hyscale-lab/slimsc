Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I remember that particles like mesons are bosons, usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances are like unstable particles that don't last very long before decaying. So, their mean lifetime is really short, which would make their decay distance really small too. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

The given data is E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. I think the key here is to find the mean lifetime of the particle and then multiply it by its velocity to get the decay distance. Oh right, because the mean decay distance (often called the proper mean decay length) is c multiplied by the lifetime.

Wait, the lifetime is related to the width Γ. I remember that the uncertainty principle tells us that the width Γ is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Oh wait, but sometimes people use Γ = ħ τ, so I need to get that right. Let me think: the natural linewidth is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that's correct.

But wait, another thing: when a particle is moving at a relativistic speed, its lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime. Because of time dilation. So the mean lifetime observed is gamma times the proper lifetime. But wait, no, the proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. So when we calculate the decay distance, we have to consider the particle's speed. Because the decay distance is L = v * gamma * τ * c? Or wait, let me clarify.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is the proper lifetime. So the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. The velocity v is approximately c for high-energy particles since gamma is large. So the decay distance is v * gamma * tau. But wait, v is approximately c, so L ≈ c * gamma * tau.

But how do I find gamma? Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the energy and the mass. So E is the total energy, which is gamma * m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). Let's see, in the given problem, E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV. So gamma would be 8 / 1.2. Let me compute that: 8 divided by 1.2 is approximately 6.6667, or 6 and two-thirds.

Wait, but wait, units are in GeV. Oh, but when calculating gamma, the units of E and m are the same (GeV to GeV), so it's unitless, which is correct because gamma is a ratio.

So gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.666... So about
