Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me think through this step by step.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is a unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Okay, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each a 2x2 matrix. When you take their dot product with a vector n, you're essentially taking a linear combination of these matrices weighted by the components of n.

So, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the equation H |ψ> = E |ψ>, which translates to the characteristic equation det(H - E I) = 0, where I is the identity matrix. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than computing this from scratch.

Pauli matrices have some interesting properties. Each Pauli matrix, when squared, gives the identity matrix times 1. Like, σx² = I, same for σy and σz. Also, the dot product σ · n is a matrix, and I think it's Hermitian since it's a sum of Hermitian matrices multiplied by real coefficients (n is a unit vector, so its components are real).

Wait, the trace of σ · n. The trace of a Pauli matrix is zero. So the trace of σ · n would also be zero because each σ_i has trace zero, and the sum would too. Hmm, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues. So if the trace is zero, the sum of the eigenvalues must be zero. That suggests that the eigenvalues are symmetric around zero.

Now, what about the determinant? The determinant of σ · n. Well, for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant of (aσx + bσy + cσz) would be... wait, I think the determinant of a Pauli matrix vector (σ · n) is 1 for each individual Pauli matrix, but when you have a linear combination, maybe it's different. Alternatively, no, each σ_i is traceless and has determinant -1. Wait, let me check. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. For example, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], whose determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Similarly for σ
