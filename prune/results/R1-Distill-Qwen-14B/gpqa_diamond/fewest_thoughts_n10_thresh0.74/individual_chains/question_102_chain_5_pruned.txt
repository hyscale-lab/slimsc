Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The person is using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector to study their interaction. So, bicistronic means it has two coding regionsâ€”in this case, the ligand and the receptor.

The setup of the vector: the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Wait, so the ligand is first, then the receptor. Oh, and there are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 between them. I remember that loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, and Cre recombinase can recognize and excise the DNA between them, but only if they're in a certain configuration.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, typically used for expression in various tissues, including the brain. The receptor has an IRES element upstream. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which can drive the translation of the downstream ORF without the need for a second promoter. So, the ligand is expressed via the CBA promoter, and the receptor via the IRES, which is after the ligand.

Wait, but how does the vector work? So the vector is designed with the ligand first, then the IRES, then the receptor, right? Because the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. But the vector also has stop cassettes. Between ligand and mCherry is a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. So, that means that without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent expression of the ligand's tag (mCherry) and the receptor's tag (eGFP). But when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes and allowing the tags to be expressed.

Wait, but the setup is a bit more confusing. The ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry.
