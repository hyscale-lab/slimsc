Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of interpreting spectral data. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the given data.

Let me start by looking at the information provided.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and is 100%, which suggests the molecular weight is 156. The next peak is at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, that's a bit higher than 156. Maybe it's a fragment or another ion, like a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has isotopes, so if the molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion could have two peaks: one at the main mass and another at +2, since Cl usually has about 35 (75%) and 37 (25%) isotopes. So 156 and 158 could be M and M+2, but wait, in the mass spec, the base peak is M at 156. So the molecular formula probably includes a Cl.

Looking at the IR data: broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But where? A broad peak could be from a carboxylic acid (which is usually a very broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1) or maybe an alcohol or phenol. But wait, phenols also have broad O-H stretches, but sometimes they can be a bit lower. Another strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong peak which is likely a carbonyl (C=O). 1720 could correspond to a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid (which are typically around 1700-1720 cm^-1), or maybe an ester or something similar. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, but in the IR, the carbonyl would be around 1700. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is usually a bit higher, around 1740, but it can vary. Hmm.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), which is a singlet. That's most likely an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm), but wait, wait, noâ€”wait aldehydes are usually 9-10, but that's a singlet. But wait, 11 ppm is even higher. Oh, maybe it's a carboxylic acid's -OH proton? Wait, no, carboxylic acids typically
