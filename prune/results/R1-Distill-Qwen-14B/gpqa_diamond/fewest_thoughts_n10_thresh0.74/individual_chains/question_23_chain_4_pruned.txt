Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which of the options (A-D) could be the products.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize what's happening. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking that down: the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Let me draw that.

The butenyl group is four carbons. Position 1 is where it's attached to the oxygen. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, wait. No, because but-3-enyl has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So numbering starts from the oxygen. So the chain is: O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. For but-3-enyl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But butenyl has four carbons. So numbering starts from the point of attachment. So the structure of the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Hold on. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Structure would be:

The substituent is attached to O via carbon 1. So it's 1-yl. So the chain is 1,2,3,4: but-3-enyl. So:

1: CH2-

2: C(CH3)2 (because it's 2,2-dimethyl)

3: CH-

4: CH2

Wait, but wait. The structure should be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, that's butyl. But the double bond is between 3 and 4
