Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options, a through d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. The options are labeled A through D, each corresponding to one of the a-d choices. So first, I need to understand each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. I think Earth's average density is around 5.5 g/cm³. So if this planet has the same mass and radius, its density should be the same as Earth's. So option a's density is about 5.5 g/cm³.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. The question says it has a density of 5.5. So regardless of mass, if the density is given, that's already the value. So this planet's density is 5.5. But wait, is that possible? Because if a planet has more mass, perhaps its radius also increases. But here, the question states that the density is about 5.5, so I don't need to calculate it. So option b's density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So Earth's composition implies similar density. Because density is mass divided by volume. If the composition is the same, the density should be the same as Earth's. Wait, but mass increases but radius also increases. Oh wait, because if you have more mass but same composition, the radius would be larger. Let me think. The mass is 5 times Earth's. So Earth's mass is M, so this planet is 5M. Since density is mass/volume, and volume is (4/3)πr³. If the composition is same, the density should be same as Earth. So Earth's density is 5.5, so this planet's density is also 5.5. So option c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth, but half the mass. So similar to Earth, same density. So density is 5.5.

Wait, wait. But I think I'm making a mistake here. Because if the planet's mass changes but the composition is same, the radius would scale with mass^(
