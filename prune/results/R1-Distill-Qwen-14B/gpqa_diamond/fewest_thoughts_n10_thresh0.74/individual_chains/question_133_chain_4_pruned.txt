Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again and jot down the details.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think I need to figure out the concentrations of each of these salts in the solution. Then, perhaps consider some kind of equilibrium to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, but I remember that when you mix a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can form a buffer solution. But in this case, what exactly do we have here? Let me think about the salts.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4). When dissolved in water, I think it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, which can act as an acid (since it can donate another proton) or a base (by accepting a proton).

On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. So when it dissolves, it should give Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. HPO4^2- is the hydrogen phosphate ion, which is the conjugate base of H2PO4^- (since H2PO4^- donates a proton to become HPO4^2-). So HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (accept a proton to become H2PO4^-).

So in solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That sounds like a buffer solution where the two species are conjugate acid and base of each other. Since H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are part of the same phosphate system, maybe I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Wait, the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Oh, but PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So in the solution, PO4^3- would be formed if HPO4^2- loses a proton. But under what conditions does that happen? Well, considering the Ka values, the third dissociation step (from HPO4^2- to PO4^3-) has a very small Ka (1.8e-12), so it's a very weak acid. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be really low.

Wait, but if the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then the pH of the solution might be around the pKa2 of H3PO4, right? Because H2PO4^- is the acid and HPO4^2- is its conjugate base. So the relevant pKa would be Ka2, which is 6.2e-8, so pKa2 is log inverse. Let me calculate that.

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21. So the pH of the solution should be around this value.

But wait, the problem is about PO4^3- concentration. Which comes from HPO4^2- losing a proton. So the relevant Ka here is Ka3, which is 1.8e-12. Because HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

So, if I can find the concentration of H+ in the solution, I can use that and the concentration of HPO4^2- to find PO4^3-.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the solution as a buffer solution and find the pH, then use that to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, so the buffer is made of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]).

In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-.

So I need to find the concentrations of each in the solution.

First, let's calculate the number of moles of each salt.

Moles of KH2PO4: mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, but wait: The formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissolves, each formula unit gives 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

So the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·
