Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that a particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which is given by (1/2)k r² plus (3/2)k r² cos²θ. We need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that potentials in quantum mechanics can often be solved by separating the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. But wait, in two dimensions, maybe it's a polar coordinate system, so r and θ make sense here.

The potential V(r,θ) can be written as (k r²/2) (1 + 3 cos²θ). Let me see, that's the same as (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Wait, 1 is cos²θ + sin²θ, so 1 + 3 cos²θ = cos²θ + sin²θ + 3 cos²θ = 4 cos²θ + sin²θ. Hmm, maybe that's a way to rewrite it, but I'm not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the potential in terms of polar coordinates. The first part is (1/2)k r², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. Because in one dimension, the harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x², but here it's (1/2)k r² for r, maybe that's a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator? Wait, no, isotropic would be same in all directions, but here the potential has an angular component as well.

Wait, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out k r²/2. So, it's (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of some effective potential that can be broken into radial and angular parts.

Wait, in the radial Schrödinger equation, the potential contributes to the effective potential experienced by the particle. Let me think about the angular part. The term involving cos²θ suggests that the potential has
