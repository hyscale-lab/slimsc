Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions to high speeds, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas involved.

Wait, the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li usually has 3 protons. Oh right, lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. The atomic mass would be the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. But wait, I think in particle physics, when we're dealing with ions, we often use the rest mass of the nucleus, which is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but perhaps considering binding energy? Or maybe for high-energy calculations, we can approximate it using the rest mass?

So, the formula I need is probably the relativistic energy of a particle. Oh right, the total energy of a relativistic particle is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So the steps I think I should take are:

1. Find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.
2. Calculate gamma for v = 0.96c.
3. Multiply gamma by the rest mass energy to get the total energy.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the rest mass of a nucleus is the mass when it's not moving. But when we talk about the energy in a collider, each ion has kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Or wait, in particle physics, the energy is usually given as kinetic plus rest mass, but sometimes when they say "energy", they're referring to the kinetic energy. Hmm, but the question says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider", which I think refers to the total energy (kinetic plus rest mass), but I'm not entirely sure. Oh wait, no, wait. RHIC accelerators typically refer to the kinetic energy as the main component, but sometimes it's given in terms of the beam energy as the kinetic energy. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, sometimes physicists refer to the beam energy as the kinetic energy plus rest energy, but I think in this context, the question is probably asking for the total energy (gamma * m c²), which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy.

So, I'll proceed with the assumption that the energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So, I need to calculate gamma first.

v is 0.96c. Let me compute beta first: beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me calculate 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. But let me make sure: 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So 1/0.28 is approximately 3.571428... Hmm, maybe more accurately, let me compute it more precisely. Let me compute 1 - 0.96^2 more accurately.

Wait, 0.96 is 24/25, so 0.96^2 is (24/25)^2 = 576/625 = 0.9216. So yes, 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So the total rest mass would be (3 * 938) + (3 * 939.565). Let's compute that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV.
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.
Adding them together: 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. 

Wait, but wait. The exact mass of
