Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which physical theory among the options doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

First, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like infinities that pop up in calculations. It helps make the theory mathematically consistent by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle these infinities before they're canceled out with renormalization.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is a candidate because it's a theory that aims to be a quantum theory of gravity. I remember that in string theory, the fundamental objects are strings rather than point particles. One of the key features of string theory is that it doesn't have the same kind of divergences as in other quantum field theories because it's a background-independent theory. Or wait, maybe it's because it's a theory that works at all energy scales without needing a cutoff. Oh right, string theory includes a mechanism where the energy scale is related to the string length, so perhaps it doesn't require regularization in the same way as other QFTs. I think that's the case because it's supposed to be a theory that doesn't have the same divergent loop diagrams as in, say, QCD or QED.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. I remember that QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory and that it's asymptotically free. But I also remember that in QCD calculations, especially in perturbative expansions, you do get divergences. So they must use regularization methods like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization to handle these infinities before renormalization. So QCD requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. I know that in QED, you definitely have divergences. For example, the electron has a self-energy divergence, and the Coulomb potential at short distances has issues. These are handled through regularization techniques. So QED requires regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't usually have the same kind of divergences that quantum theories have. Classical ED deals with Maxwell's equations and doesn't involve quantum effects, so things like infinities in charge densities or current densities don't arise. I remember that in classical theory, you can have issues with point charges having infinite charge density, but I think that's a different kind of problem and not something that requires regularization as in quantum field theory. Because classical theories don't use the same renormalization techniques, they don't need regularization in the same sense as quantum theories. So maybe the answer is D.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if I'm considering each theory's necessity for regularization techniques, particularly at high energies.

Wait, Superstring Theory doesn't require regularization because it's a background-independent theory and perhaps doesn't have the same loop divergences. Or do string theories require regularization? No, wait, I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansions involve string diagrams which are different from Feynman diagrams. But do they still have divergences that require regularization? I'm a bit
