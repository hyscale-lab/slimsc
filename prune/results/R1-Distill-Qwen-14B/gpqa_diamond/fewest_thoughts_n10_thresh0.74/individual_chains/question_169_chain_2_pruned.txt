Okay, so I've got this physics question here about nuclear decay, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think through it carefully.

The question is about a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A decay into two B nucleons, emitting particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. It's given that the E particles' energy spectrum is continuous with a maximum value Q. Then, there's a variant where instead of two V particles, they emit one exotic, massless particle M. The question is how the E particles' energy spectrum changes in this variant.

Hmm. I remember that in decay processes, the nature of the emitted particles affects the energy spectrum. I think in beta decay, for instance, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because some energy is carried away by the antineutrino. But wait, in this case, the original decay emits two E and two V particles, and the E's have a continuous spectrum. So maybe V carries away some energy as well.

Wait, the initial decay: 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The total energy is conserved. But if E's have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies vary. I think that in such cases, the particles are not all emitted with the same energy because the decay allows for a distribution of energies as long as the total energy and momentum are conserved.

In the original setup, E and V are being emitted. Now, in the variant, instead of two V's, there's one massless M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, but wait: the original decay has 2E and 2V, so 4 particles. The variant has 2E and 1M, so 3 particles. Also, M is massless, so it's like a photon or a neutrino or something similar.

I think this has to do with the conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think about the original decay. Since E's have a continuous spectrum, that means that the energy they carry isn't fixed—it varies, allowing for a range of possible energies. This is because the particles are emitted in different directions, and their energies depend on the angles due to momentum conservation.

If in the variant, instead of two V's, we have a single M, which
