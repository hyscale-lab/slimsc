Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. 

Hmm, let me start by identifying each component. I think I need to find out what X, Y, W, G, and B are. 

First, gas W: its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, the total number of protons would be the sum of protons in each atom, and same with neutrons. But wait, molecules have atoms, so maybe W is a diatomic molecule? Let me think. If the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, that would mean for each molecule, the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons. So, for example, if W is H2O, that's 8 protons (H2 is 2, O is 8) and the neutrons would be 10 (each H has 0, O has 8; wait, but wait, O's atomic number is 8, so number of neutrons would be 8 for oxygen-16. But then, H2O: each H has 0 neutrons, O has 8. So protons are 2+8=10, neutrons are 8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Another thought: if W is CO2. C has 6 protons, O has 8 each. So in CO2, protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 + 2*8 = 22. So protons and neutrons are equal. That could fit. So is CO2 a possible W?

Alternatively, could it be something else
