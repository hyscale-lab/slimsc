Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R.

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² radially. So that means the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, in spherical coordinates, the vector field can be written as f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector.

The task is to compute the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So, the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere.

Hmm, I remember that the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the surface integral of the field over the boundary. But wait, the divergence theorem says that ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dS, where n is the outward unit normal vector. So, that's the flux through the surface.

But wait, the problem is in a sphere, so the surface is at r = R. The vector field f at the surface is (1/R²) er. So, when I take the dot product of f with the normal vector (which is er at the surface), I get (1/R²) er · er, which is just 1/R².

So the surface integral would be ∫∫ (1/R²) dS. The surface area of a sphere is 4 π R², so the integral becomes (1/R²) * 4 π R² = 4 π. So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral would be 4 π.

Wait, but wait a second. What is the divergence of f inside the volume? Let me compute that directly. The vector field is only radial, so in spherical coordinates, the divergence ∇ · f is given by (1/(r² sinθ)) [d(f_r sinθ)/dr * sinθ + ... (other terms for θ and φ derivatives)]. But since f has only the r component and it's purely radial, the other terms must be zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(f_r r²)/dr.

Wait, f_r is 1/r², so f_r r² is (1/r²) * r² = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇ · f = 0 except at r=0. Oh
