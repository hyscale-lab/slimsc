Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and only has a radial component. So, the field is radial and falls off like 1/r².

Hmm, I remember from my studies that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a given point. The divergence theorem comes into play here, right? Which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface. But wait, let me make sure I'm thinking correctly.

The problem states that the field is along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, in spherical coordinates, the vector field would be f(r) = (F_r, 0, 0), where F_r is the radial component. Given that the magnitude is 1/r², F_r must be 1/r². Because for a radial vector field, the magnitude is just the radial component in spherical coordinates.

So, f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector. Now, I need to compute the divergence of this field. Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a vector field A in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r) / dr + r sinθ (1/r) d(A_θ)/dθ + r (1/(r sinθ)) d(A_φ)/dφ)].

But wait, since our vector field only has the radial component, A_θ and A_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies a lot. It'll just be (1/r²) * d(r² A_r)/dr.

Substituting A_r = 1/r², we get (1/r²) * d(r² * (1/r²)) / dr. Let's compute that. r² * 1/r² is 1, so the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So divergence of f is zero everywhere except at the origin, right?

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral over any volume not including the origin would be zero. But if the volume includes the origin, like in
