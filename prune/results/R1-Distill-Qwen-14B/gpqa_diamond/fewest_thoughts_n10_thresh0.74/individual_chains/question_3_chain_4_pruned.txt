Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle. Alright, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the state of the system and the operator in question.

The particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, right? So σ_z is the Pauli z-matrix. I think σ_z has eigenvalues +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. Oh, right, because σ_z |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σ_z |↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩.

But the question isn't directly about σ_z. It's about the operator 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator. Oh, right, expectation values are linear, so I can separate this into two parts: the expectation of 10σ_z plus the expectation of 5σ_x.

Wait, but expectation values are linear, so E[10σ_z +5σ_x] =10 E[σ_z] +5 E[σ_x]. That should make things easier. So I can compute E[σ_z] and E[σ_x] separately and then combine them.

First, let's compute E[σ_z]. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z, the expectation of σ_z is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me verify the normalization. The square of the coefficients should add up to 1. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So the state is normalized. Great.

So the probability of being in |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the probability of |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

The expectation value E[σ_z] is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So 10σ_z's expectation is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the next part is σ_x. Hmm, σ_x is the Pauli x-matrix. Its eigenstates are different though, right? Wait, I'm not sure. But for an operator, the expectation value can be found using the state's components.

Alternatively, I can write σ_x as a matrix and compute <ψ|σ_x|ψ>, where |ψ> is the given state.

The state |ψ> is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. Usually
