Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene and ending with product 3, and we're supposed to determine its molecular symmetry group.

Alright, let's break it down. First, the initial reaction: toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. From what I remember, nitric acid is a strong nitrating agent, especially when used with a catalyst like sulfuric acid. Toluene undergoes nitration, right? So the product 1 should be nitrotoluene. But where does the nitro group attach? Since toluene is methylbenzene, the nitration should occur at the para position because the methyl group is activating and directs the incoming nitro group to the para position. Wait, wait, nitration is a meta-directing group, but wait no, the methyl is an activating group, which is ortho/para directing. So the product 1 is para-nitrotoluene. So structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with a nitro group at the para position relative to the methyl group.

Next, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. I'm a bit fuzzy on this reaction. MnO2 is manganese dioxide; in acidic conditions, I think it's a strong oxidizing agent. So for nitrotoluene, perhaps the methyl group attached to the ring is getting oxidized. Wait, toluene's methyl group is attached to the benzene, so in nitrotoluene, the methyl is at position 4 relative to the nitro group. Upon oxidation, the methyl group might get oxidized to a carboxylic acid. But wait, MnO2 in H2SO4 is a typical condition for the oxidation of methyl groups to COOH. So the methyl (CH3) becomes COOH. So product 2 would be benzoic acid with the nitro group attached. So the structure would be nitrobenzoic acid. But wait, where is the nitro group located? Since the starting material was para-nitrotoluene, when the methyl becomes COOH, the nitro group is now at the para position relative to the COOH group. So it's para-nitrobenzoic acid. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Toluene is methylbenzene. Nitration adds nit
