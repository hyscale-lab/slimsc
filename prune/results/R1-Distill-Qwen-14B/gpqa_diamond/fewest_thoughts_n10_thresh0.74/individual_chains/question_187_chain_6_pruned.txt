Okay, so I have this question about which stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Hmm, let's see. I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. The question is about whether each star meets a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

The options are stars a to f. I need to figure out which ones would be detectable. I think the key factors here are the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude) because S/N depends on how much light the telescope can gather.

Wait, right, because the further a star is, the fainter it appears. Also, the V magnitude relates to the brightness in the visual spectrum. Absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear at 10 parsecs, but for our purposes, we need the apparent magnitude to calculate how bright it is from Earth.

So for each star, I have to compute the apparent magnitude. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d / 10), where M is the absolute magnitude, and d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, wait, no, actually it's m - M =5 log10(d) -5. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5 +5? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The correct formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) + 5, because m = M + 5*(log10(d) - 1), which is M +5 log10(d) -5. So m = M +5 log10(d) -5? No, wait, no. Let me correct this.

The formula is m = M + 5 * (log10(d) - 1). So m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. So yes, that's correct. Because the zero point is when d=10 pc, and then m = M.

Let me compute the apparent magnitude for each star.

Option a: Canopus. I think Canopus is a very bright star. I remember that Canopus has an apparent magnitude around -0.7 or something like that. So m is about -0.7. That's super bright. Definitely detectable.

Option b: Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. Its apparent magnitude is about 1.97. So m is around 2. So it's quite bright. So it should be detectable.

Option c: Absolute V magnitude 15, located at 10 pc. So m = M +5*(log10(10)) -5. Log10(10) is 1, so 5*1=5. m=15 +5 -5 =15. So apparent magnitude 15. Hmm, is that detectable? Wait, how does S/N relate to magnitude?

I remember that for a given telescope and instrument, the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and the brightness of the object. But in this case, the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour.
