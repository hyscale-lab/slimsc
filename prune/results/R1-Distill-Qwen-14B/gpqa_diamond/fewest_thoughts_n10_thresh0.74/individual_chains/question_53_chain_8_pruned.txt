Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that means there's an ester functional group in the molecule. Ester groups usually have carbonyl (C=O) which shows up around 1700 cm⁻¹ in IR. So I can note that the molecule has an ester.

Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It shows six signals. Let me break down each part. 

First, two signals correspond to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents will determine the splitting. For a di-substituted ring, depending on the substituents, the aromatic protons can be in different environments. If the substituents are ortho, meta, or para, the splitting patterns change. Considering that in aromatic rings, para substitution gives equivalent protons, but ortho and meta would have different situations. Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests perhaps two different sets of aromatic protons. So maybe it's para substitution? Because in para, the substituents are opposite each other, making the adjacent protons equivalent. Hmm, wait no, for para substitution on a benzene, the structure would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. Wait, let me think again. If the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be in two equivalent pairs. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating for two protons. But wait, the question says two signals for aromatic-H, each integrating for... Well, I'm not told the integration, but the signals are two. So maybe it's para substitution with two equivalent protons each. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and another is something else, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution? Let me think.

Wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. One of them is an ester group, perhaps. So if the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic protons would be two sets, each with two
