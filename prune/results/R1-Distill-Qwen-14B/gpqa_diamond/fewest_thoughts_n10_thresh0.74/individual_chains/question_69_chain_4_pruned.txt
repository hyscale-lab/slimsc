Okay, so I've got this physics problem here from the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question is about a decay process: X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The problem asks what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so I'm supposed to find the minimum resolution of the detector or something related to the decay length or the distance the particles travel before decaying. Oh right, the resolution probably refers to the detector's ability to distinguish particles based on their paths, so it needs to be able to see the decay point clearly.

I remember that the lifetime of a moving particle as observed in the lab frame is longer than its proper lifetime due to time dilation. So the lifetime τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, to find the decay length, I need to calculate how far the particle travels before decaying. Decay length L is the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So L = v * τ.

But wait, how do I find v? Oh, since the particle is moving at relativistic speeds, perhaps I can use the relation between energy and mass to find the velocity. The energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV.

I recall that the total energy E of a particle is given by E = γ m c². So γ is E/(m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV and c is in m/s, but the units might cancel out somehow?

Let me think. Let's compute γ first. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. Hmm, around 7.92.

Wait, but wait another thing—does the energy include rest mass or is it kinetic? Oh, right, in high-energy physics, the energy E is usually the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic. So yes, E = γ m c².

So γ is 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.9
