Okay, so I've got this physics question here about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the options is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that when a system undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking, it means the system ends up in a state that doesn't exhibit the full symmetry of the underlying laws. This often leads to the appearance of new particles called Goldstone bosons. Wait, but Goldstone's theorem says that for each broken continuous symmetry, there's a massless boson. But in some cases, like when there's a discrete symmetry or other complications, maybe that doesn't apply.

The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

Let me go through each one.

Pion: I know pions are associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD. Chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the vacuum of QCD, so pions are the Goldstone bosons there. So pions are linked to broken symmetry.

Phonon: Phonons are related to the quantized sound waves in crystals, right? They arise from the lattice vibrations. I think in crystalline solids, the translational symmetry is broken because the atoms are arranged in a periodic structure. Wait, but the phonon's existence is due to the breaking of translational symmetry. But wait, phonons are more about the quantized vibrations, which come from the fact that the crystal has a periodic structureâ€”so the original translational symmetry is broken into a discrete set of points. Hmm, so maybe the phonon doesn't come from a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry. Or perhaps phonons are related to symmetry breaking in another way. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Magnon: Magnons are like the quasiparticles for spin waves in magnets. So when a magnetic material undergoes a phase transition, like ferromagnetism, the symmetry is broken. The spin waves (magnons) are the Goldstone bosons for that broken rotational symmetry. So magnons come from spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Skyrmion: Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain magnetic materials. They arise from the breaking of symmetry, but I'm not exactly sure which kind. Skyrmions are more topological in nature, meaning their existence is due to nontrivial mappings in the material's symmetry. I think they can appear when there's a broken symmetry, but maybe not the same as the Goldstone boson scenario. Wait, or perhaps they emerge from pionic fields, which are themselves Goldstone bosons, but that's getting a bit complicated.

So putting it together: the question is which particle is NOT associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Pion, magnon, and phonon are all linked to broken symmetries. Wait, but wait, phonons are in crystals which have broken translational symmetry. So phonons are a result of that, but is it spontaneous? Or is it more about the crystal structure being in a particular state (so symmetry broken) but phonons are like the excitations around that structure. So yes, the phonon's existence comes from the broken symmetry. So if it's a broken symmetry, then the phonon is associated.

Wait, but I'm not sure about phonons. Because in a crystal, the translational symmetry is
