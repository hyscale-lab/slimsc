Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their observations in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. Hmm, I remember that in astronomy, the peak emission wavelength of an object can relate to its temperature via Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature, right? So peak λ = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant, around 2.9×10^-3 m·K.

So the quasar's peak is at 790 nm, which is 790 x 10^-9 meters, or 7.9e-7 m. Using Wien's Law, T would be about 2.9e-3 m·K divided by 7.9e-7 m. Let me calculate that: 2.9e-3 / 7.9e-7. Let's see, 2.9e-3 is 0.0029, divided by 7.9e-7 (0.00000079). So approximately 0.0029 / 0.00000079 ≈ 3670 K. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check the calculation. 2.9e-3 / 7.9e-7 = (2.9 /7.9) * 1e4 ≈ about 0.367 * 1e4 = 3670 K. Yeah, that seems about right.

But wait, quasars are supposed to be very hot, maybe even more than that. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the peak isn't the thermal emission but something else, but I think in this context it's about the blackbody spectrum.

So the quasar's temperature is about 3670 K. Now, how does that relate to the distance? Because the observed flux depends on the luminosity and the distance. The problem is about the comoving distance. Oh, right, so the redshift of the quasar would be important here.

Wait, but how do I connect the observed wavelength to redshift? Oh, right, because if the quasar is at a high redshift, the wavelength we observe is stretched due to the expansion of the
