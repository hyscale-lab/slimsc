Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a 1D infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for each particle is given by E_n = (n² * π² ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem says E = π² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E.

Wait, but these are four identical particles. Oh wait, identical particles that are spin-1/2 must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can have at most two particles because spin-1/2 has two possible states. So for each energy level n, we can have a maximum of two particles.

Alright, so the ground state is the lowest energy state. Let's think about how to fill the levels with four particles.

The energy levels in order are n=1, n=2, n=3, etc. Each n can have two particles. So let's fill them up.

Ground state: We have the lowest energy states filled first. So n=1 can hold two particles, and n=2 can hold another two. Wait, but four particles in total. So two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait no, because when you have identical fermions, each state is described by a quantum number n and a spin state. So each n can have two particles, each with opposite spins.

So for four particles, the filling would be:

n=1: 2 particles
n=2: 2 particles

Because n=1 is the lowest, then n=2.

Wait, but wait, that would mean the ground state has all four particles in n=1 and n=2. But that can't be right because the energy would be the sum of each particle's energy.

Each particle in n=1 has energy E, each in n=2 has 4E.

So two particles at E and two at 4E. So total energy would be 2 * E + 2 *4E = 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but for the ground state, the total energy is the sum of the individual energies.

Wait, for four particles, each in their lowest possible states.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused because each particle is in a separate state
