Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, molecular formula analysis time. So the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, so for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9+1? Wait, no, wait: (2*8=16, +2 is 18; 18 -9=9, minus 1 is 8, plus 1 (because N is treated as +1) is 9? Wait, maybe I should recalculate. So the formula is:

Degree of Unsaturation = (2*8 + 2 − 9 − 0 +1)/2 = (18−9+1)/2 = (10)/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be from a benzene ring (which is 3, assuming it's a mono-substituted benzene) and then some other double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR is provided as:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

So let's parse this. Starting with the highest ppm, 9.72 is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a strong signal, perhaps an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So that could be an aldehyde group.

Wait, but the triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Aldehyde protons typically don't have neighboring protons, as they're at the end. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton like a phenolic -OH, but those are usually broad singlets unless exchanging. Wait, but the integration is 1H. Another possibility is an enol proton, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone? No, ketone protons aren't usually that downfield. Wait, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. The aldehyde is conjugated, so maybe the proton is part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents that cause it to be a triplet.

Wait, another thought: maybe the triplet is an aromatic proton that's adjacent to two equivalent protons, leading to a triplet. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an aldehyde proton with coupling to two protons from a neighboring group, like a CH2 group. Wait, the aldehyde is RCHO. If the aldehyde is conjugated to a double bond, maybe the proton is coupled to the two protons
