Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these can get tricky. Let me take it step by step.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me parse the description again:

- The benzene has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, meta means each is separated by one carbon. So if I imagine the ring, these three groups are each at a position where two are meta to the third.

Wait, no. If all three are meta to one another, that might not be possible on a benzene ring. Because each pair would have to be meta. Let me think: in a benzene ring, each carbon is adjacent to two others. So if I have three substituents all meta to one another, their positions must be 1, 3, and 5, perhaps? Because each is two positions away from the others. Hmm.

But wait, the description says each substituent is meta to the others. So the carboxylic acid, the aldehyde, and the cyano group are each meta to each other. So their positions must be 1, 3, and 5 on the ring.

Wait, but let me think again. If a substituent is meta to another, it's two positions away. So if group A is at position 1, group B would be at position 3 (meta), and group C would be at position 5 (also meta to A and B). So yes, positions 1,3,5.

But wait, the problem also states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the groups ortho to it would be positions 2 and 6. So positions 2 and 6 have -OH and -N(CH3)2.

Additionally, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The para position is position 4. So position 4 has OMe.

Moreover, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. The nitrile is the cyano group, which is in one of the meta positions. Wait, the nitrile is one of the meta substituents along with the carboxylic acid and aldehyde.

Wait, let me map all substituents.

Let me try to assign positions.

Let me assume the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the other two meta substituents (aldehyde and cyano) would be at positions 3 and 5. But wait, the problem says the aldehyde is a substituent, and the cyano is another. So positions 1,3,5 have COOH, CHO, CN.

But wait, let me think: the aldehyde is a carbaldehyde, so that's a CHO group.

So substituent at position 1: COOH.

At positions 3 and 5: CHO and CN. But the problem doesn't specify which is where, so that might complicate things.

But let's proceed.

Carboxylic acid is at position 1.

Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are OH and N(CH3)2. Let's say position 2 is OH and position 6 is N(CH3)2. Or vice versa.

Para to COOH is position 4: OMe.

Additionally, the OMe and OH are both ortho to the nitrile. The nitrile is either at 3 or 5.

So nitrile is at position 3 or 5.

Wait, let's say nitrile is at position 3.

Then, the groups ortho to nitrile (positions 2 and 4) should be OMe and OH.

But position 2 is either OH or N(CH3)2, and position 4 is OMe.

Wait, so if nitrile is at 3, the ortho positions are 2 and 4. So for both OMe and OH to be ortho to the nitrile, position 2 must be OH and position 4 must be OMe. But position 4 is already OMe from the para position of COOH.

So that works: position 2: OH, position 4: OMe.

But wait, in that case, the nitrile is at 3. So the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

Wait, but the substituents at 5 and 3 are meta to COOH. So that's correct.

Alternatively, if the nitrile is at 5, then the ortho positions are 4 and 6. Since position 4 is OMe, then position 6 would have to be OH. But position 6 was assigned earlier as N(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a problem because position 6 can't be both.

Wait, so let's see.

If nitrile is at 5, its ortho positions are 4 and 6. Position 4 is OMe (from para to COOH), so position 6 would have to be OH. But position 6 was supposed to have N(CH3)2 because it's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6). So that's a conflict.

So that can't be right. Because position 6 can't have both N(CH3)2 and OH.

So, nitrile must be at position 3.

Then, the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

So now, let me check all the conditions.

- All three substituents (COOH, CHO, CN) are meta to each other.

COOH is at 1, CHO at 5, CN at 3. Are these all meta?

COOH(1) and CHO(5): positions 1 and 5 are separated by 4 positions (since 1 to 5 is 4 steps clockwise, but the meta is two positions away. Wait, wait, positions 1 and 5 are actually two positions apart if you go the other way. Because in a benzene ring, each substituent is in a hexagon. So between 1 and 5 is 4 positions if you go clockwise, but 2 if you go counter-clockwise. So 1 and 5 are two positions apart, which is meta.

Similarly, 1 and 3 are two positions apart (meta), and 3 and 5 are two positions apart (meta). So all three substituents are meta to each other. Good.

Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are OH and N(CH3)2. Yes, 2 is OH, 6 is N(CH3)2.

Para to COOH (position 4) is OMe. Yes.

And OMe (4) and OH (2) are both ortho to CN (3). Because position 3 has CN, so positions 2 and 4 are adjacent to it. So OH is at 2, OMe at 4, both ortho to CN.

That all fits.

Now, the substituents are:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)

2: OH

3: CN

4: OMe

5: CHO (carbaldehyde)

6: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)

So the numbering starts with the COOH as position 1.

In IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are numbered in such a way to give the lowest possible numbers. The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts from there.

Now, the substituents in order of priority (from highest to lowest):

1. Carboxylic acid (COOH) – highest priority.

2. Cyano group (CN)

3. Aldehyde (CHO)

4. Methoxy (OMe)

5. Hydroxyl (OH)

6. Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

Wait, but IUPAC priority is based on substituents. The order of functional groups by priority is:

- Carboxylic acid
- Aldehyde
- Cyano
- Methoxy
- Hydroxy (alcohol)
- Amine (dimethylamino)

Wait, wait, the substituent priorities are determined by the substituent’s seniority. According to IUPAC rules, the substituents are arranged in alphabetical order, but numbering starts to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, no. When numbering, you look for the substituents in the order of their priority to assign the lowest numbers.

The order of priority for substituents is determined by the order of functional groups. The functional groups are ranked based on their suffixes. For example, carboxylic acid has the highest priority, followed by aldehyde, then cyano, then others.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact order. Let me think. The order of seniority is as follows (from highest to lowest):

1. Carboxylic acid (-COOH)
2. Aldehyde (-CHO)
3. Cyano (-CN)
4. Methoxy (-OCH3)
5. Hydroxyl (-OH)
6. Amine (-N(CH3)2)

So when numbering the ring, the substituents with higher priority get lower numbers.

So the first substituent to assign a number is the carboxylic acid at position 1.

Next, we have the aldehyde at position 5, which is the next highest priority. Wait, no. Because the aldehyde has the second highest priority, so after COOH, it's next.

Wait, the numbering is chosen to give the substituent with the highest priority the lowest number possible. So, for the highest priority substituent, that's the COOH, which is already at 1.

Then, the next substituent is the aldehyde (CHO), which is at position 5. But wait, perhaps we can arrange the numbering to give a lower number to the aldehyde. Let me see.

Wait, the numbering starts with the COOH as position 1, so that's fixed. The aldehyde is at position 5. The cyano is at position 3. The other substituents are at 2 (OH), 4 (OMe), 6 (NMe2).

So the substituents in order of priority:

1. COOH (1)

2. CHO (5)

3. CN (3)

4. OMe (4)

5. OH (2)

6. NMe2 (6)

But wait, when numbering, if possible, we can choose a numbering direction that gives the substituents with higher priority lower numbers.

Wait, but the numbering is fixed once the principal substituent (COOH) is at position 1. So we can't change that. So the next substituent is CHO at position 5.

Wait, but let me think about the numbering. How do we arrange the substituents to have the lowest possible numbers?

Alternatively, perhaps I should number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of numbers in alphabetical order, considering their order of priority.

Wait, perhaps I should look at all substituents and their positions to see how the numbering would proceed.

But perhaps it's getting complicated. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid

So the substituents are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid

Positions 2,3,4,5,6.

Option C: 2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-4-methoxy-5-cyano-6-hydroxybenzoic acid.

So substituents at 2,3,4,5,6.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Hmm.

Wait, in our structure, the substituents are at 1 (COOH), 2 (OH), 3 (CN),4 (OMe),5 (CHO),6 (NMe2).

So, the substituents in order are:

COOH (1), CHO (5), CN (3), OMe (4), OH (2), NMe2 (6).

Wait, but when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, with the principal group first.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, with the principal group (benzoic acid) first, followed by the others in alphabetical order, except for the numbering based on their position.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: the numbering is based on substituents' positions, but the substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the name.

So, the substituents (excluding COOH) are:

CHO (formyl), CN (cyano), OMe (methoxy), OH (hydroxy), NMe2 (dimethylamino).

So, the alphabetical order is:

CHO (formyl), CN (cyano), methoxy, hydroxy, dimethylamino.

Wait, no. Let me list the substituents:

- Formyl (CHO)
- Cyano (CN)
- Methoxy (OMe)
- Hydroxy (OH)
- N,N-dimethylamino (NMe2).

So in alphabetical order:

- Cyano comes before formyl? No, wait, alphabetical order is based on the substituent name.

Wait, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their priority.

Wait, the substituents are listed in the name in alphabetical order, except when their position numbers can be minimized differently.

Wait, no, the order in the name is determined by the alphabetical order of the substituent names, except that the principal group comes first. So in this case, since it's a benzoic acid, that comes first. Then, the other substituents are ordered alphabetically.

So the substituents are:

Formyl, cyano, methoxy, hydroxy, dimethylamino.

Wait, looking at their names:

- Cyano (CN) comes before formyl (CHO) alphabetically because 'C' comes before 'F'.

Wait, 'C' comes before 'F', so 'cyano' comes before 'formyl'. Then comes 'hydroxy', 'methoxy', and 'dimethylamino'?

Wait, no. Let me list them alphabetically:

- Cyano (C)
- Dimethylamino (D)
- Formyl (F)
- Hydroxy (H)
- Methoxy (M)

Wait, no, because 'hydroxy' (H) comes after 'dimethylamino' (D). So the order would be:

1. Cyano
2. Dimethylamino
3. Formyl
4. Hydroxy
5. Methoxy

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think: the substituents are named alphabetically, so:

- 'C' comes first: cyano.
- 'D' comes next: dimethylamino.
- 'F' comes next: formyl.
- 'H' comes next: hydroxy.
- 'M' comes last: methoxy.

So in the name, the substituents are listed in this order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but the substituent positions might affect the numbering, but the substituent names are arranged alphabetically.

So, putting it all together, the name would start with "benzoic acid".

Then, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Now, each substituent is assigned a number based on their position relative to the COOH group.

Wait, the positions in our structure are:

COOH: 1

CHO: 5

CN: 3

OMe:4

OH:2

NMe2:6

So substituents:

CN at 3: '3-cyano'

CHO at 5: '5-formyl'

OMe at 4: '4-methoxy'

OH at 2: '2-hydroxy'

NMe2 at 6: '6-(dimethylamino)'

Wait, but in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so the order is cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

So:

3-cyano

6-(dimethylamino)

5-formyl

2-hydroxy

4-methoxy

So the name would be:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. That's exactly what I have here.

Option B is 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, let me check the substituents' order in Option A:

3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Yes, same as what we derived.

Option B’s substituents are in a different order, but since the name lists them in alphabetical order, which is cyano first, then dimethylamino, etc., Option A's order is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A.


The molecule is a benzene ring with the following substituents:

1. **Carboxylic acid (COOH)** at position 1 (principal functional group).  
2. **Aldehyde (CHO)** at position 5.  
3. **Cyano group (CN)** at position 3.  
4. **Methoxy group (OMe)** at position 4.  
5. **Hydroxyl group (OH)** at position 2.  
6. **Dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2)** at position 6.  

### Key Observations:
- The carboxylic acid (COOH) is the principal functional group, so the numbering starts at position 1.  
- The aldehyde (CHO), cyano group (CN), and carboxylic acid (COOH) are all meta to each other, confirming their positions at 1, 3, and 5.  
- Ortho to the carboxylic acid (positions 2 and 6) are the hydroxyl group (OH) and dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2).  
- Para to the carboxylic acid (position 4) is the methoxy group (OMe).  
- The methoxy group (OMe) and hydroxyl group (OH) are both ortho to the cyano group (CN), confirming the cyano group is at position 3.  

### Substituent Priorities and Alphabetical Order:
- Substituents are listed alphabetically in the IUPAC name, with the principal group (benzoic acid) first.  
- Alphabetical order of substituents: **cyano (CN)**, **dimethylamino (NMe2)**, **formyl (CHO)**, **hydroxy (OH)**, **methoxy (OMe)**.  

### Final Name:
The substituents are assigned numbers based on their positions relative to the carboxylic acid:
- **3-cyano**  
- **6-(dimethylamino)**  
- **5-formyl**  
- **2-hydroxy**  
- **4-methoxy**  

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Option Analysis:
- **Option A**: Matches the derived name.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect order of substituents.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect numbering and substituent order.  
- **Option D**: Incorrect numbering and substituent order.  

**Answer: A**
