Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question says.

So, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized, right? Because the state vector should have a norm of 1. Let me check: the components are -1, 2, and 1. The square of the magnitudes would be 1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2, which is 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the state isn't normalized yet. I think I need to normalize it before proceeding. So I'll have to divide each component by the square root of 6, which is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector ψ is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Next, we have two observables, P and Q. The operators for P and Q are given as matrices. I remember that observables correspond to Hermitian matrices, so I should probably verify if these are Hermitian. Let me check P first. The matrix for P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Transposing this matrix, the elements should be the same for it to be Hermitian. Wait, the (2,1) element is 1/sqrt(2), and the (1,2) is the same, so the transpose would match the original. But wait, what about the (3,2) element? The second row third element is 1/sqrt(2), and the third row second is 1/sqrt(2). So yes, P is Hermitian. Q's matrix is diagonal with 1, 0, -1 on the diagonal, so it's definitely Hermitian. So that's good.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. They ask for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the measurement of P affects the state before measuring Q. So first, I need to find the possible outcomes of P and the corresponding eigenstates, then see what the state becomes after measuring P=0, and then compute the probability of Q=-1 in that new state.

Wait, but maybe I should compute the probabilities step by step.

First, let's find the possible outcomes of P. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, I'll need to find its eigenvalues. Hmm, that could be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator or something else, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is in a specific form that makes finding eigenvalues easier.

Wait, looking at P's matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, considering the symmetry in the matrix. Let me think about the possible eigenvalues. Maybe it's a spin operator or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps P has eigenvalues 1 and -1, but I'm not certain. Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0.

So, the determinant of:

[-λ     1/sqrt(2)      0      ]

[1/sqrt(2)  -λ    1/sqrt(2) ]

[0      1/sqrt(2)   -λ      ]

Hmm, calculating this determinant. Let me write this out.

The matrix is
