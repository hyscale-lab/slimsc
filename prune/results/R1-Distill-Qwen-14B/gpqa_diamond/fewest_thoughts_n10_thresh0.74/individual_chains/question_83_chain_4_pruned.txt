Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm. So I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the concentration decreases, which would make it less strong. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, its dissociation is minimal. But when you add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid, neutralizing it and forming acetate ions.

Let me break this down into steps.

First, the initial solution after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³.

Wait, wait. So the initial moles of acetic acid would be Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 L) equals 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

After dilution, the concentration becomes 0.001 moles / 0.04 L (40 cm³) = 0.025 M. So the concentration is 0.025 M. But wait, wait. No, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 0.05 M is 0.05 mol/L. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then when you add 20 cm³, the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So concentration is 0.001 /0.04 = 0.025 M. Oh, I made that correctly.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. Let me think about the titration process.

The volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point can be determined. Let's see. The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol (from earlier). So moles of NaOH needed are 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 =
