Okay, so I've got this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I remember that when atoms are more excited, that has something to do with higher energy levels. Oh right, it's about their energy states.

So the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. Oh right, in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), which the problem states, the distribution should follow this.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the specific energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. I think that means the population in the excited state is higher for star_1. Let's say the ground state is j and the excited state is i. So for star_1, n_i1 / n_j1 = something, and for star_2, n_i2 / n_j2 = something else.

Wait, but the question states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. Maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_i1/n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2). Or perhaps n_i1 = 2 * n_i2, but I'm not entirely sure about that wording. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the excitation is twice as much, so the ratio is higher. Let's think. Letâ€™s denote the excitation as being the population in the higher energy level. So for star_1, the ratio n_i/n_j is higher. So the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or is it that the excitation potential (the energy difference) is the same, but the temperatures are different, leading to different populations?

Wait, the problem says the energy difference is the same, 1.38e-2
