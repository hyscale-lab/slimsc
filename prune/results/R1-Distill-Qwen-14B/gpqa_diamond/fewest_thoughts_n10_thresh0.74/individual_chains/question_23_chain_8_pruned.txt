Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. Then, after some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, meaning the reaction was proceeding, and two new spots appeared. So, I need to figure out which products are formed from this reaction.

Hmm. The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me draw its structure. So, the benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's oxygen is connected to a but-3-en-1-yl group. The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but wait, the substituents are on the but-3-en-1-yl group.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... No, wait, let me think. The structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, but butane is four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The substituents are on the but-3-en-1-yl group. So, the substituents are at position 3. Wait, the correct structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... No, wait, the actual structure is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. So, the but-3-en-1-yl group
