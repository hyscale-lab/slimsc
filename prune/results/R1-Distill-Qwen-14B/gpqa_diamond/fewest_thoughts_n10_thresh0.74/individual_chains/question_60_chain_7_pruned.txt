Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs because of relativity. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, so I need to think carefully.

The question involves an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth. Their spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to find out how long the trip takes from their point of view. Also, the aliens have an average lifetime of about 150 solar years. Oh right, so if the trip takes too long from their perspective, they might not live long enough.

Wait, but wait. From the astronaut's perspective, the trip duration is what we're looking for. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the astronaut's frame.

Time dilation in special relativity is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is gamma equals 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, v is a significant fraction of c here, so we need to compute that.

The speed given is 0.99999987*c. Let me square that. Let's write v = 0.99999987 c. So, v^2 = (0.99999
