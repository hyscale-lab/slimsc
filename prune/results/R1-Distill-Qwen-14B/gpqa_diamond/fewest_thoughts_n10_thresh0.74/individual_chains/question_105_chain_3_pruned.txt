Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star from Earth, its brightness will vary as it rotates—this is called rotational modulation. The interesting part is that this setup can look similar to the presence of an exoplanet when looking at the light curve. The question is asking, what's the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted otherwise.

Hmm, so first, I need to recall how the brightness variations work in both cases—spots on a star and a planet transiting in front of it.

When a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The amount blocked depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula I remember is that the change in brightness (delta F) is proportional to (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, in this problem, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the total brightness of the star decreases. The brightness change depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference from the rest of the star.

Let me think. The star's total brightness without spots would be based on its surface area and temperature. When spots are present, they contribute less. The effective brightness of the star is the sum of the unspotted areas and the spotted areas.

The filling factor is given as 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since it's one hemisphere, the total spotted area is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. But wait, the hemisphere is half the star's surface, so the total area of spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar^2 / 2) ) = 0.1 π Rstar^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it differently. The filling factor (f) is the fraction of the surface covered
