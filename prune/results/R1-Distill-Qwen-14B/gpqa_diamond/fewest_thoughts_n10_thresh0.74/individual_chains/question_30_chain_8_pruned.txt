Okay, so I've got this question here about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I remember that when a substance emits light, it's because the electrons have transitioned from a higher energy state to a lower one, releasing energy in the form of light. But wait, the question is about the absorbed light, not the emitted. Oh right! Because the emitted light is usually the complementary color of what's absorbed. Or is it the other way around? I get confused sometimes.

So, I think the process goes like this: when a molecule absorbs certain wavelengths of light, its electrons get excited to higher energy levels. The energy of that absorbed light determines the color we see as the compound's absorbed color. But wait, no, wait. The compound's color is actually the color of the light it reflects or transmits, which is the complement of the absorbed color. So if a compound absorbs blue light, it might appear orange because blue and orange are complements.

But let me get back to the question. The dye emits 2.3393 eV. I remember that energy and wavelength are related by the equation E = hc/Î». So if I can find the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV, I can figure out the color.

Wait, but wait again. The energy emitted is from the molecule when it drops back to a lower energy state. But the question is about the absorbed light
