Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process: γγ → e+ e-. And the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so we're talking about pretty high-energy gamma rays.

I remember that the interaction of high-energy particles with the CMB is a significant factor in their propagation through the universe. The process here is pair production, where two photons collide and produce an electron-positron pair. This process would limit the lifetime of the gamma rays because once they annihilate, they can't travel further, so their effective lifetime is determined by how quickly they can annihilate.

Now, the key formula here is probably the photon-photon interaction cross-section and the relation to the energy involved. I think the cross-section depends on the energies of the two photons. Since the CMB photons are at low energy (1e-3 eV), one of the photons is high energy (gamma) and the other is low energy (CMB).

The cross-section for γγ → e+ e- goes up with the energy, but how exactly? I think the cross-section has a certain dependence on the center-of-mass energy. The process happens when the combined energy of the two photons is enough to produce the electron and positron. So the center-of-mass energy (s) must be at least 2m_e c², where m_e is the electron mass.

Wait, the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, right? So 2m_e is about 1.022 MeV. So when the center-of-mass energy is higher than this, the pair production can occur.

But wait, the CMB photon is much lower energy. So the high-energy gamma photon (E) and low-energy CMB photon (E_cmb) interact. The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E + E_cmb)^2 - (p + p_cmb)^2 c^2. But since photons are massless, their energy is |p| c. So for photons moving in opposite directions (assuming they collide head-on), the momentum terms would subtract. So s = (E + E_cmb)^2 - (E - E_cmb)^2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the CMB photon is moving in some direction, and the gamma is moving opposite. So their momenta are in opposite directions, so when you calculate s, it's (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2. Because p is in opposite directions, so the vector sum is p1 - p2.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 c^2 / c^2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write this properly.

The center of mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Wait, no, because for photons, E = |p| c. So
