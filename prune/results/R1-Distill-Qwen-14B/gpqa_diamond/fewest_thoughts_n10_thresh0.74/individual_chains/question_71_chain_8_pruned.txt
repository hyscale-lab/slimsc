Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question says there are five planets in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method, but I think that's just how they were discovered, so probably not relevant here. 

They want the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't come into play in the calculation. Equilibrium temperature usually depends on the distance from the star, right? 

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, the exact formula I remember is T = T_eff * (L / (16πσ a²))^1/4, but another way to think about it is that the temperature scales with the square root of (L/(a²)), but I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, considering the inverse square law, the flux drops with the square of the distance, so the temperature (which relates to the fourth root of flux, since it's about energy balance) would drop with the square root of the distance. 

Wait, let me think again. The equilibrium temperature T is given by the formula:

T = T_earth * (P_planet / P_earth)^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4) * (distance_factor)

But wait, another approach: the formula I remember is T = T_star * ( (1 - abedo) / ( (1 + e) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) )^(1/4) * ( (1 AU) / a )^(1/2) ), but since all these planets have circular orbits, e is zero, so the term simplifies. Also, albedos are the same, so that term is the same for all planets. So the ratio will depend only on their distances.

Wait, but wait, the planets are in orbital resonance, and the periods are given in a ratio. So their orbital periods are P1, 2P1, 2.5P1, 3.5P1, 5P1.

Since orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law: P² ∝ a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). Because for Kepler's law, P² = (4π²/GM) a³, so a = ( (G M P²) / (4 π²) )^(1/3) → a ∝ P^(2/3). 

So if I can find the ratio of a4 to a2, I can find the ratio of their distances, and then apply it to the equilibrium temperature.

Equilibrium temperature formula: T ∝ ( L / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4) → T ∝ sqrt( (L)^(1/2) / a² )^(1/2) → Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of T proportional to sqrt( L / a² ), but considering the inverse square for flux and the fourth root for temperature. Let me get this straight.

Wait, the flux from the star at distance
