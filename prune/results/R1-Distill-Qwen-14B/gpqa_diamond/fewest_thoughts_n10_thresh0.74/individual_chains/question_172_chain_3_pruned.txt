Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, the ratio of their populations in that level is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the way it's phrased, "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited," I think it means that the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, n1 = 2 n2.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, wait, that's a familiar number. 1.38 is approximately Boltzmann's constant k multiplied by something. Let me think, k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh right! So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k * T for some temperature T when ΔE = k T. But wait, not exactly. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so the ratio of populations is given by that.

The Boltzmann equation is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Here, n2 is the higher energy level. Wait, wait, let me get the exact formula. I think it's n_upper / n_lower = exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ). So, if star_1 has more excited atoms, then perhaps n_upper for star_1 is higher than for star_2.

Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 times (n2_upper / n2_lower). Or maybe the ratio between the two stars is n1_upper / n2_upper = 2? Or wait, no, perhaps the ratio of excitation in star_1 to star_2 is 2. So, (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) divided by (n2_upper)/(n2_lower
