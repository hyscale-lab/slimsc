Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine concerning resistance to anthracnose. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step. I remember that when dealing with knockout mutants and their phenotypes, especially in terms of disease resistance, considering epistasis and gene interactions is key.

The question gives data on the resistance levels of various mutants, so I'll need to analyze that to figure out the relationships between G1, G2, and G3. The setup is that each gene is knocked out, and also some double knockouts are tested. The results are in percentages compared to the wild type, which is 100% resistant.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half as resistant)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
- g1g2: 0% (same as g2)

Wait, the problem also says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So that means it's regulating other genes. Transcription factors usually work in pathways, activating or repressing other genes.

Let me think about what each of these results implies.

First, the single mutants:

- g2: 0% resistance. That's a big hit. So without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So G2 might be a key gene, perhaps the transcription factor since it's acting upstream. If knocking it out completely eliminates resistance, that suggests that G2 is essential for the resistance pathway.

- g1: 75% resistance. So the plants are less resistant but not completely susceptible. Maybe G1 contributes to the pathway but isn't the only component. So maybe G1 is part of a redundant system or works in parallel?

- g3: 50% resistance. So it's even more susceptible than g1. But not as bad as g2.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. Hmm, if both g1 and g2 are knocked out, the resistance is zero. But wait, g2 alone is already 0%. What does that mean? Well, if a double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, it suggests that one gene is epistatic over the other. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So in this case, G2 is epistatic to G1 because the double mutant g1g2 is as bad as g2. That implies that G2 is downstream of G1. Or wait, no—if G2 is epistatic to G1, then the pathway is G1 → G2 → ... So if G2 is knocked out, it doesn't matter if G1 is present; the pathway is blocked anyway.

Similarly, g2g3: 0% resistance. Again, g2 alone is 0%, so
