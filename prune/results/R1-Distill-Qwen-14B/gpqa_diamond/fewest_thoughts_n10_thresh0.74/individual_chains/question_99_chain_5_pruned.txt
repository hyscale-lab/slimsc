Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, and I need to pick the right one based on the spectroscopic information provided.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group because, in carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is very broad, and the carbonyl is around 1700. Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but the broad peak is more characteristic of a carboxylic acid. Let me check the options for which ones have a COOH group.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ends with CH2COOH. So, that's a carboxylic acid.

Option B: Ends with COOH, same here.

Option C: Ends with CH2COOH, another carboxylic acid.

Option D: Ends with COOH as well.

So all options have a COOH group except perhaps I should check. Wait, no, all four options end with either COOH or CH2COOH, which are both carboxylic acids. So the O-H is definitely there.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. That means there are no double bonds in the structure, or the double bonds don't have adjacent hydrogens. So the molecule is probably saturated, not containing any alkenes or maybe the protons on any double bonds are not present, perhaps they're in a trans configuration or not split into a multiplet. Alternatively, the molecule is entirely single bonds. Let me see the structures for any possibility of double bonds.

Wait, looking at the structures, none of the options have double bonds. They all seem to be alkanes with a COOH group attached. So the absence of vinyl hydrogens makes sense because there's no double bond in any of them. So that part doesn't help me narrow it down much.

Next, looking at the NMR splitting patterns. One of the signals is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about what kind of splitting that could arise from.

Splitting in NMR occurs due to neighboring (vicinal) protons. Each neighboring H will split the peak into a multiplet. The number of splits is 2n+1, where n is the number of neighboring protons. However, when there are multiple neighboring groups with different numbers of protons, the splitting becomes more complex, leading to patterns like doublet of doublets, triplet of doublets, etc.

Let me try to imagine each option's structure and their expected NMR signals.

Option A: Structure is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, the central part is C(H)(C2H5) connected to another C(H)(C2H5), and then a CH2 connected to COOH. So the molecule is something like CH2(C)(C)-CH2-COOH. The central carbons each have a CH group attached to two ethyl groups. Let me draw it mentally: the central part is a geminal di-ethyl group? No, wait. The structure is more like a cyclohexane derivative, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, each of the two central carbons (C(H)(C2H5)) is attached to another, so the structure
