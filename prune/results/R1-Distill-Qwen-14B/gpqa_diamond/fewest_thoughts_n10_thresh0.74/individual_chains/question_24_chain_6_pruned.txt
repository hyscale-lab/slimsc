Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about equimolar mixtures and some reactions. I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the first part says that mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. I remember that substances that decolorize bromine water are usually those with unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes. They can undergo addition reactions with bromine, hence removing the color.

So, X has two liquids that can decolorize bromine. They must be unsaturated. Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids resulting from a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. So, maybe one of the components in X is undergoing this.

Wait, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That's interesting. So, whatever happened to X made Y less reactive towards bromine. Maybe the unsaturated bonds were hydrogenated or something else happened.

Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. This Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let's calculate that. Hydrogen's molar mass is about 1, so 14.28% means for every 100g, 14.28g is H. That would be 14.28 / 1 = 14.28 moles of H per 100g. Wait, but the molar mass of Z is (100g - 14.28g H) = 85.72g from C. Wait, carbon is 12 g/mol, hydrogen 1. So for 100g, the formula would be C8H18? Wait, wait, let's compute that correctly.

Wait, let's compute the molecular formula of Z. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, so C is 85.72%. Let's denote the formula as CnHm.

Total mass is 100g, so 85.72g C is 85.72 /12 = approx 7.143 moles of C. H is 14.28 /1 = 14.28 moles of H.

Since the ratio is n:m = 7.143 :14.28. Let's see, 7.143 is approximately 10/14 (wait, 7.143 is 50/7, which is about 7.14). Alternatively, 7.143 * 2 = 14.286, which is about 14.28. So the ratio is 1 : 2. So the formula might be C5H10? Wait, wait:

Wait, if 7.143 is C and 14.28 is H, 7.143 * 2 =14.286, which is approximately equal to H's moles. So the ratio is 1:2. So the formula is CnH2n. Wait, but 14.28 is 14.28 moles of H, which from 100g, but wait, let's think again.

Wait, no, the mass percentages are 85.72% C and 14.28% H. So:

C: 85.72% /12 g/mol ≈7.143 mol
H:14.28% /1=14.28 mol

So the ratio is C:H = 7.143 :14.28 → simplifying, divide both by 7.143 → 1 : 2. So the formula is CH2, but that can
