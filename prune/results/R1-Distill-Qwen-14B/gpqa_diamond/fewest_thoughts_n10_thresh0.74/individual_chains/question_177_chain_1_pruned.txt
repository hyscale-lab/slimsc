Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says we're comparing two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—so Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so they scale up similarly in radius and mass. But the main point is about their luminosities.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths where they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission (like the blackbody spectrum) depends on its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature T of the star. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Now, the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. So the luminosity formula comes into play here. Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same temperature T, the luminosity ratio L1/L2 will depend on the ratio of their radii squared. Let me write that out:

L1 / L2 = (R1² * T1⁴) / (R2² * T2⁴)

But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So it's (R1²)/(R2²). R1 is 1.5 R2, so substituting:

( (1.5 R2)² ) / R2² = (2.25 R2²) / R2² = 2.25.

Wait, but that's straightforward. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, the question says they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor of which option? So 2.25 is option A.

But wait
