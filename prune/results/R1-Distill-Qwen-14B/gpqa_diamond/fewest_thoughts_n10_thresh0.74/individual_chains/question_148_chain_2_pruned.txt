Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five of them. Then there are several substances A1 to A5, each with certain properties. I need to figure out the molecular weight of A4 and choose the correct range from the options given.

Let me break down the information provided.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. When A1 decomposes, one of the products is fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing xenon... Xenon is a noble gas, so it must be acting as a reducing agent here. So A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Next, A2 has an oF (oxidation state of fluorine?) of 31.96%. Wait, wait, oF usually stands for the oxidation number or maybe the percentage composition. Oh, wait, the question probably means the oxidation state of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, that's confusing because oxidation states are numbers, not percentages. Maybe it refers to fluorine's percentage by mass in A2? Or perhaps the oxidation state as a value? Or maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in the compound. Let me think. For example, if fluorine is in a certain oxidation state, like F- in a compound, what would that mean?

Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%". The "ɷ" might be a typo or a symbol I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's supposed to be "OF" or "O.F." which could stand for oxidation number or oxidation state. Alternatively, maybe it's oxygen-free or something. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's the percentage composition of fluorine in A2. So, if A2 is a binary compound of fluorine and Y, and the fluorine content is 31.96% by mass, that could be a clue.

Wait, let me think. The problem states that all A1 to A5 are binary compounds of fluorine and Y. So each is YF_x where x is some number.

So A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the reaction is something like A1 → A2 + F2. Since it's a decomposition, perhaps the fluorine is being released. So maybe A1 is a more complex compound, like a higher fluoride, and when it decomposes, it produces a lower one plus F2. Also, A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, so it's likely in a high oxidation state.

Wait, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is typically in the 0 oxidation state, so if A1 oxidizes it, A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent, meaning it's in a high oxidation state. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state.

Wait, let's think about fluorine compounds. Fluorine is typically in the -1 oxidation state. So for a binary compound YF_x, Y would be in a +
