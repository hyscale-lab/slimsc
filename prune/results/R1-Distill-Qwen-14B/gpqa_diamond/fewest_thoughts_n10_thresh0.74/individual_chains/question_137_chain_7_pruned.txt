Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. Cyclotrons use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles in a circular path. Synchrocyclotrons are similar but they can vary the magnetic field over time, I think, which allows for higher energies.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T≈0. It goes through two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U₀ cos[2πν(α)t + Φ₀]. The data given is Φ₀ = π/4 and U₀=190 kV. We need to find how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact working of a synchrocyclotron. Let me think. In a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is constant because the magnetic field is constant. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field changes with time, which affects the revolution time.

When a proton is accelerated in such a machine, each time it goes around the orbit, it's accelerated by the electric field. The frequency of the applied voltage must match the proton's orbit frequency for effective acceleration—this is called resonance.

But wait, the problem gives the voltage as a function of time with a cosine dependence. So the electric field is oscillating. The key here might be to relate the time taken to reach the desired energy to the number of revolutions.

The initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the proton starts from rest. As it accelerates, it gains energy in each pass through the electric field. Each time it goes around, it gains a certain amount of energy.

Wait, but how much energy does it gain each revolution? I'm trying to recall the formula for the energy gain in each step. In a cyclotron, the energy gained per revolution is e * U₀, assuming the voltage is effective each time. But wait, in a cyclotron, the accelerating voltage is such that the particle is accelerated twice per revolution because the electric field alternates direction. Oh, right, so the energy gain per revolution is actually e * U₀, because each half-cycle (each 180 degree turn) provides a kick. Wait no, let's think again.

In a cyclotron, the particles go through the gaps between the D-shaped electrodes. Each time they cross the gap, which is in a particular direction, the electric field accelerates them. Since the field alternates direction each half-period, the proton gets a kick each time it passes through the gap. So in each full revolution, the proton would experience two acceleration events. So each revolution gives a total energy gain of 2eU₀? Or maybe eU₀ per half-revolution? Wait, perhaps each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains eU₀. But how often does that happen?

Wait, perhaps for each revolution, the particle passes through the gap twice, so each revolution contributes 2 * e * U₀ to the energy. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy per revolution is e * U₀. Let me get this straight.

In a cyclotron, the electric field is
