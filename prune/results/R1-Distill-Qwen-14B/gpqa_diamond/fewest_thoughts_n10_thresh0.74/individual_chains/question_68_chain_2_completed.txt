Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, so the problem is about a spin-1/2 particle. Its magnetic moment mu is given by gamma times Sz, and it's aligned with a magnetic field pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment when this change happens.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, when a particle's spin is in a magnetic field, the energy levels are quantized. The magnetic moment interacts with the field, leading to energy levels proportional to the spin component along the field direction.

So initially, the field is along +Z. The spin is aligned with this field, so the magnetic moment mu is in the +Z direction. The spin state is probably in the eigenstate of Sz, which for spin-1/2 would be either up or down. But wait, the problem says it's aligned with the field. So if the field is along +Z, the particle's spin is in the +Z eigenstate. That means the state is |+z>, with Sz = ħ/2 (since for spin 1/2, S_z can be ±ħ/2).

But then the field is switched off and turned on along +Y. Now the magnetic field is in the Y direction. The new Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y. So the system will start evolving under this new Hamiltonian.

Wait, the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. But in this case, the magnetic moment is given as μ = gamma * S_z. Wait, wait, the problem says mu is gamma times S_z. So the magnetic moment is μ = γ S_z. So the interaction energy is H = -μ·B. But when the field is along +Z, it's H = -γ S_z B, right? Because the dot product simplifies to just the component in the direction of B.

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The interaction energy is H = -μ·B. So if B is in the Z direction, then H = -μ_z B. And μ_z is γ S_z. So H = -γ S_z B.

But wait in the initial state, the field is on, so the particle is in an eigenstate of H. When the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero. Then, the field is turned on along +Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H' = -μ·B', where B' is along Y. So H' = -μ_y B. But wait, μ is given as gamma S_z. So μ_y would be the y-component of S, multiplied by gamma.

Wait, no. Because μ is a vector, so each component is γ times the corresponding S component. So μ_x = γ S_x, μ_y = γ S_y, μ_z = γ S_z.

Ah, so H' is - (μ · B') = - (γ S · B') where B' is along Y. So for B' along Y, H' becomes -γ B S_y. So H' = - γ B S_y.

But wait, the problem states that both fields have the same magnitude B. So the initial B was along Z, then switched to B along Y, same B magnitude.

So the new Hamiltonian is H' = - γ B S_y.

Wait, but the initial state was an eigenstate of S_z. So when the field is switched on in the Y direction, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve over time, and we'll observe oscillations in the expectation value of S_z.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average (expectation value) of the z-component of the particle’s moment. So we need to find ⟨Sz⟩ as a function of time.

In quantum mechanics, when a system is in a state that is a superposition of energy eigenstates, the expectation values of observables can oscillate with frequencies determined by the energy differences.

So the initial state is |ψ(0)⟩ = |+z⟩, which is an eigenstate of S_z. After the field is switched on, the time evolution is governed by the new Hamiltonian H' = -γ B S_y.

Since H' depends on S_y, the eigenstates of H' are the eigenstates of S_y. The initial state |+z⟩ can be expressed as a superposition of these eigenstates.

To find the time evolution, we can write |ψ(0)⟩ in terms of the eigenstates of H', then each component will evolve with a phase factor based on their energy.

Let me recall that the eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

Expressing |+z⟩ in terms of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

I know that |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ can be written in terms of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩. The standard transformation is:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩) / sqrt(2)
|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - |-z⟩) / sqrt(2)

Wait no, wait. Let me think. The states |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ are linear combinations of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩.

More accurately, since S_y is Hermitian, its eigenstates are orthogonal. The eigenstates can be written as:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + e^{i φ} |-z⟩) / sqrt(2)
Similarly for |-y⟩.

But what is the phase factor φ? For the standard spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates of S_y are often written as:

|+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩) / sqrt(2)
|-y⟩ = (|+z⟩ - |-z⟩) / sqrt(2)

Wait, no, that can't be right because they're not orthogonal. Let me compute the inner product of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩ as defined above.

⟨+y | -y⟩ = [1/sqrt(2)]^2 [ ⟨+z| + ⟨-z| ] [ |+z⟩ - |-z⟩ ]

Which is (1/2) [ 1 -1 +0 +0 ] = (1/2)(0) = 0. So yes, they are orthogonal. So the correct expressions are:

|+y⟩ = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)
|-y⟩ = 1/sqrt(2) (|+z⟩ - |-z⟩)

Wait, wait, actually, perhaps the phase is different. Let me think about the actual rotation. I remember that a spin state in the y-direction can be obtained by rotating a spin in the z-direction by 90 degrees around the x-axis. So the rotation from z to y involves a rotation of 90 degrees. Let me think about the rotation matrices.

The rotation operator around the x-axis by θ is R_x(θ) = exp(-i S_x θ / ħ ). For θ=π/2, R_x(π/2) would rotate the state |+z⟩ into a combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

But perhaps I should look for the actual expansion. Another approach is to note that the eigenstates of S_y are:

|+y⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩) / sqrt(2)  in some notation.

Wait, but in terms of spin-up and spin-down along z, which are |+z⟩ and |-z⟩.

So, |+y⟩ can be expressed as (|+z⟩ + e^{i φ} |-z⟩) / sqrt(2), but I need to determine φ.

The eigenstates of S_y are such that S_y |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩.

Expressing |+y⟩ as a linear combination of |+z⟩ and |-z⟩, say |+y⟩ = a|+z⟩ + b|−z⟩.

Then, S_y |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) |+y⟩.

But S_y |+z⟩ = (iħ/2)|−z⟩ and S_y |−z⟩ = (−i ħ/2)|+z⟩.

So, let me compute S_y (a|+z⟩ + b|−z⟩) = a S_y |+z⟩ + b S_y |−z⟩ = a (iħ/2)|−z⟩ + b (−i ħ/2)|+z⟩.

This must equal (ħ/2)(a|+z⟩ + b|−z⟩).

So, equating components:

Coefficient of |+z⟩: -i b (ħ/2) = (ħ/2) a → -i b = a.

Coefficient of |−z⟩: i a (ħ/2) = (ħ/2) b → i a = b.

So we have two equations: 

From the |+z⟩ component: -i b = a.

From the |−z⟩ component: i a = b.

Let's substitute a from the first equation into the second. a = -i b.

Substituting into the second equation: i (-i b) = b → ( -i^2 ) b = b → ( - (-1) ) b = b → (1) b = b. So the equation is satisfied.

So, a = -i b.

Let me choose b=1 (for normalization). Then a = -i.

So |+y⟩ = (-i |+z⟩ + |−z⟩)/sqrt(2) ?

Wait, but that would give |+y⟩ = (|−z⟩ − i |+z⟩)/sqrt(2). Hmm, but the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2) since |a|^2 + |b|^2 must be 1. | -i |^2 =1, |1|^2=1, so total (1+1)/2=1, correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought |+y⟩ was (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)/sqrt(2), but that's not correct. Because if I compute S_y for that state, maybe it gives the right eigenvalue.

Wait, let me recompute. Suppose |+y⟩ = (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)/sqrt(2).

Then, S_y |+y⟩ = S_y (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)/sqrt(2) = [ (iħ/2)|−z⟩ + (−i ħ/2)|+z⟩ ] / sqrt(2).

Which is [ (i |−z⟩ - i |+z⟩ ) ħ/2 ] / sqrt(2) = i ( |−z⟩ - |+z⟩ ) (ħ/2) / sqrt(2).

The eigenvalue would be (ħ/2) times something. Let me factor out (ħ/2):

S_y |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) [ i ( |−z⟩ - |+z⟩ ) ] / sqrt(2).

But for this to be equal to (ħ/2)|+y⟩, the term inside the brackets must equal |+y⟩.

Wait, |+y⟩ is (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)/sqrt(2), but the term here is (|−z⟩ - |+z⟩)/sqrt(2) multiplied by i.

So (i)(|−z⟩ - |+z⟩)/sqrt(2) = i ( (-1)( |+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ) ) / sqrt(2) ) → (-i) ( |+z⟩ - |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Hmm, which is -i |+y⟩ as |+y⟩ is (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)/sqrt(2)? Wait, no, wait. No, |+y⟩ is (|+z⟩ + |-z⟩)/sqrt(2). So I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the correct expansion. So from the earlier calculation, |+y⟩ = (−i |+z⟩ + |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

But wait, that can't be right because the eigenvalue equation wasn't satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled here. Let me instead think about the spin matrices. For spin-1/2, S_x, S_y, S_z are represented by Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

The eigenstates for S_y would be the eigenvectors of the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The eigenvectors can be found by solving (σ_y - λ I) |v⟩ = 0.

The eigenvalues are λ = ±1. For λ=1:

[[ -1, -i ], [i, -1 ]] |v⟩ =0 → -v1 -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to ( -i, 1 ), which can be written as (0 - i, 1) scaled. So the state is ( -i, 1 ) / sqrt(2).

In terms of spin-up and spin-down along z (which correspond to (1, 0) and (0,1)), this state is ( -i |+z⟩ + |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -1, the eigenvector is ( i, 1 ) / sqrt(2), which is (i |+z⟩ + |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2).

So, the eigenstates are:

|+y⟩ = ( -i |+z⟩ + |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)
|-y⟩ = ( i |+z⟩ + |−z⟩ ) / sqrt(2)

Wait, but wait, when I compute S_y |+y⟩, let me see:

S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y> 

So, using |+y> = ( -i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2).

Then, S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) [ (i |−z> ) (from S_y |+z> ) + ( -i |+z> ) (from S_y |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2).

Wait, no.

Wait, S_y |+z> = (ħ/2) (i |−z> )

S_y |−z> = (ħ/2) ( -i |+z> )

So, S_y |+y> = (1/sqrt(2)) [ S_y |+z> + S_y |−z> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) [ (i |−z> ) (ħ/2) + ( -i |+z> ) (ħ/2) ) ]

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2)(1/sqrt(2)) [ i |−z> - i |+z> ]

= (i ħ/2)( |−z> - |+z> ) / sqrt(2 )

= (i ħ/2) ( - ( |+z> - |−z> ) ) / sqrt(2 )

= ( -i ħ/2 ) ( |+z> - |−z> ) / sqrt(2 )

But |+z> - |−z> is proportional to |+y>?

Wait, no. Because |+y> is ( -i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2 ), which is the same as ( |−z> - i |+z> ) / sqrt(2 ).

Wait, perhaps I can factor this.

Hmm, perhaps it's getting too involved. Let me just proceed with the expansion.

The initial state is |+z⟩. So |+z> can be expressed as a combination of |+y⟩ and |-y⟩.

So, |+z> = a |+y> + b |-y>.

We can solve for a and b.

Using the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:

|+y> = ( -i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2 )

|-y> = ( i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2 )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

Let me write |+z> = c |+y> + d |-y>.

Substituting the expressions for |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = c [ (-i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ] + d [ (i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ]

Grouping the terms:

|+z> = [ (-i c + i d ) |+z> + (c + d ) |−z> ] / sqrt(2 )

Since |+z> and |−z> are orthonormal, their coefficients must match on both sides.

Left-hand side: coefficient of |+z> is 1, coefficient of |−z> is 0.

So,

( -i c + i d ) / sqrt(2 ) = 1
( c + d ) / sqrt(2 ) = 0

We have two equations:

1. ( -i c + i d ) = sqrt(2 )

2. ( c + d ) = 0

From equation 2, d = -c.

Substituting into equation 1:

-i c + i (-c) = sqrt(2 )

→ -i c - i c = sqrt(2 )

→ -2i c = sqrt(2 )

→ c = sqrt(2 ) / (-2i )

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

c = sqrt(2 ) * i / ( -2i^2 ) → since i^2 = -1,

c = sqrt(2 ) * i / (2 )

→ c = i sqrt(2)/2

Then, d = -c → d = -i sqrt(2)/2

So,

|+z> = (i sqrt(2)/2 ) |+y> + ( -i sqrt(2)/2 ) |-y> 

Factor out sqrt(2)/2:

|+z> = ( sqrt(2)/2 ) [ i |+y> - i |-y> ]

= (i sqrt(2)/2) ( |+y> - |-y> )

Alternatively, perhaps it's more convenient to write:

|+z> = ( |+y> + e^{i π/2} |-y> ) / sqrt(2 )

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to proceed with the coefficients I found.

So, the initial state is |+z> = (i sqrt(2)/2) |+y> - (i sqrt(2)/2) |-y> 

So, |ψ(0)> = |+z> = [ i |+y> - i |-y> ] / sqrt(2 )

Now, the time evolution is governed by H' = - γ B S_y.

The energy eigenvalues for H' are:

H' |+y> = - γ B (ħ/2 ) |+y>
H' |-y> = γ B (ħ/2 ) |-y>

Wait, because S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H' |+y> = -γ B (ħ/2) |+y>
Similarly, H' |-y> = γ B (ħ/2) |-y>

So, the time evolution of each component is given by a phase factor e^(-i E t / ħ )

So, the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = (i |+y> [ e^{-i E_+ t / ħ } ] ) / sqrt(2)  + ( -i |-y> [ e^{-i E_- t / ħ } ] ) / sqrt(2 )

Where E_+ = - γ B (ħ/2 ), and E_- = γ B (ħ/2 )

Wait, wait. Because H' |+y> = E_+ |+y>, so E_+ is (- γ B)(ħ/2 )

Similarly, E_- = (+ γ B)(ħ/2 )

So,

|ψ(t)> = [i e^{-i E_+ t / ħ } |+y> - i e^{-i E_- t / ħ } |-y> ] / sqrt(2 )

Substituting E_+ and E_-:

E_+ = - ( γ B ħ ) / 2 → E_+ t / ħ = - ( γ B t ) / 2

So, e^{-i E_+ t / ħ } = e^{ i ( γ B t ) / 2 }

Similarly, E_- = ( γ B ħ ) / 2 → E_- t / ħ = ( γ B t ) / 2

e^{-i E_- t / ħ } = e^{ -i ( γ B t ) / 2 }

So:

|ψ(t)> = [ i e^{i (γ B t/2)} |+y> - i e^{ -i (γ B t/2) } |-y> ] / sqrt(2 )

Now, we need to find the expectation value of Sz.

Sz is diagonal in the z-basis, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

So, ⟨ Sz ⟩ = ⟨ ψ(t) | Sz | ψ(t) ⟩

But perhaps it's easier to express |ψ(t)> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, then compute the expectation value of Sz.

Alternatively, express |+y> and |-y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>, so we can find the coefficients.

From earlier, |+y> = ( -i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, |-y> = ( i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2 )

So, substituting into |ψ(t)>:

|ψ(t)> = [ i e^{i (γ B t/2)} ( ( -i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ) 
           -i e^{ -i ( γ B t/2 ) } ( ( i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ) ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2) in each term:

First term: i e^{i (γ B t/2)} [ (-i |+z> + |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Second term: -i e^{ -i (γ B t/2) } [ (i |+z> + |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Wait, but |ψ(t)> is [ (first term) + (second term) ] / sqrt(2 )

Wait, no, wait. The entire expression is:

[ i e^{i (γ B t/2)} ( ( -i |+z> + |−z> ) ) - i e^{-i (γ B t/2)} ( ( i |+z> + |−z> ) ) ] / sqrt(2 )

But all of this is multiplied by another 1/sqrt(2) from the |+y> and |-y> expansions.

Wait, let me re-express step by step.

Breaking it down:

Each |+y> and |-y> term is multiplied by 1/sqrt(2). So when I expand them into |+z> and |-z>, each term in |+y> and |-y> gets another 1/sqrt(2), leading to 1/2 factors.

But perhaps I should compute each part step by step.

So, let me compute the first part: i e^{i (γ B t/2)} * (|+y> )

Which is i e^{i (γ B t/2)} * [ (-i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ]

= [ i e^{i (γ B t/2)} (-i |+z> + |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Similarly, the second part: -i e^{-i (γ B t/2)} * (|-y> )

Which is -i e^{-i (γ B t/2)} * [ (i |+z> + |−z> ) / sqrt(2) ]

= [ -i e^{-i (γ B t/2)} (i |+z> + |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2 )

Now, combining both terms and then dividing by sqrt(2) (since |ψ(t)> is [ term1 + term2 ] / sqrt(2) )

So,

|ψ(t)> = [ [ i e^{i (γ B t/2)} (-i |+z> + |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2) 
            + [ -i e^{-i (γ B t/2)} (i |+z> + |−z> ) ] / sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(2 )

Factor out 1/sqrt(2) from both terms inside the brackets:

= [ 1/sqrt(2) [ i e^{i (γ B t/2)} (-i |+z> + |−z> ) 
               -i e^{-i (γ B t/2)} (i |+z> + |−z> ) ] ] / sqrt(2 )

Which becomes:

= [ i e^{i (γ B t/2)} (-i |+z> + |−z> ) 
   -i e^{-i (γ B t/2)} (i |+z> + |−z> ) ] / (2)

Now, let's distribute the factors and group terms with |+z> and |−z>.

First, expand each part:

First part: i e^{i (γ B t/2)} (-i |+z> + |−z> )

= i e^{i (γ B t/2)} (-i) |+z> + i e^{i (γ B t/2)} |−z>

= (i * (-i)) e^{i (γ B t/2)} |+z> + i e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |−z>

i*(-i) = 1, so this is e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+z> + i e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |−z>

Second part: (-i) e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} (i |+z> + |−z> )

= (-i)(i) e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |+z> + (-i) e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |−z>

(-i)(i) = 1, so this becomes e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |+z> -i e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |−z>

Now, substitute back into |ψ(t)>:

|ψ(t)> = [ (e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+z> + i e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |−z> )
           + (e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |+z> -i e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |−z> ) ]
         / 2

Group like terms:

For |+z> terms:
e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |+z> + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |+z> 

= [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} + e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} ] |+z> 

= 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z>

For |−z> terms:
i e^{i (gamma B t/2)} |−z> -i e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} |−z>

= i [ e^{i (gamma B t/2)} - e^{-i (gamma B t/2)} ] |−z>

= i * 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> 

Wait, because e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sinθ.

So,

→ i * 2i sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> 

= i * 2i * sin(... ) |−z> 

But i * 2i = 2 i^2 = 2*(-1) = -2.

So, this becomes -2 sin(gamma B t/2) |−z>

Putting it all together:

|ψ(t)> = [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> - 2 sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> ] / 2

Factor out 2:

= [ cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> - sin(gamma B t/2) |−z> ]

So, the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)> = cos( gamma B t / 2 ) |+z> - sin( gamma B t / 2 ) |−z>

Now, we can compute the expectation value of Sz.

Sz has eigenvalues +ħ/2 for |+z> and -ħ/2 for |−z>.

So,

⟨ Sz ⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ 

But since |ψ(t)> is expressed in the eigenbasis of Sz, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

So,

⟨ Sz ⟩ = [ cos^2( gamma B t/2 ) ] (ħ/2) + [ sin^2( gamma B t/2 ) ] ( - ħ/2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ cos^2( gamma B t/2 ) - sin^2( gamma B t/2 ) ]

We can use the double-angle identity:

cos(2θ) = cos²θ - sin²θ

So,

= ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Thus,

⟨ Sz ⟩ = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma Sz.

So, the average of mu_z is:

⟨ mu_z ⟩ = gamma ⟨ Sz ⟩ = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

Wait, but wait. Let me check the units. gamma has units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}), since gamma = μ/(S), and S has units of ħ/2 (since spin is ħ/2 for spin 1/2). So mu = gamma S_z → units of (rad s^{-1} T^{-1}) * (ħ/2 ) → but actually, mu is the magnetic moment, which has units of J/T. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, which has units of rad s^{-1} T^{-1}.

But perhaps that's not directly relevant. Let's get back to the expectation value.

So,

⟨ mu_z ⟩ = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

The time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), which oscillates with angular frequency omega = gamma B.

So the frequency f is omega/(2 pi) = gamma B / (2 pi ), but the question asks for the oscillation frequency, which is omega, the angular frequency.

Wait, but looking at the expectation value expression: cos( gamma B t ), so the argument of the cosine is gamma B t. So the angular frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but let me think again. The function is cos( omega t ), so omega is gamma B.

But wait, the question is about the oscillation frequency. So the average oscillates as cos( gamma B t ), so the frequency is gamma B.

Looking at the options, option B is gamma B.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, in the expression for ⟨ Sz ⟩, the argument is gamma B t. So the cosine oscillates with angular frequency gamma B. So the time dependence is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B. So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

But wait, let me check an alternative approach. Another way to find the frequency is to find the energy difference between the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

The new Hamiltonian is H' = - gamma B S_y.

The eigenvalues are E_+ = - gamma B (ħ/2 ), E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

The energy difference between the two levels is E_- - E_+ = gamma B (ħ/2 ) - ( - gamma B (ħ/2 )) ) = gamma B ħ.

The time evolution of a state that's a superposition of these two states will have interference terms oscillating at frequency (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ.

So, (E_- - E_+ ) / ħ = ( gamma B ħ ) / ħ ) = gamma B.

So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

So the answer should be option B: gamma B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+z$ direction. When the field is suddenly switched off and turned on along the $+y$ direction (with the same magnitude $B$), the particle's state evolves under the new Hamiltonian $H' = -\gamma B S_y$. The goal is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle's magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of $S_z$, $|+z\rangle$, corresponding to $\langle S_z \rangle = \hbar/2$.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is reoriented along $+y$, the Hamiltonian becomes $H' = -\gamma B S_y$. The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. These states are expressed as:
   \[
   |+y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle + |-z\rangle), \quad |-y\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+z\rangle - |-z\rangle).
   \]

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state $|+z\rangle$ is expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:
   \[
   |+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, each component evolves with a phase factor determined by its energy eigenvalue. The time-evolved state becomes:
   \[
   |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( e^{-iE_+t/\hbar} |+y\rangle + e^{-iE_-t/\hbar} |-y\rangle \right),
   \]
   where $E_+ = -\gamma B \hbar/2$ and $E_- = \gamma B \hbar/2$.

4. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**: Substituting the expressions for $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ into $|\psi(t)\rangle$, the expectation value of $S_z$ is computed as:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \cos^2(\gamma B t) \frac{\hbar}{2} + \sin^2(\gamma B t) \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Using the trigonometric identity $\cos^2\theta - \sin^2\theta = \cos(2\theta)$, this simplifies to:
   \[
   \langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).
   \]

5. **Oscillation Frequency**: The time dependence of $\langle S_z \rangle$ is $\cos(\gamma B t)$, indicating oscillations with angular frequency $\omega = \gamma B$. Since the question asks for the oscillation frequency, $\omega = \gamma B$ is the answer.

### Critical Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.
- **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The angular frequency of the oscillations is $\gamma B$.
- **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the frequency.
- **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s moment is $\gamma B$.
