Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem states that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, each giving a different energy value.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that the energy-time uncertainty principle is relevant here. The principle says that the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) multiplied by the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least h-bar over 2π, which is a tiny number. Wait, more precisely, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ℏ/(2π), but sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, depending on the exact formulation.

Wait, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, right? So ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But I'm not sure about the exact factors; sometimes I see it written as (ℏ/2π) for the uncertainty product. Oh wait, the energy-time uncertainty relation is often presented as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So that's the key.

So, the idea is that if the energy difference is too small, the two states won't be distinguishable because the uncertainty in the energy would be larger than the difference, making it impossible to tell them apart. 

In this problem, the lifetimes are given. Oh, wait, the lifetimes are the lifetimes of the states. So, each state has a certain lifetime, and the uncertainty in time for each state is roughly that lifetime. So for E1, the lifetime (Δt1) is 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. 

Wait, but how does that apply to the energy difference between E1 and E2? Let me think. If we're trying to resolve two energy levels, the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy for each state is smaller than ΔE. Because if the uncertainty is bigger than the actual difference, the lines would overlap, and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the uncertainty in energy for each state and ensure that the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties. Wait, but the states themselves have their own uncertainties. So the energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties of each state's energy, perhaps?

Wait, no. Let's think differently. When you have two states, each with a certain uncertainty in energy, their energy separation must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, right? Because otherwise, the two states might overlap, making it impossible to distinguish them.

Alternatively, perhaps the combined uncertainty is what matters. Let's see.

The energy uncertainty for each state is given by ΔE = ħ/(2Δt). So for E1 with Δt1 = 1e-9 s, ΔE1 would be ħ/(2 * 1e-9). Similarly, ΔE2 would be ħ/(2 * 1e-8).

But wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 is ΔE = E2 - E1. For these two levels to be distinguishable, this ΔE must be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, or perhaps greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties? Or maybe each energy's uncertainty is smaller than the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps to resolve two lines, the separation between them (ΔE) must be greater than the sum of their individual linewidths (which are determined by their lifetimes).

Wait, that makes sense. The linewidth (which is the uncertainty in energy) of each state is inversely proportional to their lifetime. So if the two states have linewidths ΔE1 and ΔE2, the separation ΔE must be larger than ΔE1 + ΔE2 for them to be distinguishable. Otherwise, the lines would overlap.

So the plan is: calculate the uncertainties for each state, add them, and make sure that the energy difference is larger than that sum.

Let me compute each uncertainty.

First, calculate ħ/(2Δt) for each.

Given that ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So for E1: Δt = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 = ħ/(2 * Δt) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Hmm, but wait, the options are given in eV, so I need to convert this into eV.

I know that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J.

So, 5.272859e-26 J divided by 1.60218e-19 J/eV is approximately (5.272859e-26) / (1.60218e-19) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 3.29e-7 eV? Wait, wait, wait, let me recheck the calculation.

Wait: 1e-9 seconds is 1 nanosecond.

So 1e-9 s → ΔE1 = ħ/(2*1e-9) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert J to eV: 5.272859e-26 J * (1 eV / 1.60218e-19 J) ≈ (5.272859e-26) / (1.60218e-19) ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait, that's 0.329 nano-eV? Hmm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should have used E= ħ * frequency, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I missed a factor of 2π somewhere, but I think the formula I used is correct.

Wait, let me double-check the uncertainty formula. The energy-time uncertainty relation is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, which is the same as ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So yes, that's correct.

So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV.

Now for E2, Δt = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2 * 1e-8) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-27 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 ≈ 3.29e-7 eV, ΔE2 ≈ 3.29e-8 eV.

Now, the sum of these is about 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 needs to be greater than this sum, 3.62e-7 eV, to be distinguishable.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 → way less than 3.6e-7.

Option B: 1e-11 eV → even smaller.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV, which is much larger than 3.6e-7 eV.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00000001 eV, which is 1e-8, which is smaller than 3.6e-7 eV (since 3.6e-7 is 36e-8). So 1e-8 is much smaller than 3.6e-7.

Wait, no, 3.62e-7 is 3.62 ×1e-7 → 362 × 1e-9. So 3.62e-7 is 362e-9 eV.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 100,000e-9 eV. Which is way larger than 362e-9 eV. So option C would be sufficient.

Wait, but wait, the question is "which one of the following options could be their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved." So we're looking for any option that is larger than the sum of the uncertainties.

Looking back at the options: option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8. So that's much larger than 3.6e-7.

Wait, but wait, I thought the sum of the uncertainties was about 3.6e-7 eV. So any ΔE larger than that would be resolvable. So options C and maybe D?

Wait, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is 0.01e-7 eV. The sum we calculated is 3.6e-7 eV. So 1e-8 is 0.01e-7, which is much less than 3.6e-7. So option D is too small.

So the only option larger than the required is C (1e-4 eV). So the correct answer should be option C.

But wait, wait. Another thought. Let me think about the energy difference between E2 and E1. The question is about the energy difference between them, so perhaps I should compute the uncertainty for each state and see whether the energy difference is greater than the individual uncertainties.

Wait, perhaps the uncertainty in energy for each state is much smaller than the energy difference, so they can be resolved. So perhaps the correct condition is that ΔE is greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is larger than each uncertainty, then the two states are well-separated.

Wait, that's a different approach. So for E1 and E2 to be resolved, the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in E1 and E2.

Wait, but each energy level has its own uncertainty. For example, E1 could be uncertain by ΔE1, and E2 by ΔE2. So the energy difference between the two would need to be bigger than the sum of the uncertainties. Otherwise, the two states could overlap.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Wait, so earlier I calculated ΔE1 + ΔE2 ≈ 3.6e-7 eV. So the energy difference should be larger than that.

Looking at the options, only option C (1e-4 eV) is larger than 3.6e-7 eV. So option C is the correct choice.

But wait, let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

For E1: Δt = 1e-9 s → ΔE1 = ħ/(2Δt) = (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.272859e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 5.272859e-26 J / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ≈ 3.292e-7 eV.

Similarly, E2: Δt = 1e-8 s → ΔE2 = ħ/(2e-8) = 5.272859e-27 J → 5.272859e-27 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 3.292e-8 eV.

So sum is 3.292e-7 + 3.292e-8 = 3.621e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.6e-7 eV.

The options:

A) 1e-9 → 0.001e-6 → 1e-9 is smaller than 3.6e-7 → no.

B) 1e-11 → even smaller → no.

C) 1e-4 → 0.0001 eV → which is 1e-4 = 1e4 * 1e-8 → 1e4 times larger than 3.6e-7.

So yes, 1e-4 is much larger than 3.6e-7 → satisfies the condition.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → which is 0.01e-7 → 0.01e-7 is 0.01 × 1e-7 → which is 1e-9, which is way less than 3.6e-7. So D is too small.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, and \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (lifetime of the state). For distinguishable energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties in energy for both states, \( \Delta E_1 \) and \( \Delta E_2 \). This ensures the energy levels do not overlap.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainties
The reduced Planck's constant is \( \hbar \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). For each state:

1. **For \( E_1 \) with \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):**
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E_1 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
   \]

2. **For \( E_2 \) with \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):**
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
   \]
   Converting to electron volts:
   \[
   \Delta E_2 = \frac{5.272859 \times 10^{-27}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
   \]

### Step 2: Sum of uncertainties
The total uncertainty is:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.29 \times 10^{-7} + 3.29 \times 10^{-8} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
For the energy levels to be distinguishable, \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \approx 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Let us compare each option:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-9} \, \text{eV} < 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(too small)}.
  \]

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-11} \, \text{eV} < 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(too small)}.
  \]

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-4} \, \text{eV} > 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(sufficiently large)}.
  \]

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**
  \[
  10^{-8} \, \text{eV} < 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \quad \text{(too small)}.
  \]

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for distinguishability is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).

**Answer: C**
