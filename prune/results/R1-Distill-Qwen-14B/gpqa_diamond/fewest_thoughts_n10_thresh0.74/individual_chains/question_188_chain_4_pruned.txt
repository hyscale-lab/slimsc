Okay, so I've got this question about a rhombohedral crystal and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The formula for calculating this distance depends on the crystal system. Since the crystal here is rhombohedral, I should probably use the formula for that specific system.

Wait, rhombohedral is a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or no, wait, no, rhombohedral is actually a subclass of the cubic system. Or wait, no, rhombohedral is a separate system. Oh right, it's one of the seven crystal systems. The rhombohedral system has all sides equal but the angles are all equal but not 90 degrees. Oh right, so in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Oh wait, wait, interatomic distance is the distance between neighboring atoms along one lattice edge. So the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstroms. So a = 10.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (hk + hl + kl) * cos(θ) ) )

Wait, but wait. I
