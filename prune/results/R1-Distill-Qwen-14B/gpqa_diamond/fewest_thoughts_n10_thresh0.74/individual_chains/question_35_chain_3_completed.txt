Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I remember that intrinsic angular momentum is spin, right? So for a muon, which is a lepton, I think its spin is 1/2. That means the spin matrices should be 2x2 because spin-1/2 particles are described by 2-component spinors.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay. It says Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a specific matrix. Oh wait, S has rows (0, -i) and (i, 0). Let me write that down:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

But wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Sigma_y is actually [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ] which matches S. So S is sigma_y. Oh, because in the problem statement, S is given as that, so Ay = c * sigma_y.

Wait, c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * sigma_y.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenvector. So to find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But maybe I can think about the eigenvalues of sigma_y. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Therefore, Ay, which is c times sigma_y, will have eigenvalues c*(+1) and c*(-1). So a can be c or -c.

c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, let's check.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the eigenvalues are real, their imaginary parts should be zero. So option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Wait, that doesn't fit our conclusion. Our eigenvalues are real, so imaginary part is zero. So B is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Ah, wait, sigma_y is a Hermitian matrix because it's a Pauli matrix. So Ay is Hermitian because c is real and S is Hermitian. Therefore, the eigenvalues a must be real. So the eigenvalues of Ay are real, which means their imaginary parts are zero. So any option that suggests otherwise is wrong.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: eigenvalues have non-zero imaginary parts. So A is wrong.

Option B: also non-zero imaginary parts. So B is wrong.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Let's think. A² would be (Ay)^2, which for any spin-1/2 system, A² should be (h²/(16 π²)) * I, where I is the identity matrix. Because sigma_y squared is I. So if Ay² is proportional to identity, then any vector is an eigenstate of Ay² with eigenvalue (h²/(16 π²)) * (1/2)(1/2 +1) )? Wait, wait, A is the spin component, so A² would be proportional to the spin operator squared. Actually, for spin 1/2, the total spin squared is (s(s+1)) times ħ², but each component's square is s_x² + s_y² + s_z², but each individual component squared might not be the same. Wait, no, the sum is s(s+1)ħ². So each component's operator squared is part of that sum.

Wait, but for a single component like Ay, the eigenstates might not be eigenstates of the square. Alternatively, for any operator, if you have an eigenstate of Ay, then it's going to have a definite value of Ay. But A², being the square, would have the eigenvalue (h/(4π))² times (eigenvalue of S_y)^2. Since the eigenvalues of S_y are ±1, then (S_y)^2 is 1, so (Ay)^2 = (h/(4π))² I. So any vector is an eigenstate of Ay², which would have eigenvalue (h/(4π))². So if Ay has an eigenstate φ, then φ is also an eigenstate of Ay². Therefore, Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. But can they be eigenfunctions of Az?

Az is the Z-component, which is another spin component. For spin 1/2, the eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of the eigenstates of Az. So the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So the first part of C is correct, the second part is also correct. So C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. I'm not sure about this. The basis functions are typically the eigenvectors of the operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenfunctions, which form a basis for the space. So the eigenfunctions are a basis. So D is correct? Wait, the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Well, the basis functions of the operator... I think that's correct. Because the eigenvectors form a basis. So D could be correct. But let's think again.

Wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So, which of these statements is correct in the context of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Let me think about each option again. Let's process each.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. As I concluded, correct. Because a state with definite Ay would have definite A² (since A² is scalar in this case), but not definite Az.

Option D: Eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So D is correct because the eigenvectors are a basis for the space, so yes, they are the basis functions. So both C and D are correct statements? But wait, the options are such that only one is correct.

Wait, no. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. Let's read the options carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

But wait, more accurately, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² because A² is (h/(4π))^2 * (sigma_y)^2, which is (h/(4π))^2 times the identity matrix. So every vector is an eigenstate of A². So any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So C's first part is correct.

The second part says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. That's correct because eigenstates of sigma_y are superpositions of the eigenstates of sigma_z, so they won't be eigenstates of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So the basis functions of the operator... Hmm, operator is a matrix, and its eigenfunctions are the basis vectors. So D is correct.

Wait, but can the statements C and D both be correct? Because the question is a multiple-choice, only one option is correct.

Wait, let's think again. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So maybe D is correct because the eigenvectors form the basis.

But what's the correct answer?

Wait, perhaps I should proceed to calculate the eigenvalues.

So, Ay is a 2x2 matrix:

Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

The eigenvalues are given by det( Ay - a I ) = 0.

The matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i (h/(4π)) ], [i (h/(4π)), 0 ] ]

So the characteristic equation is:

( -a ) ( a ) - ( -i (h/(4π)) ) (i (h/(4π)) ) ) =0

Which simplifies to:

- a² - ( (-i)(i) ) (h^2/(16 π²) ) = 0

Wait, compute the determinant:

| -a       (-i c)     |
| i c      -a         |

So determinant = (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i)(i) ) c².

Now, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So determinant is a² - (1) c² = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

Thus, the eigenvalues are c and -c, which are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are real, as I thought earlier. So any option that claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts is wrong (A and B are out).

So now, looking back at the options:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That's correct because A² is c² I, so all eigenvectors are eigenvectors of A². But they are not eigenvectors of Az.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, D is correct.

Wait, so which of C or D is correct? Let me read their statements.

Option C: the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Which is correct.

Wait, but the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation. So all the statements about the process.

So during calculation, which statements are correct.

Option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are shared with A².

So the correct answer must be C or D.

Wait, another approach: What is the relation between the eigenfunctions of Ay and Az?

The eigenstates of Ay are superpositions of the eigenstates of Az. So they are not eigenstates of Az.

Thus, option C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, yes, D is correct.

But the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So, let me think about each option.

Option D: correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis.

But wait, all 2x2 matrices can be diagonalized by their eigenvectors, which form a basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But no, I think the question expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure of the eigenvectors.

The eigenvectors of Ay would be proportional to (1, ±i) or something like that, because Ay is sigma_y scaled by c.

Wait, let's compute eigenvectors.

For a = c (h/(4π)).

We have (Ay - a I) v = 0.

Ay is:

[ 0         -i c ]
[i c        0  ]

Subtract a I:

[ -a      -i c ]
[ i c     -a ]

So for a = c:

[ -c      -i c ]
[ i c     -c ]

The first equation is (-c) v1 -i c v2 = 0 → (-v1) -i v2 = 0 → v1 = -i v2.

So eigenvectors are of the form [ -i v2, v2 ]^T. So any scalar multiple, say v2 =1: eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly for a = -c, the equations lead to v1 = i v2, so eigenvectors like [i, 1]^T.

So eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ] and [ i, 1 ].

So these are the basis functions for the operator. Therefore, option D says eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So yes, D is correct.

But wait, the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Now, looking back at the options, option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², which they are, because A² is c^2 I. So any vector is an eigenstate of A². Therefore, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

But the question is about which is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But looking at the options, only one is correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should think of what the options are.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. So when you diagonalize Ay, the eigenfunctions form the basis. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because the columns of the matrix for the eigenvectors (when diagonalized) are the basis functions. So yes, D is correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Now, let me think about the other options again.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), which are real. So A is wrong.

Option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because the eigenvalues are real. So B is wrong.

So only C and D are possible.

Option C: eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Which of these is correct?

I think both are correct. But the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option D is talking about the nature of the eigenvectors. Since the eigenvectors do form a basis, option D is correct.

But what about option C?

Option C is correct because eigenstates of Ay are eigenstates of A² (since A² is a multiple of identity) but not of Az.

So both C and D are correct statements. But since the options are presented as multiple-choice, perhaps only one is correct, and perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the statement in option D is incorrect. Because the basis functions of the operator Ay are the eigenvectors. Wait, no, the matrix operator's eigenvectors are functions that form the basis. So D is correct.

Wait, but the problem is in the context of the calculation. So during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which statement is correct.

So during the calculation, the correct statements would be about the process.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

But if the eigenfunctions are the same as A²'s, then that's correct. Because A² is a scalar multiple of identity, so yes. So option C is correct.

So the correct answer should be between C and D.

But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the statements again.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, the two eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But how about from the perspective of the matrix representation. The operator can be represented in the basis of its eigenvectors as a diagonal matrix. So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions.

So D is correct.

But then, why is option C correct? Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², which is correct. So both statements C and D could be correct, but the problem says only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick. Let me read the question again.

The question is: During the calculation, which statement will you consider to be correct.

So while calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which of the following is correct.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay.

So, what's the correct answer?

Alternatively, perhaps only one of them is correct.

Wait, the calculation involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So for each eigenvalue of Ay, the corresponding eigenvector is a basis function. So the eigenfunctions do form a basis (so D is correct).

But about C: the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is (h/(4π))^2 * I, all vectors are eigenfunctions of A². So if a vector is an eigenfunction of Ay, it is also an eigenfunction of A². So C is correct.

So in the options, both C and D are correct statements. But the options are presented as if only one is correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again about the eigenvalues.

Wait, Ay is (h/(4π)) sigma_y. So sigma_y has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So Ay has eigenvalues (h/(4π)) and -(h/(4π)). So their real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So options A and B are incorrect.

So the remaining options are C and D.

Now, the problem is which is correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2 but not Az.

Yes, because A² is proportional to identity, so any vector is an eigenstate of A². So the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². And they are not eigenfunctions of Az. So C is correct.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both are correct, but it's a multiple-choice question. The options are designed such that only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Option D: eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay.

Which is correct.

Since the eigenvectors form a basis for the space, D is correct.

But C is also correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because the question is about the eigenfunctions and their relation to other operators.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is incorrect because the basis functions are not the eigenfunctions of Ay, but rather the eigenvectors are the basis functions. Or perhaps the statement in D is correct.

Wait, the wording of option D: "The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

I think that's correct because the matrix operator's eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct.

But the problem is, both C and D are correct, which can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C. Because, another way to think about it: the eigenfunctions of Ay can be eigenfunctions of A², which is always true, but not of Az. So that statement is correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator.

Which is correct?

Since both statements are correct, but the question is multiple-choice, perhaps the intended answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C because the question is about the relation between the eigenfunctions and other operators, not about the basis.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to recall what the correct statements are.

The statement in option C is correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are indeed eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is a multiple of identity) but not of Az.

The statement in option D is also correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But since the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation, perhaps the right answer is C.

Wait, perhaps only one of the options is correct. Let me read the options again.

Looking back at the options:

Option C says that the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

I think both are correct. But in the given options, only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, another approach: think about the Pauli matrices.

The matrix S in the problem is sigma_y. So Ay = (h/(4π)) sigma_y.

The eigenstates of sigma_y are |+y> and |-y>, which are the eigenvectors. These states are superpositions of the eigenstates of sigma_z (Az). So the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az.

So, the first part of option C is correct, and the second part is correct as well. So option C is correct.

As for option D, the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since the operator is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis. So yes, D is correct.

But in the given options, only one can be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the operator Ay satisfies Ay^2 = (h^2/(16 π²)) * I. So any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A², which has eigenvalue (h^2/(16 π²)).

So option C is correct.

So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves the intrinsic angular momentum operator \( A_y \) of a muon, represented as a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matrix \( S \) corresponds to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \), which is Hermitian and has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). Therefore, \( A_y \) has eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real. The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are thus \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), and their imaginary parts are zero. This immediately rules out options **A** and **B**, as they incorrectly describe the eigenvalues as having nonzero imaginary parts.

### Analysis of Option C
The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), where \( A^2 = (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2) \). For a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle, \( A^2 \) is proportional to the identity matrix, meaning any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \), as the eigenstates of \( A_y \) are superpositions of the eigenstates of \( A_z \). Thus, option **C** is correct.

### Analysis of Option D
The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the \( 2 \times 2 \) vector space, as any set of linearly independent eigenvectors of a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix spans the space. Therefore, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are indeed the basis functions of the operator \( A_y \). Thus, option **D** is also correct.

### Conclusion
Both options **C** and **D** are factually correct. However, since the question asks for the statement that is correct *during the calculation* of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, option **C** is more relevant to the context of the problem, as it highlights the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and other operators like \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \).

ANSWER: C
