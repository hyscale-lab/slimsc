Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron. l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the z-component of the total angular momentum.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum) and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So, what's the probability that L1z and L2z are both -ħ?

Hmm. Let's break this down. I remember that for angular momentum, the state is given in terms of total angular momentum, which is the sum of the individual angular momenta. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state. I think that in the coupled basis, the state is expressed in terms of the total quantum numbers, not the individual ones.

Wait, the individual states would be |l1, m1> and |l2, m2> for each electron. But when they're coupled, you combine them into a state with total L and M. So, the coupled state is like |L, M> where L is the sum of l1 and l2, and M is m1 + m2.

In this case, l1 and l2 are both 1, so the total L can be 0, 1, or 2. The given state has L=2 and M=-1. So, this is a state where the two electrons combine to L=2, m=-1.

But the problem asks about the individual m's. Wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum has its own m, right? So, m1 and m2. So, the total M is m1 + m2.

If I'm to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1, then I need to find the expansion of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>, and specifically look for the coefficient of the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state.

Wait, but the coupled state is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 that add up to M=-1. So, for each possible pair (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1, the state |m1, m2> is present in the coupled state.

But the problem is about the joint probability of getting m1 = -1 and m2 = -1 upon measuring both L1z and L2z. So, I need to find the amplitude or coefficient of the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state in the given coupled state.

Wait, but the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> can be expressed as a linear combination of |m1, m2> states with m1 + m2 = M. So, in this case, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, M is -1. That means in the expansion, all possible m1 and m2 that sum to -1 are included.

So, for M=-1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

m1 = -2, m2=1 → but wait, each electron's l is 1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So m1 can't be -2. So the possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum is -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum is -1.

m1=1, m2=-2 → invalid, since m2 can't be -2.

Wait, no, m1 can be any value from -l to +l, which is -1, 0, +1 for each electron. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1, same for m2.

So, for m1 + m2 = -1, the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) → but m2 can't be -2, so only the first two are valid.

Wait, wait, no. Because for each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1. So when you add m1 and m2, possible sums are from -2 to +2. But in this case, M is -1.

So, what are the possible m1 and m2?

We need m1 + m2 = -1.

So, possible m1 and m2 pairs:

m1 = +1 → m2 = -2 → but m2 can't be -2. So invalid.

m1 = 0 → m2 = -1 → which is valid.

m1 = -1 → m2 = 0 → valid.

m1 = -2? No, because l=1, so m can't be -2.

So, only two valid pairs: m1=0, m2=-1; and m1=-1, m2=0.

Wait, but wait, that's only two possibilities. So, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these two |m1, m2> states.

But wait, I remember that when coupling two angular momenta, the state can be expressed as a sum of uncoupled (product) states with the same
