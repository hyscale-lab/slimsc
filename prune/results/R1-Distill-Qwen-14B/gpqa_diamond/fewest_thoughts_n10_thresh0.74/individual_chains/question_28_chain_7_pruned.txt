Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The starting material is (S)-4-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one. I remember that cyclohexenones can undergo various additions, like the conjugate addition since there's an enone system here. But wait, the first step is treatment with tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride and triethylamine. Oh right, that's a typical silylation reaction. Triethylamine is a base, probably deprotonating something so the silyl chloride can react. Since the starting material has a hydroxyl group (the 4-hydroxy), that's probably where the silyl group will attach. Silylation usually protects the hydroxyl group, making it an -OTBS group. So product 1 would be the silyl ether of the starting material.

Next, product 1 is treated with Ph2CuLi at low temperature, followed by benzyl bromide. Ph2CuLi is a Gilman reagent, which is a strong nucleophile. Wait, but wait: the starting material after silylation has a ketone (the 1-one) and a conjugated double bond (the cyclohexenone). So, the enone system is present. Gilman reagents typically do 1,2-addition or 1,4-addition. Wait, but in the presence of a conjugated carbonyl, it's a conjugated dienone? No, the structure is cyclohex-2-en-1-one, which is a cyclohexenoneâ€”so the enone is in positions 1 and 2. So, when a Gilman reagent is added, it would do an 1,4-addition or 1,2? Hmm, I think for enones, the 1,4 addition is more common for Gilman reagents. So the cuprate would attack the carbonyl carbon at position 1, but wait, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the cuprate would add at position 1 and then position 2 (since it's conjugated). Wait, maybe it's a 1,2-addition. No, wait, the cyclohexenone has the structure O=C-cyclohexene. So the double bond is between C2 and C3 (since it's 2-en). So the enone is at C1 (the carbonyl) and the double bond between C2 and C3. So when the cuprate attacks, where does it go? Let me think.

The enolate forms, and the cuprate can add either at the alpha position (1,2) or at a more distant position (1,4). Wait, but in a six-membered ring, the 1,4 position would be across the ring, but in this case, the ring is probably too small for that. Wait, maybe the reagent adds to the alpha position. So, the cuprate would attack the carbonyl carbon (position 1), leading to 1,2-addition. But wait, the starting material has a cyclohexenone, which is a conjugated enone, so perhaps the cuprate adds to the carbonyl, making a new carbon-carbon bond at the alpha position.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition (1,4). Let me think: in cyclohexenone (positions 1, 2, and 3), the cuprate could add to position 3. But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should draw the structure.

The starting structure after silylation is 4-TBSO-cyclohex-2-en-1-one. So positions: 1 is the carbonyl, 2 and 3 are double-bonded, and 4 is the hydroxyl (now silylated). So when Ph2CuLi is added, it probably does a conjugate addition. So the cuprate would attack the beta position (position 3?), forming a new bond there. Then, after workup with benzyl bromide, the benzyl group would add somewhere.

Wait, the process is first adding the Gilman reagent, which is a strong nucleophile. So the cuprate (Ph2CuLi) would add to the alpha position (the carbonyl's alpha), which is position 2. Then, when the workup is done, perhaps the organocopper would transfer the benzyl group from benzyl bromide.

Wait, no. The process is: treat with Ph2CuLi, then add benzyl bromide. So the first step is the conjugate addition. Let me think about the mechanism. The cuprate abstracts a proton alpha to the carbonyl, generating an enolate intermediate, which then attacks the carbonyl
