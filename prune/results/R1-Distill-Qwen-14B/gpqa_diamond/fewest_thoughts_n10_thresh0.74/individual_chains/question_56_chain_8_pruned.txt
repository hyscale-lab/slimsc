Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, the question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen due to dipole transitions, which follow certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules again? Oh right, for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So when an electron transitions, its angular momentum l changes by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, 1, or -1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. The final state is |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. But wait, that would mean the electron is transitioning from l=0 to l=0, which isn't allowed because Δl has to be ±1. Oh, but wait, the question says it's a two-step transition. So maybe it's going through an intermediate state.

So the first transition is from 3,0,0 to some state with l=1, then from there to 1,0,0. Because going from l=0 to l=1 is allowed (Δl=+1), and then from l=1 to l=0 (Δl=-1) is also allowed.

So first step: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>, because n can change by any integer as long as it's allowed. Wait, no, for hydrogen, the selection rule on n is only Δn ≠ 0. But the energy levels are quantized, so n can decrease or increase by any amount, but each transition must obey Δl=±1 and Δm=0,±1.

Wait, but the initial state is n=3, l=0. The possible next states would have l=1 (since l must change by ±1). So from l=0 to l=1, and n can be 2 or 4, but since the transition is to a lower energy state (since it's going from 3 to 1 in two steps), maybe the intermediate state is n=2, l=1, m=0, ±1
