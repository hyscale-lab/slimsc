Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit challenging, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances A1 through A5 are involved in different reactions. Our goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let's break down the information given.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The decomposition reaction might look something like A1 → A2 + F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Wait, oxidizing xenon... Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe it's getting oxidized, meaning it's acting as a reducing agent. So perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So A3's formula is probably YF something. A3 can also interact with xenon, but I'm not sure yet how.

Then, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Hmm. A4 is a binary compound of fluorine and Y, so it's YF something. When Y is added, perhaps a substitution reaction occurs. Maybe Y is displacing some F.

In water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So, A5 could be something that reacts with water, maybe like a salt that breaks down into an acid and a base.

Now, trying to figure out what Y is. Since there are five binary compounds with fluorine, Y is probably a metal that forms multiple fluorides. Let me think: metals that form several fluorides... Maybe group 17 elements? Wait, no, Y is probably a metal. Let's think of metals that form multiple fluorides.

Wait, wait, fluorine is in group 17. So Y could be a Group 16 or 17 element. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 gives A2 and F2. So A1 must be a compound that contains F and Y, and when it breaks down, it releases F2. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride of Y, and A2 is a lower one.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen? No, because oxygen is in group 16, and fluorine is in group 17. But oxygen and fluorine make OF2 and maybe others, but I'm not sure about the number of binary compounds.

Alternatively, maybe Y is chlorine? But that doesn't make sense because fluorine is already group 17.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal that forms multiple fluorides. For example, metals like iron or tin, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought. The decomposition of A1 releases F2. So A1 must have F in a higher oxidation state, such that when it breaks down, it forms F2 gas.

Wait, fluorine in F2 is in 0 oxidation state. So if A1 is a fluoride with Y, and when it decomposes, F is going to 0, that suggests that A1 has F in a higher oxidation state. For example, if A1 is YF3, which upon decomposition could produce YF2 and F2 gas? Or perhaps something else.

Alternatively, maybe A1 is a difluoride that decomposes into a trifluoride and F2. Wait, that doesn't make much sense because trifluoride would have higher F content.

Wait, maybe A1 is YF3. No, wait, perhaps A1 is YF4. If it decomposes, maybe YF4 → YF3 + F2? But I'm not sure about that reaction.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition gives A2 with ωF of 31.96%. Wait, ω is the mass fraction, I think. So the mass percentage of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%.

So let's calculate the molar mass of A2. Let's assume A2 is YF_x.
