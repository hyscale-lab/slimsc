Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And they're asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, okay.

Wait, right, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. I remember that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states. And σx is a bit trickier because it doesn't share the same eigenstates.

So the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the system. So for a given state |ψ⟩, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

Let me write down the given state. Let me denote it as |ψ⟩. So,

|ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

I should check if this state is normalized. The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them and add: (0.5)^2 = 0.25, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. Sum is 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

The operator given is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I need to compute the expectation values of σz and σx separately.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz in |ψ⟩ would be the sum of their contributions.

So, σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

So,

⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) + cross terms. Wait, but wait, cross terms? Hmm, because the state is a linear combination, when I compute the expectation value, I have to take into account the inner products.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩.

The state is |ψ⟩ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So,

⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩ = |a|^2 * (+1) + |b|^2 * (-1) + a b^* ⟨↑| σz |↓⟩ + a^* b ⟨↓| σz |↑⟩.

But wait, σz is diagonal in the basis |↑⟩, |↓⟩. So the off-diagonal terms vanish because σz |↑⟩ = |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩. So the cross terms (like a b* ⟨↑| σz |↓⟩ ) would be a*b* times (⟨↑| (-|↓⟩ )=0. So cross terms are zero.

So, it's just |a|^2 *1 + |b|^2 * (-1).

So, |a|^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25, |b|^2 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4=0.75.

Thus,

⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So that's the expectation value for σz.

Now for σx. Hmm, σx is a bit more complicated. It's represented as [[0,
