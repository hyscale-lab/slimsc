Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's read it again.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, in that region of the sky, N ∝ 1/plx^5. Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/distance. Oh, wait, actually, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 parsec divided by the distance in parsecs. So distance r is 1/plx. That makes sense.

So, if plx is 1/r, then we can express everything in terms of r. The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let me substitute plx with 1/r. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Let's compute that. 

Wait, (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1/(1/r^5) is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. Hmm, that's interesting. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh wait, the question is asking about the change in the number of stars as a function of distance, like the density or something.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The question is, how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)? So, it's about dN/dr, the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Or is it about N per unit volume? Hmm.

Wait, the number of stars in a region is often related to the volume. If stars are spread out, the number density would decrease with volume. But this is a specific case where N varies with plx in a particular way.

So, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, N = k * r^5, where k is a constant. So N = kr^5.

But wait, the question is, how does the number of stars change with distance? So, per unit range of distance. Hmm, but N is a function of r, maybe the rate at which N increases as r increases.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The number of stars in a region is given as N
