Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. Okay, let's break it down.

First, the setup. We have an operator P which has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which means that we're working in the eigenbasis of Pz. That's important because it tells me about the coordinate system we're using.

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

The question is asking for the uncertainty in Pz, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So, I need to find the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared in this state.

Wait, but since the basis is that of Pz, the matrix for Pz is diagonal. Looking at the matrix given for Pz, it's a diagonal matrix with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ). So, the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ for the respective basis states |1>, |2>, |3>.

Hmm, but our state |ψ> is an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So I need to express |ψ> in terms of the Pz basis states to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the expectation values directly using the matrix forms.

Let me see. The expectation value of Pz is ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩.

Given that |ψ> is a column vector [a, b, c] = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ], then the conjugate transpose ⟨ψ| would be [ -1/2*, (1/√2)*, -1/2* ].

But
