Okay, so I just came across this physics problem, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field region where intensity maxima and minima occur. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tan(theta) as theta.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark fringes. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22λ/(diameter). But here, the aperture is a polygon with a large number of sides, so maybe it's approaching a circular shape as N becomes very large.

Wait, but the apothem is given as 'a'. In a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular N-gon, the relationship between the apothem (a), the side length (s), and the radius (R) is known. But in this case, all apothems are the same, so perhaps the polygon becomes a circle as N increases. So maybe when N is infinitely large, the shape becomes a circle with radius a? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the radius R (the distance from the center to a vertex) is different. For a polygon with N sides, the radius can be expressed in terms of the apothem. The apothem a = R * cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a would be the radius of the circle. Because as N increases, π/N becomes very small, and cos(π/N) approaches 1. So R ≈ a for large N. So the maximum distance from the center to the edge of the aperture is a. So the diameter is 2a.

Wait, but wait. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumscribed circle has
