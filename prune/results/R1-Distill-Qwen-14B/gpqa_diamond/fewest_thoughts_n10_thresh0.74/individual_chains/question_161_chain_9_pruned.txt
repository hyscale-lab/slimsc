Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that's operating at 1000 kV. He used vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have as few gas molecules as possible in the sample compartment so that the electron microscopy can work better because there's less interference from gas particles.

But even with that, some gas molecules are still there, and the mass spectrometer detected them. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules under the vacuum conditions. The mean free path, I think, is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. So factors like the compartment's volume, pressure, and temperature would affect that.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes. It's not λ1 anymore; it's λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect it. Wait, why would the mean free path change?

I remember that the mean free path depends on the pressure of the gas. The formula for the mean free path λ is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the gas molecules, and p is the pressure. Since the temperature is the same, and d (molecular diameter) doesn't change, λ should be inversely proportional to pressure.

Wait, but in this case, the pressure is already ultra-low, so the mean free path is long. But when the electron beam is on, what's happening? Oh, maybe the electrons are interacting with the gas molecules. Like, when the electrons hit the gas, they might cause the gas molecules to ionize or something. Or maybe the gas molecules are getting charged because of the electron beam, which could make them interact more with the walls or other molecules.

Charged particles would have a shorter mean free path because they could stick to surfaces or be attracted to other charged particles. So, if the gas molecules are now charged, their collisions would happen more frequently, reducing the mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but why? Because when the gas is neutral, the mean free path is λ1
