Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The problem gives me the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things.

Wait, what's the formation constant about? Oh right, the formation constant, Kf, represents how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable and the reaction goes more to the right (the complex formation). So the formula for Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this solution, I have the Ca-EDTA complex already. The concentration is 0.02 M, which I think is the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA²-]. So what am I trying to find? The concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+].

Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, the Kf equation will let me relate these concentrations. But wait, I'm not given the concentration of EDTA; I'm assuming that all the EDTA is tied up
