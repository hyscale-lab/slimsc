Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound it is. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are different propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The NMR data provided is for 1H, with specific chemical shifts and multiplicities. I remember that in NMR, the splitting and integration can tell me a lot about the structure, especially the neighboring groups and their arrangement.

Let me look at the data again. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, a doublet of quadruplets?), 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet), and 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet). Hmm, each of these probably corresponds to different parts of the molecule.

Starting with the singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H. That's a good sign for an acetate group because the methyl ester (OAc) typically shows up around 2 ppm as a singlet. So that's probably the OAc group.

Now, looking at the other signals. The 7.0 ppm region is where aromatic protons usually appear, but wait, acetates are esters, not aromatic. Oh wait, maybe it's a vinylic proton? Because vinyl protons can be deshielded and appear in the 5-7 ppm range. Alternatively, maybe it's an allylic proton, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the first peak is 7.0 ppm, 1H, doublet with J=16. That's a pretty large coupling constant. A J of 16 Hz is quite big, which typically indicates coupling between two double bonds (like in a trans di-substituted double bond) or maybe between a proton and an adjacent double bond.

The second peak is at 5.5 ppm, 1H, described as a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, that's more splitting. Maybe this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another group with multiple neighboring protons. Or perhaps it's a proton that's next to a CH2 or CH group.

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet for 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something else, maybe a CH2 or a CH. Since it's a doublet, it must be next to a neighboring group with one proton. So perhaps a CH2CH3 group, but wait, in acetates, the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3 or similar? No, wait, acetate is OAc, which is CH3COO-. So the ester is R-O-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, no: esters are usually R-O-CO-R', where R and R' can be alkyl or aryl. So in this case, the other part is probably an alkyl group with a double bond, given the options.

So the compound is an acetate ester, with the R group being either propenyl or butenyl, either cis or trans.

Let me think about each option. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate,
