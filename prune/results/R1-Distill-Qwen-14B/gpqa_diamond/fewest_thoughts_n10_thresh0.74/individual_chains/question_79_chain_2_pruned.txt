Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question says that Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR data is given. I need to look at the H and C NMR spectra and match them to the options provided.

Wait, but what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane... Oh, wait, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Or wait, maybe it's a base. Alternatively, I think it's used in the formation of epoxides. Oh right, that reagent is often used in epoxidation reactions, like in the Prilezhaev oxidation or maybe other epoxide-forming reactions. So, epoxidation would add an epoxide group, which is an oxygen-containing ring, to a double bond.

So Compound X probably has a double bond that is being epoxidized. So the product would be an epoxide. So the product's structure would have an epoxide ring, an oxygen in a three-membered ring.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the oxirane is the epoxide. The substituents would be at position 2, which is the adjacent carbon to the epoxide. Styryl refers to a vinyl benzene group. So 4-methylstyryl would be like a benzene ring with a CH2 group at the para position attached to a vinyl group.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. That's a bit more complex. The substituent is a propenyl group with a phenyl group at position 1 and the oxirane at position 2. Not sure, but maybe an allyl group attached to the epoxide.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane is at position 2 and 3, and there's a methyl group on carbon 2 and a styryl group on carbon 3? Or maybe the structure is such that the substituents are at positions 2 and 3 of the epoxide. Hmm, not exactly sure about the numbering here. Wait, oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. So the substituents would be on the two carbons adjacent to the oxygen. So, 2-methyl and 3-styryl would imply substituents on each of the two carbons of the epoxide ring.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That's another way of saying the styryl group is attached to the epoxide at position 2. So the oxygen is in the epoxide ring, and one substituent is a styryl group on one of the carbons.

Wait, but the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh! That's actually used in the Prilezhaev epoxidation, which is for epoxidizing alkenes. So if Compound X is a styrene derivative, reacting it with that reagent would form an epoxide.

So looking at the product's NMR, it's an epoxide. Let's look at the NMR data.

1H NMR:
δ 2.28 (3H, s), so a singlet for 3H, probably a methyl group attached to something. Maybe a CH3 connected to an aromatic ring or to an electron-withdrawing group.

Then δ 2.31 (3H, s) another sing
