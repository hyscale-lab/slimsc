Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That's because the molecule has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry. Let me think about each compound one by one.

The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3? Or wait, wait, 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2..., but 2-methyl but-1-ene would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C(=CH2-CH(CH3))? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methylbut-1-ene would have a methyl branch on C2. So the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2 something? Wait, but but is four carbons. So 2-methylbut-1-ene is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would be five carbons. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 2-methyl would be CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3. So 1-chloro would have Cl on the first carbon. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to the first carbon, a methyl on the second, and the double bond between 1 and 2. So Cl-C(=CH2-CH(CH3))?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the Z configuration. The groups on each double bond carbon are compared. For (Z), the higher priority groups are on the same side. But does this compound have a chiral center? Let's see. The molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So Cl is on C1, which is double-bonded to C2. On C1, the substituents are Cl, and two CH2 groups—wait, no. Wait, structure is Cl-C(=CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, perhaps I should think again: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH(CH2CH3)) but wait, but but-1-ene has four carbons. Hmm. Alternatively, the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that can't be because but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe the correct structure is ClCH₂–C(CH₂CH₂CH3)=CH₂? No, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe a better approach is to figure out if the molecule has a chiral center. For a molecule to be chiral, it must have a carbon attached to four different groups.

But wait, the first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl–CH₂–C(CH3)=CH₂? No, because but-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh, wait, no. Let me write the structure properly. But-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH3. If it's 1-chloro, the Cl is on the first carbon, so Cl–CH₂–CH₂CH₂CH3? But wait, no, because 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have a methyl group on the second carbon. So Cl on C1, double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH2CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, but but is four carbons. Let me think: The molecule is Cl–C(R)=C(R')–R''–... so for but-1-ene, four carbons. So the structure is Cl–CH₂–CH(CH3)–CH₂CH3? No, because that's single bonds. Wait, no, but it's a double bond. So, structure is Cl-CH₂–CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, which is CH₂=CHCH₂CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl–CH₂–C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, because that would be five carbons. Wait, perhaps it's Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH2CH3? Or maybe Cl on C1, double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So it's Cl–CH₂–C(CH3)=CH2? But that's four carbons. Wait, but that's maybe correct. So the structure is Cl–CH₂–C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, because but-1-ene has four carbons. So that's correct: Cl on C1, double bond C1-C2, C2 has a methyl group, and the rest is CH2. No, wait, but that would be five carbons. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about whether this molecule has a chiral center. If the double bond is between C1 and C2, and Cl is on C1, but in the structure, does any carbon have four different substituents? For example, C1: Cl, two single bonds to adjacent carbons, and a double bond. So on C1, substituents are Cl, CH2–, and the double bond to C2. Wait, that's three substituents—maybe not. So perhaps C2 has a methyl group, a double bond to C1, and two single bonds. So C2's substituents: CH(CH3), CH2–, and the double bond. So again, three substituents. So no chiral center in this molecule. Therefore, it's not chiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the molecule is (Z)-configured, but the question is about optical activity, which depends on chirality. So if the molecule isn't chiral, then no optical activity. So for this compound, Z configuration doesn't imply a chiral center. So I think this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Next compound: (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me think. Methanoisobenzofuran sounds like a fused ring. The substituent is chloromethylene (Cl–CH₂–). The E stereochemistry is probably in the double bond. So the molecule has a bridge or a ring structure. Now, does this ring have any chiral centers? Well, the substituents are at specific positions. The R and S configurations at 3a and 7a suggest that those carbons are stereogenic centers. So if those carbons are connected to four different groups, then they are chiral. So the molecule has stereogenic centers, meaning it's chiral, so it should exhibit optical activity.

Third compound: (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. Succinic acid is HOOCCH₂CH₂COOH. If the substituents are 2R and 3S methyl groups, then each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. Let me see: C2 is attached to COOH, CH(CH3), another CH2, and the adjacent C3. Similarly, C3 is attached to CH(CH3), CH2, COOH, and C2. Wait, but each of those carbons has four different groups?

For C2: groups would be CH2COOH, CH(CH3), another CH2, and the adjacent C3. Wait, is that four different groups? Let me see: the substituents on C2 are (a) the COOH group (from C2 being the second carbon), (b) the methyl group (CH(CH3)), (c) the CH2 group leading to C1 (which is another COOH?), or perhaps wait, let me think. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, because succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would have methyl groups on C2 and C3. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). So each of those carbons: C2 is connected to (1) the adjacent C1 (which is a COOH group), (2) CH(CH3), (3) the adjacent C3 (which has another CH(CH3)), and (4) a hydrogen? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2,3-dimethyl, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has the substituents: two methyl groups, right? Wait, each CH(CH3) is connected to two methyl groups? No, each CH(CH3) is connected to one methyl. So for C2, substituents are (1) HOOC–, (2) CH(CH3), (3) CH(CH3) (from C3), and (4) H? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) is connected to:

For C2: (a) the carbonyl group (from C1: COOH), (b) a methyl group, (c) the adjacent C3, which is CH(CH3), and (d) a hydrogen? So C2 has four substituents: COOH group, methyl, CH(CH3), and H. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C3, which is another CH(CH3). So C2's substituents: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), CH(CH3) (from C3), and H. Are those four different groups? Let's see: COOH, methyl, another CH(CH3) (which is like a CH2 group with another methyl?), or wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about each substituent. For C2:

- One substituent is the carbonyl group (from the C1: COOH).
- Another substituent is the methyl group attached to C2.
- The third substituent is the C3, which is a CH(CH3) group.
- The fourth substituent is a hydrogen.

Wait, but the substituent from C3 is a CH(CH3) group, which is a carbon attached to a methyl. So in terms of substituents, the groups attached to C2 are: -COOH, -CH(CH3), another -CH(CH3), and -H. So two substituents are -CH(CH3). So that's two identical groups. Therefore, C2 is attached to four groups, but two are same. So C2 isn't a chiral center because it's not attached to four different groups.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm wrong. Wait, C2 is attached to:

- The carbonyl group (COOH) on one side.
- A methyl group (CH(CH3)) on another.
- Another CH(CH3) group from C3.
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, but the third substituent is a carbon (C3), which is connected to a CH(CH3). So the substituent is a CH2 group with a methyl. So in terms of substituents, C2 is attached to: COOH, CH(CH3), another CH(CH3) (from C3), and H. So, the substituent on C2 is a methyl (the CH(CH3)), the substituent from C3 is another CH(CH3), so that's two same groups. Therefore, C2 has three substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), H, and another CH(CH3). So that's only three unique groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

At C2: groups are (a) the COOH from C1, (b) the CH(CH3) (the methyl on C2), (c) the next carbon (C3), which is a CH(CH3), and (d) a hydrogen. So the substituents are COOH, CH(CH3), CH(CH3), H. So two substituents are the same (two CH(CH3)). So no, C2 isn't a chiral center.

Similarly, for C3: substituents are (a) the COOH on C4, (b) the CH(CH3) from C3, (c) the C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and (d) a hydrogen. So same situation: two CH(CH3) groups. So C3 also isn't a chiral center.

Therefore, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. The compound is (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So maybe I'm wrong, perhaps the substituents are different. Let me try again. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So C2 has substituents: two CH(CH3) groups (from C2 and C3?), or perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual groups attached to C2 and C3.

For C2: attached to:

- A COOH group (from C1).
- A methyl group (since it's 2-methyl).
- A CH2 group leading to C3 (but wait, C3 is a CH(CH3), so the substituent is a CH(CH3)).
- And a hydrogen (if the structure is CH(CH3)).

Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So for C2:

- Two substituents are methyl (the CH(CH3)), but no, the substituent on C2 is a methyl group attached to C2. The substituent to C3 is a CH(CH3). So the groups attached to C2 are:

- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (the methyl group on C2),
- CH(CH3) (the substituent from C3),
- H.

So that's two CH(CH3) groups, which are the same. Therefore, C2 isn't a chiral center.

Same for C3: substituents are:

- COOH (from C4),
- CH(CH3) (the methyl group on C3),
- CH(CH3) from C2,
- H.

Again, two same substituents. So no chiral centers. Therefore, this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, the question says (2R,3S) configuration. If the molecule doesn't have chiral centers, how can there be an R and S configuration? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C3 are different. Let's see: C2 has:

- COOH group (from C1),
- methyl group (CH(CH3)),
- CH(CH3) from C3,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm not accounting for the substituents correctly. Let me consider each substituent in detail.

Wait, perhaps C2 is attached to four different groups. Let's list them:

1. The COOH group (from C1).
2. The methyl group (CH(CH3)) on C2.
3. The adjacent C3, which is a CH(CH3) group.
4. A hydrogen atom.

Wait, so substituents are COOH, CH(CH3), another CH(CH3), and H. So two substituents are the same (CH(CH3)), so C2 isn't a chiral center. Same for C3.

So therefore, this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical activity.

Wait, but then the (2R,3S) part is confusing. How can you have R and S configurations if the carbon isn't chiral? That suggests that perhaps the molecule has other stereocenters. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Hmm, maybe the molecule has another stereocenter. Alternatively, perhaps the groups are arranged differently. Or perhaps I'm not considering the correct structure.

Wait, maybe the structure isn't HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Let me check. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons has a methyl group.

Wait, but each of those carbons (C2 and C3) has:

C2: COOH (from C1), CH(CH3), another CH(CH3) (from C3), and H.

So again, two CH(CH3) groups. Therefore, no chiral centers. So the (2R,3S) must be a typo or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are different. Let me think, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH2-COOH. No, because it's 2,3-dimethyl, so both C2 and C3 have methyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each C2 and C3 have different groups. Wait, but in this structure, they both have methyl groups. So I think the conclusion is correct that these carbons are not chiral centers. So this compound doesn't have optical activity.

Fourth compound: (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. That's the same as the previous compound but with different stereochemistry. So same structure—no chiral centers—so no optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then each of the middle carbons has two CH(CH3) groups. So no chiral centers. So regardless of R/R, S/S, or R/S, the molecule isn't chiral. So no optical activity for this one either.

Wait, but then why are the configurations given? That's confusing. Maybe I'm wrong about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C3 are different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that would be pentane, not butane. No, succinic acid is four carbons, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons has a methyl group. So each has two CH(CH3) substituents, which makes them non-chiral.

So this suggests that this compound isn't chiral either.

Hmm, but perhaps I'm wrong.

Next compound: (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. So cyclohexene with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-en). So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with OH on C1.

But does this create a chiral center? Let's see. The OH is on C1. So substituents on C1: OH, three ring carbons (each connected to two other carbons and perhaps a hydrogen). Wait, in a cyclohexene, each carbon is connected to two others in the ring and two substituents.

Wait, for C1, substituents would be:

- OH group,

- Two adjacent carbons in the ring (C2 and C6),

- and a substituent from the ring structure. Wait, no, let's think about the actual structure.

Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has the ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1.

So for C1: what are the groups attached? Let me imagine the chair conformation or something. Alternatively, let's think about the structure. The molecule is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group on C1.

So each carbon in the ring is attached to two other ring carbons (except perhaps the ones in the double bond). So for C1:

- attached to C2 and C6 (the adjacent carbons in the ring),

- attached to OH,

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, so substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. Are those four different groups?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituents on C1 are:

- OH,

- the ring (so C2 and C6 are connected via the ring),

- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in reality, each carbon in the ring (like C1) is connected to two other carbons in the ring and two substituents. So for C1, substituents would be: OH, two adjacent CH₂ groups (assuming no substituents on C2 and C6, which might not be the case), and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me approach this differently. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents. So for C1 in this molecule:

- substituent 1: OH,

- substituent 2: the ring carbon C2,

- substituent 3: the ring carbon C6,

- substituent 4: a hydrogen.

But C2 and C6 are each connected to two other ring carbons and perhaps other substituents. Wait, but for C1, the substituents are: OH, two CH₂ groups (C2 and C6), and a hydrogen. Are those four different groups?

Wait, no. If C2 and C6 are each connected to two other carbons, perhaps they have similar substituents. But if the ring is symmetric, perhaps C2 and C6 are the same.

Wait, in a cyclohexene, the substituents on C2 and C6 would depend on the ring structure. But in this case, perhaps C2 and C6 each have two substituents that are CH2 groups. So for C1, substituents would be OH, CH2-C2, CH2-C6, and H. So if the groups CH2-C2 and CH2-C6 are the same (like if the ring is symmetric), then C1 would have three substituents: OH, two identical CH2 groups, and H. So that's three groups, so no chiral center.

Wait, but in reality, the cyclohexene ring has a double bond, which might make the substituents on C2 and C6 different. Let me imagine the chair conformation. The double bond is between C3 and C4, so the ring is in a chair with C3 and C4 as the double bond. Then, C2 and C6 are each attached to C1. In this case, are the substituents on C2 and C6 different? Well, in the chair conformation, C2 and C6 are in different positions relative to the double bond. But in terms of substituents, perhaps they're attached to similar groups.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH₂ groups (which might be identical due to symmetry), and H. So then, C1 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, this compound isn't chiral either.

But wait, the compound is (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The R configuration suggests that the OH is in a specific orientation. So perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Let me think again. If the cyclohexene ring isn't symmetric due to the double bond, maybe C1 has four different substituents.

Wait, let's think about each substituent on C1:

- OH,

- C2 (which is connected to C3, which is double bonded to C4),

- C6 (which is connected to C5, which is connected to C4),

- and a hydrogen.

So C2 and C6 are attached to different parts of the ring. So are the substituents from C2 and C6 different?

In the cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, C2 is adjacent to C3 (double bond), and C6 is adjacent to C5, which is adjacent to C4 (double bond). So, the substituents from C2 and C6 have different connectivity.

Therefore, C1's substituents are: OH, CH2-C2, CH2-C6, and H. If CH2-C2 and CH2-C6 are different, then C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. So the molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

But wait, in a cyclohexene ring, C2 and C6 are both CH₂ groups. Since the ring has a double bond, perhaps C2 and C6 are each attached to two CH₂ groups. No, that's not right. Let me visualize the structure.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring is:

C1 (OH) connected to C2 and C6,

C2 connected to C3,

C3 connected to C4 (double bond),

C4 connected to C5,

C5 connected to C6,

C6 connected to C1.

So, substituents on C1: OH, C2, C6, and H.

C2 is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond, so the substituent from C2 is a CH₂ group connected to C3, which is adjacent to a double bond.

C6 is connected to C5, which is connected to C4 (double bond), so the substituent from C6 is a CH₂ group connected to C5, which is adjacent to the double bond.

Are the substituents from C2 and C6 different?

In the ring, C2 and C6 are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the groups attached to C1 via C2 and C6 might be in different environments. For example, C2 might be attached to a CH₂ group that is on the same side as the double bond, while C6's CH₂ is on the opposite side. This would make the substituents from C2 and C6 different, leading to four different groups on C1. So C1 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

So this compound exhibits optical activity.

Next compound: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. So the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with three OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these positions is a chiral center if they have four different substituents.

But in a cyclohexane, each of these positions is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two other substituents (like hydrogens or OH groups). Let me think about C1:

Substituents on C1: OH, C2, C6, and a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) and two other substituents. So for C1, substituents are OH, two adjacent CH₂ groups (from C2 and C6), and a hydrogen.

Wait, but if C2 and C6 are each connected to other OH groups (like C3 and C5), then the substituents from C2 and C6 might be different.

Wait, no, in this case, C3 has an OH, and C5 has an OH. So for C1:

- substituents: OH, C2 (which is CH connected to C3), C6 (which is CH connected to C5), and H.

So are C2 and C6 substituents different?

C2 is connected to C3 (which has an OH). So the group from C2 is CH(OH)– something.

C6 is connected to C5 (which has an OH). So the group from C6 is CH(OH)– something.

Wait, but are the substituents from C2 and C6 identical? Because both are CH groups connected to an adjacent OH, but their positions might lead to different environments.

Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think about the cyclohexane ring. If it's a chair conformation, C1, C3, and C5 are axial or equatorial. But regardless, the substituents from C2 and C6 would be the same if the ring is symmetrical.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents on C2 and C6 are both CH(OH) groups. So they are the same. Therefore, substituents on C1 are OH, two identical CH(OH) groups, and H. Therefore, C1 has three substituents, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. Each substituent from C2 and C6 is a CH group connected to an OH. So if the ring is symmetric, perhaps the substituents are the same.

Alternatively, perhaps C2 and C6 are in different environments. For example, C2 is adjacent to an OH at C3, and C6 is adjacent to an OH at C5. Depending on the positions, perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are different.

But in a regular cyclohexane, if the substituents are at C1, C3, and C5, the substituents at C2 and C6 (from C1's perspective) would be CH groups. Each of those CH groups is attached to an OH at C3 and C5, respectively. So as substituents for C1, they are both CH– groups. Since the groups they are connected to (C3 and C5) are each attached to OHs, perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are similar but not identical.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are similar enough that they are considered the same. For example, if the substituents are CH(OH), then they are the same group. So for C1, substituents would be OH, two CH(OH) groups, and H. So that's three substituents, not four. Therefore, C1 isn't a chiral center.

Similarly, for C3 and C5, each would have substituents: OH, two CH(OH) groups, and H. So again, not chiral centers.

Therefore, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, but the question is about (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If any of the carbons are chiral, then it would be optically active. But in this case, none of them are. So no optical activity.

Last compound: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure: cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butanone (which is (CH3)2CO). So the structure is cyclopentyl–C(O)–CH2–CH(CH3)2? Wait, but butanone is (CH2)3CO.

Wait, the structure is: cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), then a CH2, then a CH(CH3). So it's cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3).

Wait, but butanone is four carbons: (CH2)3CO. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the cyclopentyl group on C1, then a CH2 group, then a CH(CH3) group, and a CO group.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2

Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is O=C-(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH3.

Wait, is that correct? So the carbonyl is at C1, connected to the cyclopentyl group and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, butan-1-one is R-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO. So 1-cyclopentyl would be cyclopentyl on C1.

So the structure is: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, but butan-1-one is four carbons (butan is four carbons), so:

Structure: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, butan-1-one is:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

So, the first carbon is the carbonyl. So 1-cyclopentyl would have the cyclopentyl attached to this carbonyl carbon. Then, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on C3. So the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2

Wait, but that's four carbons? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's not necessary for determining chirality.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is whether any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center.

Looking at the structure, the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to the cyclopentyl group, and perhaps two CH2 groups. So substituents are: cyclopentyl, O=C, and two CH2 groups. No, wait, the carbonyl is O=C–, so that's a double bond. So the carbonyl carbon (C1) is connected to: cyclopentyl, O (double bond), and two CH2 groups. So substituents on C1 are cyclopentyl, O, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, and another CH2 group. Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

No, that's pentanone, not butanone.

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So if 1-cyclopentyl replaces one of the H on the carbonyl carbon, the structure would be cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, 3-methyl would have a methyl group on C3. So:

cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons? No, butan-1-one is four carbons.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can approach this differently. Let me think about whether any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center.

The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center. The adjacent carbons (C2 and C3) would be CH2 and CH(CH3), respectively.

For C2: substituents would be (a) the carbonyl group (C=O), (b) two CH2 groups (C1 and C3?), and (c) a hydrogen? No, perhaps C2 is CH2 connected to C1 (C=O) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

Alternatively, perhaps C2 is CH2–, attached to C1 (C=O), and C3 (CH(CH3)).

So substituents on C2: C=O, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen. Are these four different groups? No, because two substituents are CH2 groups. So C2 isn't a chiral center.

C3 is attached to: C2 (CH2), C4 (CH(CH3)), and two substituents from the cyclopentyl group? No, the cyclopentyl is on C1. So C3's substituents: attached to C2, C4, and perhaps two CH2 groups.

Wait, no, perhaps for C3, substituents are: C2 (CH2), C4 (CH(CH3)), and maybe two hydrogens. So substituents would be CH2, CH(CH3), and two Hs. That would make three substituents, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 is CH(CH3) attached to C2 and C4. So substituents: C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), CH3, and H. So four different groups.

Wait, let me list them:

1. CH2 group (from C2),

2. CH2 group (from C4),

3. CH3 group,

4. H.

So substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, H. So two substituents are CH2 groups, meaning C3 isn't a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. If the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure would be:

cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because butan-1-one is four carbons, so the carbonyl is on C1, followed by three CH2 groups. So maybe the structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that's five carbons, which isn't matching butan-1-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But I'm not getting the structure right. Perhaps it's better to conclude that the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a stereogenic center somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is attached in a way that creates a chiral center. But the cyclopentyl group is a ring, so any substituent on it would depend on its own structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the central carbon (like C3) is a chiral center if it's attached to four different groups. For example, if C3 has a methyl, two CH2 groups, and a hydrogen, that's four different groups.

Wait, let's think again. For C3 in the molecule:

- substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3) (from C3), CH2 (from C4), and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but I'm not getting that right. Maybe I should stop trying to figure out the structure and instead think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or perhaps it's symmetric in some way, preventing chirality.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the substituents on either side of the central carbon are mirror images, then no chiral center would exist.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let me make a note and move on, perhaps I'll come back.

So, to recap the compounds:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers; no optical activity.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Has stereogenic centers (3aR and 7aS), so it's chiral; exhibits optical activity.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No chiral centers; no optical activity.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Same as above; no optical activity.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Has a chiral center (C1); exhibits optical activity.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No chiral centers; no optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: I'm unsure, but tentatively no chiral centers; no optical activity.

Wait, but let me think once more about compound 7. If the structure has a carbon attached to four different groups, then it's chiral.

Assume the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the C3 (the CH(CH3)) would have substituents: two CH2 groups, a CH3, and a hydrogen. So substituents are CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, H. So two CH2 groups, making it not a chiral center.

If the substituents are CH2-C(O), CH(CH3), CH2-CH2, and H, then: maybe C3 has four different groups. Wait, perhaps C3 is the central carbon in the structure. Let me think:

C3 in the molecule is connected to:

- C2: which is CH2 connected to the carbonyl.

- C4: which is CH2 connected to another CH2.

- A methyl group (CH3),

- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, perhaps the groups are:

C3 is attached to:

- C2: which is CH2-C(O),

- C4: CH2-CH2,

- CH3,

- H.

So substituents are: CH2-C(O), CH2-CH2, CH3, H. Are these four different groups? Yes, because each substituent is unique. So C3 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

Therefore, this compound does exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but earlier I thought it didn't. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me clarify.

Butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have the cyclopentyl group on the carbonyl carbon (C1), and a methyl group on C3.

So the structure is: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons. I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

Wait, but that's four carbons in the chain. So C1: carbonyl carbon, cyclopentyl, O.

C2: CH2,

C3: CH(CH3),

C4: CH2,

C5: ?

No, butan is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH2CH3).

No, that's not matching butanone.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct approach is to consider that the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, thus no optical activity.

Wait, but earlier I thought that C3 might be a chiral center. So perhaps I should conclude that this molecule does exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but then in that case, the count would be:

Compound 1: no.

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 3: no.

Compound 4: no.

Compound 5: yes.

Compound 6: no.

Compound7: yes.

So that's three compounds with optical activity.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound7 didn't, but now I'm thinking it does. So let me recount.

Compounds with optical activity:

2: yes.

5: yes.

7: yes.

So that's three.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound2 had stereogenic centers, so yes.

Compound5: yes.

Compound7: perhaps yes.

So that's three.

But looking back, earlier in the analysis of compound2, I thought it had stereogenic centers (3aR and 7aS), so that's yes.

So in total, how many compounds exhibit optical activity?

1: no.

2: yes.

3: no.

4: no.

5: yes.

6: no.

7: yes.

So that's three.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound7 didn't, but perhaps it's yes. So the count is three.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound7 might have a chiral center, so that would make it yes.

So total of three.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 3.

But wait, I might have made a mistake with compound7. Let me think again.

The structure of 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one:

The molecule is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - C(CH3)H - CH2 - CH3

Wait, that's five carbons. So the carbonyl is C1, connected to cyclopentyl and three other carbons.

Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons, so 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, that's six carbons. No, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2.

But that's unclear.

Perhaps it's better to think that this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical activity.

Then, the count would be two compounds (2 and 5) with optical activity.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound7 might have a chiral center, but I'm not confident.

Wait, now I'm really confused. Let me try to think again.

Compound7: 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

The structure is:

cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), then a CH2 group (C2), then a CH(CH3) group (C3), and another CH2 group (C4), and a terminal CH3 (C5).

So the structure is: cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Now, looking for chiral centers. The carbonyl carbon (C1) isn't a chiral center. C2 is CH2, so no. C3 is CH(CH3), attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and a CH3 and a hydrogen. So substituents on C3: CH2 (C2), CH2 (C4), CH3, H. Are these four different groups?

Yes: CH2, CH2, CH3, H. Wait, but CH2 is a substituent from C2 and C4. Are they the same? Hmm.

Wait, substituents on C3 are:

- from C2: CH2– (connected to C=O),

- from C4: CH2– (connected to CH3),

- CH3,

- H.

So substituents are: (CH2–C=O), (CH2–CH2–CH3), CH3, H.

Wait, are those four different groups? Let me see:

1. CH2–C(=O)–cyclopentyl.

2. CH2–CH2–CH3.

3. CH3.

4. H.

So substituents are:

- A CH2 connected to a carbonyl and cyclopentyl,

- A CH2 connected to another CH2 and CH3,

- A methyl,

- A hydrogen.

These are all four different substituents. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

So now, the count is:

Compound 2: yes.

Compound5: yes.

Compound7: yes.

So three compounds.

But wait, earlier I thought compound7 had a chiral center, making it three.

So the answer would be 3, which is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound2 had a chiral center, making it yes, and compounds5 and7 also yes. So that's three.

But the possible options are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the answer would be B)3.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. A compound is chiral if it has at least one stereogenic center (a carbon atom attached to four different groups). Optical activity arises from chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound has a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 and C2 are not all different, and no carbon atom is attached to four distinct groups. Therefore, it lacks chirality and does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound contains stereogenic centers at C3a and C7a, as indicated by the (3aR,7aS) configuration. These carbons are attached to four different groups, making the molecule chiral. Thus, it exhibits optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   The structure of this compound is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Both C2 and C3 are attached to two identical CH(CH3) groups, meaning they are not stereogenic. Therefore, the compound lacks chirality and does not exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has the same structure as the previous one (HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH). As with the (2R,3S) isomer, the carbons at C2 and C3 are not stereogenic due to identical substituents. Thus, it does not exhibit optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1. The substituents on C1 are OH, two different CH₂ groups, and a hydrogen, making it a stereogenic center. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three OH groups on C1, C3, and C5 of a cyclohexane ring. However, due to the symmetry of the molecule, none of the carbons are attached to four different groups. Thus, the molecule lacks chirality and does not exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The structure of this compound is cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH₃. The carbon at C3 (CH(CH₃)) is attached to four different groups: CH₂ (from C2), CH₂ (from C4), CH₃, and H. This makes it a stereogenic center, and the molecule is chiral. Therefore, it exhibits optical activity.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
- **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
- **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
- **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  

Thus, **three compounds** exhibit optical activity.

**Answer: B**
