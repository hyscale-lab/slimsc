Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they want to observe the one more likely to transit. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both have circular orbits. Also, the host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's. Wait, but same radiiâ€”so Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, but same size as Planet_1's.

I think the key here is to determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is related to the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Oh wait, the transit probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbital plane compared to the star's size. So the formula I recall is something like the probability being (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by something else, maybe the impact parameter, but I think the main factor is (R*/a), where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, the exact formula for transit probability is (R*/a) * (1), but I think it
