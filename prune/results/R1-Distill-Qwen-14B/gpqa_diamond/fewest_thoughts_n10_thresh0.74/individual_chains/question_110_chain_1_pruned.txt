Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used on large telescopes. ESPRESSO is at the Paranal Observatory, which is in Chile, and HIRES is on the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17th magnitude in V can be observed, and HIRES can see brighter than 16th magnitude. So each spectrograph has a different limit.

The goal is to find stars that can be detected by both. That means the star's apparent magnitude must be bright enough for each instrument. So I'll need to calculate the apparent magnitude (V) of each star and see which ones are below (brighter than) both 17 and 16 mag.

Let me look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Since absolute magnitude (M) is the apparent magnitude (m) at 10 pc, if it's at 10 pc, m = M. So Star1's m is 15.5. But wait, waitâ€”no, actually, the absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if a star is at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is equal to its absolute magnitude. So Star1's m is 15.5. Now, HIRES can see up to 16 mag, so 15.5 is okay for HIRES. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 15.5 is also okay. So Star1 can be detected by both? Wait, but wait. I should check for any other factors, like interstellar extinction (dust), which is mentioned for Star3 and Star4.

Wait, the question mentions that for Star3 and Star4, E(B-V) is given, and we have to account for the absorption in V band. The formula given is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So for Star3, E(B-V) is 0.6, so Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. This extinction makes the star appear fainter. So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0, and with extinction, m_observed = m0 + Av. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is usually m_obs = m0 + Av, where Av is the extinction. So if the star's true apparent magnitude is m0, but due to dust, we observe it as m_obs = m0 + Av. Because higher magnitude means fainter, so more extinction makes it dimmer (apparent magnitude increases).

So for Star3: Apparent V magnitude is given as 15.5. But wait, no, wait. Wait, Star3's given apparent V is 15.5, but does that include extinction? Hmm, the question says for Star3, the apparent V is
