Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and think through each step.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method detects the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull causing the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength is measured, which relates to the velocity of the star towards or away from us.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is the orbital period of Planet #2 compared to Planet #1?

Hmm, I remember that the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula I think is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/2) ) * (1/( (1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3) )) ) * ( (1/( (1 AU)^3 * (1 year)^2 ) ) )^(1/3) ) ... Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I remember the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star) )^(1/3) ) ) * ... Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: the RV method gives the star's velocity, which is a function of the planet's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis) of the planet from the star.

The formula I'm trying to recall is K = ( (27.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (M_star / M_sun) )^(-2/3) ) * ( (P / yr ) )^(-1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_star)) )^(1/3) )

But wait, since both
