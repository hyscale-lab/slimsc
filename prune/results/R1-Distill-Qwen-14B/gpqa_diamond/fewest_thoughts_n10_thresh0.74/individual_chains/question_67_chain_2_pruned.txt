Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question involves two electrons in p orbitals, and we're looking at their angular momentum states. 

Alright, the state given is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. 

Wait, I remember that the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers l can be 0,1,2,... So each electron is in a p orbital (l=1). Now, the total angular momentum l is the sum of the individual l's. Oh wait, because when you couple two angular momenta, the maximum possible l is l1 + l2, which here is 1 + 1 = 2. So that makes sense.

The question is about the joint probability of measuring L1z and L2z both as -ħ. So each Lz is measured, and we want both to be -ħ. 

But wait, when you measure L1z and L2z, each can have eigenvalues m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron. So for a single electron, m can be -l, ..., +l. So for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. 

So the possible eigenvalues of L1z are -ħ, 0, ħ. Similarly for L2
