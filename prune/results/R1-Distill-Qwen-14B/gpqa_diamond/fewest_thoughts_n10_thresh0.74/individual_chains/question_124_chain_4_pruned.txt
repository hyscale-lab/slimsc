Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new types that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the walls.

Hmm, okay, so I think the key here is understanding how the Lorentz factor affects the particles' ability to reach the detector walls. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is related to time dilation and length contraction in relativity.

Wait, so the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds. That means their gamma is much larger than 1, which affects how much time they take to reach the walls from the center. Because the detector is spherical, the particles have to travel a distance equal to the radius to reach the wall. But because of time dilation, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime. So more particles would reach the walls if their gamma is higher because they live longer in our frame.

So the initial scenario has gamma = 20, and only 1/3 reach the wall. We want to find a gamma where 2/3 reach the wall. So the detection rate depends on the time the particles survive, which is related to their lifetime.

Wait, let me think. The particles are fast-decaying. So their proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in their rest frame) is very short. But due to time dilation, in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma times longer.

So the distance they can travel before decaying is velocity multiplied by lifetime. Since at ultra-relativistic speeds, velocity is approximately the speed of light, c. So the distance is roughly c * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

But the detector's radius is fixed at 30 meters. So the particles have to travel 30 meters before decaying. So the probability that a particle reaches the wall depends on whether the distance it travels before decaying is greater than 30 meters.

Wait, but how does this relate to the fraction that reach the wall? Let's model it. The particles are produced at the center, and each has a distance R (30m) to travel. The distance they travel before decaying is d = beta * gamma * c * tau. If d >= R, the particle reaches the wall; otherwise, it decays before.

So the probability P that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that d >= R. Since the particles are moving at a speed close to c, beta is approximately 1, so d â‰ˆ gamma * c * tau.

So we can write the condition as gamma * c * tau >= R.

But wait, how does this relate to the fraction of particles that reach the wall? Let's think about it probabilistically. The decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is exp(-t/tau). But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma tau
