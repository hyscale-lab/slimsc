Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. We need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface, right? So maybe I can use that here.

Wait, the divergence theorem is ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA over the surface. But the question is about computing ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV, so maybe using the divergence theorem would be the way to go because it's often easier.

But wait, is f(r) a well-known vector field? Oh! I think that this situation is similar to the electric field due to a point charge. The electric field E falls off as 1/r² and has only a radial component. The divergence of E in that case is zero everywhere except at the origin, where there's a charge. Oh wait, but if the charge is at the origin, then the divergence of E is proportional to the charge density, which is a Dirac delta function at the origin.

Wait, but in this problem, we're integrating over a volume that includes the origin (since it's a sphere of radius R). So, the divergence theorem would apply, but the flux through the Gaussian surface (the sphere of radius R) would be equal to the integral of the divergence over the volume.

Wait, but let's think about the field. If f(r) has only a radial component and magnitude 1/r², then its expression in spherical coordinates would be f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, where r̂ is the unit radial vector.

To find the divergence of f, let's recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/(r²)) [d(r² A_r)/dr + r sinθ d(A_θ)/dθ + (r sinθ)(1/θ) d(A_φ)/dφ ].

In this case, A_θ and A_φ are zero because the field has only a radial component.
