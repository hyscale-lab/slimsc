Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R.

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². And it only has a radial component. So in spherical coordinates, the field is along the r-direction, and the other components (like theta and phi) are zero. The magnitude is 1/r², but wait, since it's a vector, maybe I should express it in terms of the unit radial vector. So f(r) would be (1/r²) r̂, right?

The problem asks for the volume integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere. I remember from the divergence theorem that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field equals the flux of the vector field through the surface. So maybe instead of computing the integral directly, I can compute the flux through the sphere's surface.

Wait, but I should also remember what the divergence of f is in spherical coordinates. Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_theta theta hat + A_phi phi hat, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(A_theta sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/ sinθ) dA_phi/dphi. But since our vector field f has only the radial component, A_theta and A_phi are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r).

In this case, A_r is 1/r². So we plug into the divergence formula:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ). Hmm, because r² times 1/r² is 1, and the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f = 0?

Wait, if that's the case, then the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Because r is the distance from the origin, so as long as r is not zero, the divergence is zero.

But wait, what about the origin? Because the field is 1/r², which suggests that as r approaches zero, the field becomes stronger.
