Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to try to walk through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what's going on.

The question says that an organic chemist does two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4, also followed by acidic workup. They monitor using TLC, and when both are 100% done, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. We need to find out how many peaks appear in each.

Hmm, first I think I need to figure out what each reaction does. Let's break them down.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) and then acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3. The structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2 groups. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should write it more accurately. Hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, more accurately, hexan-3-one is pentyl group attached to a ketone. Let me think. The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

O

C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no. The carbonyl is on the third carbon
