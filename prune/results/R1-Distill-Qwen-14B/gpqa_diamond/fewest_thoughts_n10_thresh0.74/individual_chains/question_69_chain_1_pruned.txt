Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a decay process in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X^0 decays into Y^+ and Z^-. The proper lifetime (tau_0) of X^0 is 8e-16 seconds. The question asks what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to find the minimum resolution of the detector or something related to the decay length, maybe. Because when particles decay, the decay length is the distance they travel before decaying, and the resolution would have to be good enough to detect that.

Wait, but what's the relation between resolution and the decay length? Oh right, I think the resolution refers to the detector's ability to measure the position of the decay products accurately. So, to observe at least 30% of the decays, the detector's spatial resolution should be such that the decay points are distinguishable about 30% of the time, or something like that. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me think again. The proper lifetime is tau_0 = 8e-16 s. The lifetime observed in the lab frame would be longer because of time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime tau is gamma multiplied by tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c^2). Oh wait, E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, but in natural units, c is 1, so the energy E is gamma m c^2, so gamma = E/(m c^2) = E/(m) since c=1 in these units.

So, gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV ≈ 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 3.41 goes into 27 about 7.9 times. So gamma is approximately 7.9.

So, the lifetime tau = gamma * tau_0 = 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that: 7.9 *8 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 s, which is 6.32e-15 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. L = v * tau. But v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L ≈ c * tau.

Wait, wait, but wait. Tau is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is the proper time multiplied by gamma. So yeah, L = v * gamma tau_0. Since v≈c, L ≈ c * gamma tau_0.

So, let's compute that. c is about 3e8 m/s. tau_0 is 8e-16 s. Gamma is about 7.9. So L = 3e8 m/s * 7.9 * 8e
