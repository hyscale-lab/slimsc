Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. The question is about which partial wave is not permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So, the initial state is 1S0. The question is about the possible transitions to other states after emitting X.

Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out the possible quantum numbers for the final states.

Wait, wait. The initial state is 1S0. The 1S0 notation, as per the note, is (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0: 2S+1 is 1, so S=0. L is S, so L=0, and J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When the two nucleons emit a particle X, the process is something like NN → NN' + X. But wait, the problem says the final state is the NN state, so perhaps X is emitted, changing their state.

Wait, no, the way it's phrased is that the system of two nucleons emits X. So the initial state is the NN system, and after emission, the NN system changes state, and X is emitted. So the initial NN state is 1S0, and after emitting X, the NN is in another state. So the final state is the NN in some state, plus X.

But the question is about the partial waves, which relates to the angular momentum involved. So I think each option gives a possible transition from 1S0 to another state, with X being emitted, and the question is which of these transitions is not allowed.

The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, but the notation is a bit unclear. Let me parse each option.

Each option seems to have the initial state (1S0), then the final NN state, and then the particle X emitted. For example, option B is 1S0 → 3S1 + p, so the NN state becomes 3S1, and X is a proton (p), I think. Because the particles after the arrow are the emitted particles, I suppose.

Wait, no, wait. The arrow probably shows the transition, so the NN system is in a state that emits X, so the process is NN (1S0) → NN (some state) + X. So the final state of the NN pair must conform to the Pauli statistics condition given.

The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN)
