Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is a concept from organic chemistry that counts the number of rings plus double bonds in a molecule. Right, each ring or double bond increases the index by one. So I need to figure out the structure of the product and then count those.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me break that down. The base structure is a cyclohexene ring, which means it's a six-membered ring with one double bond. So that's one hydrogen deficiency right there. Then there's a substituent at position 3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene part has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 (assuming numbering starts at the carboxylic acid). Oh wait, actually, the substituents are positions 2 and 5.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring. The carboxylic acid group is at position 1, perhaps. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-). Let me visualize this. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl).

Wait, the molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the formyl at position 2, and the vinyl at position 5. So the ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. So the parent ring is cyclohexene (one double bond), and the substituents are formyl and vinyl groups.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus and HI is a reaction I think is related to the Wittig reaction, but wait. Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrolysis of certain groups, or maybe for elimination. Or wait, I think when you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and you treat it with a phosphorus reagent, like in the Wittig reaction, you form an alkene. But wait, in this case, the starting material has a formyl group, which is an aldehyde.

Wait, but wait again. The reagents are red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when aldehydes or ketones react with P and HI, it's a type of elimination. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the formation of a ylide. Wait, the Wittig reagent is usually prepared from aldehydes or ketones and phosphorus reagents. So maybe the formyl group is reacting here.

Wait, but the starting molecule already has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5. Hmm, so maybe the formyl group is being converted into something else. Let me think. The formyl group is RCHO.
