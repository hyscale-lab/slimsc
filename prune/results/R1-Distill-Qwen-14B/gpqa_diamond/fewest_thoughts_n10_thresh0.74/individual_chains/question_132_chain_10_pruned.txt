Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both, which suggests each is a tetramethylbenzene derivative because benzene has 6 carbons and four methyl groups add four more, making 10. Wait, no, wait. Wait, C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so four methyl groups would add 4*(1) = 4 carbons and 4*(3) = 12 hydrogens. So total would be C6 +4= C10, H6 +12= H18. But the compound is C10H14. Hmm, that's not matching. Oh wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the molecular formula is C10H14. So the degrees of unsaturation must be calculated. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22 -14)/2=4. Benzene has 3 degrees (from 3 double bonds), so adding four methyl groups adds one more (each CH3 is a single bond, no effect). So that's 3+1=4. So yes, the formula matches. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene. Alternatively, one could have branching, but the options given are all tetramethyl.

The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet, in a 1:1 ratio. And three signals around 2.2 ppm, singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, 6.7 ppm is aromatic protons, probably in an environment equivalent due to symmetry. So the aromatic region.

Each compound has some symmetry. Let's think about each option.

First, the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B: 1,2,
