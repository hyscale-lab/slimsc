Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, let's read the question again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. So, I think this is a conservation of momentum problem because when particles collide, their total momentum before collision must equal the total after. Since it's an annihilation, all the energy goes into photons, so momentum is conserved.

Wait, but electrons and positrons are matter and antimatter, so when they annihilate, they produce gamma photons. But here, it's given that two photons are produced with same energy. So each photon has the same energy.

I remember that photons carry momentum, and their momentum is E/c, where E is energy. But since energy and momentum are vectors, their directions matter. Also, in the center-of-momentum frame, maybe things are symmetric.

Wait, but the initial momenta are not equal because the electron and positron have different masses? Wait, no, wait. Wait, electrons and positrons have the same mass, right? Oh, but their Lorentz factors are different.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is gamma. So the electron's gamma is 4, and the positron's gamma is 2.

So I need to calculate the momenta of the electron and positron before collision. But since they're moving towards each other along the same axis, their momenta are opposite in direction.

So let me think. For each particle, the momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, so perhaps it's better to compute their relativistic momenta.

Wait, the electron is moving to the right (since it's moving from left), and the positron is moving to the left (since it's moving from the right). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

But let me define the positive direction as the direction the electron is moving. So the electron is moving to the right, and the positron is moving to the left.

So
