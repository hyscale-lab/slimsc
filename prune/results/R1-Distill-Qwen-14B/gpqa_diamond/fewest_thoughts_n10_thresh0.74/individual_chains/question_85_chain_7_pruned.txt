Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. 

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on a few factors: the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the problem says both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out when we take the ratio.

The formula for equilibrium temperature, I think, is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4). Since albedo is the same for both, that term will be the same and won't affect the ratio. So our main variables are the star's characteristics and the planets' distances.

Wait, but how do we find the distance of each planet from the star? Because the problem gives us data from the transit and radial velocity methods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on that, but I remember that the RV method gives us the mass of the planet and the distance from the star (well, the velocity of the star's wobble, which relates to the planet's mass and distance). The transit method gives the planet's radius and the distance (since the transit depth depends on R_planet / R_star squared, but more importantly, the distance is determined by the orbital period and the star's properties).

Wait, no, the RV method gives the velocity of
