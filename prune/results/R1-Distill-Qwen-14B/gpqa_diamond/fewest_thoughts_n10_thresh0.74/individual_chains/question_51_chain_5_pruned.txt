Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with charges and conducting spheres, image charges come into play. But wait, this is a grounded sphere. Oh right, for a grounded sphere, the potential on the surface must be zero. So any induced charges will adjust accordingly.

So, the setup is: the charge q is outside the sphere. The sphere is a conductor, so the charges will redistribute on the surface. But since it's grounded, electrons can move in or out to maintain the surface potential at zero.

I think the method involves finding the image charge system. Let me recall. For a conducting sphere, the effect of an external charge can be modeled by considering an image charge inside the sphere. But wait, because the sphere is grounded, the potential on the sphere's surface is zero. So when the external charge q is placed near it, the sphere will have induced charges such that the potential at its surface is zero.

Wait, the image charge approach: for a point charge outside a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled as if there's an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge q' is placed at a distance of d' from the center, where d' is determined by the sphere's radius.

Wait, I think the image charge method says that for a conducting sphere, the image charge q' is such that the distance from the
