Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves two reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. After both reactions, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So, Reaction 1 is treating (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Then, after adding aqueous acid. Wait, what's the process here?

Epoxidation adds an epoxide group across the double bond. Since (E)-oct-4-ene is reacting, the geometry of the starting alkene will affect the product. I think when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic ring-opening. But wait, no, more accurately, it's a peracid adding across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to the epoxide. So the geometry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but in the case of (E) and (Z) alkenes, how does that translate into the epoxide structure? Let me think. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen bridges the two carbons, and the configuration depends on the starting geometry.

Wait, no, I think that mCPBA adds in a way that the oxygen adds to the same face, leading to a trans-dihydroxy intermediate which then forms the epoxide. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up with another reaction. Alternatively, peracid epoxidation leads to the formation of an epoxide with specific stereochemistry based on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, I recall that when a peracid epoxidizes an alkene, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that the resulting epoxide has a specific stereochemistry. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide would form with the oxygen on the same face
