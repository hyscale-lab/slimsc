Okay, so I've got this problem here about a vector field and evaluating an integral. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my vector calculus class that divergence and integrals are involved here. 

The problem says the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Oh right, so in spherical coordinates, the field only has an r-component. 

Wait, I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV, and the region is a sphere with radius R centered at the origin.

I think I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that only has an r-component is a bit simpler. Let me recall: For a vector field F = F_r r̂ + F_θ θ̂ + F_φ φ̂, the divergence is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (F_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dφ (F_φ). But since F_θ and F_phi are zero here, those terms drop out. So divergence is just (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

In this case, F_r is 1/r². So let's compute that. Let me plug in F_r = 1/r².

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] 

Wait, simplifying inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So the divergence is (1/r²) * 0 = 0?

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The function inside is r² * (1/r²) which is 1. So the derivative is zero. So ∇ · f is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin?

But wait, wait a second. The field is 1/r², which reminds me of electric fields. Like, a dipole field maybe? Or wait, the electric field of a point charge would be 1/r²? No, wait, for a point charge, the electric field is 1/r², but that's a monopole. Wait, no, actually, a point charge has a field that's proportional to 1/r², right? But maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's think again. If the field is F = (1/r²) r̂, then the divergence is zero except at r=0. That rings a bell. Because for a point charge, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it has a delta function. But in this problem, since we're integrating over a volume that includes the origin, the integral would pick up the delta function.

Wait, but the divergence is zero except at the origin, so how does that affect the integral? Oh, right! Because the divergence theorem comes into play. The integral over the volume equals the flux through the surface. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the divergence theorem here.

Wait, no, the problem is directly asking for the volume integral of the divergence. But if the divergence is zero except at the origin, then the integral would be zero? But that doesn't make sense because integrating a function that's zero everywhere except a point would be zero. Or wait, no—that's only if the function is zero everywhere except a point, but the divergence is not exactly zero everywhere except the origin. Because the field is singular at the origin.

Hmm, maybe I should better compute the divergence correctly. Let me try again. 

Given F = (1/r²) r̂. So F_r = 1/r², F_θ = 0, F_φ =0.

Compute the divergence: ∇ · F = (1/(r² sinθ)) [d/dr (r² F_r) sinθ + ... other terms zero ]

Wait, no, the correct formula is: in spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/r²) ∂/∂r (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂θ (F_θ sinθ) ) + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂/∂φ F_φ. Since F_θ and F_φ are zero, the other terms drop out.

So, ∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r )

Substituting F_r = 1/r²:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr [1] = (1/r²)(0) = 0.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. Because at r=0, the field is not defined. So the divergence is zero in the region outside the origin. But inside, when you integrate from 0 to R, you have to consider the singularity at 0.

So, the integral of the divergence over the volume would be the integral of zero everywhere except at zero. But the integral of zero over a region is zero, unless there's a delta function involved. So maybe I should think of this in terms of the Dirac delta function.

Wait, another approach: use the divergence theorem. The volume integral of the divergence of F is equal to the surface integral of F · dA over the surface of the sphere of radius R.

So, ∫ (∇ · F) dV = ∫ F · dA over the surface.

But F is (1/r²) r̂. On the surface of radius R, r = R, so F becomes (1/R²) r̂. The surface integral is ∫ F · dA = ∫ F · n dA, where n is the outward normal (r̂) and dA is the area element.

Since F · r̂ is (1/R²), and dA is R² sinθ dθ dφ. So the integral becomes (1/R²) * ∫ R² sinθ dθ dφ. The R² cancels, giving ∫ sinθ dθ dφ. The integral over θ from 0 to pi is 2, and phi from 0 to 2pi is 2pi. So 2 * 2pi =4 pi.

So the surface integral is 4 pi. Therefore, the volume integral of the divergence is 4 pi.

Wait, but earlier when I computed the divergence, I thought it was zero. How does that reconcile? Because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, so the integral over the volume includes a delta function at the origin. So the integral is 4 pi, which would correspond to the flux through the surface.

So the volume integral equals the surface flux, which is 4 pi. So the answer would be option A) 4 pi.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4 pi. So the correct answer is A.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R**, we start by analyzing the given field. The field is radial, with magnitude **f(r) = 1/r²**, and has no components in the angular directions (**θ** and **φ**) in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates for a radial field is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F_r \right),
\]

where \( F_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \). Substituting \( F_r \) into the formula:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence of the field is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field is singular. To compute the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius \( R \), we use the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary of the volume:

\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
\]

where \( \mathbf{n} \) is the outward unit normal vector to the surface. On the surface of the sphere (\( r = R \)), the field simplifies to \( \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{R^2} \hat{r} \), and the outward normal is also \( \hat{r} \). The flux through the surface is:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA.
\]

The surface area element in spherical coordinates is \( dA = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \), so:

\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \int_S R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integrals evaluate to:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi, \quad \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2.
\]

Thus, the total flux is:

\[
2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
\]

By the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of the field is equal to the surface flux, which is \( 4\pi \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
