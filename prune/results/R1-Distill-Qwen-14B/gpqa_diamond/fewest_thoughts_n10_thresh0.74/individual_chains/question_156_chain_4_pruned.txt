Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard and chiral. I need to see what the chromatograms show.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, which is typically used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is an oxidation reaction where the double bond is converted into an epoxide. The reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the product.

So, reaction 1 is (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA. Since E geometry is trans, when it reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, how does the geometry affect the epoxide? I think the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face. Oh right, mCPBA adds an epoxide group with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. So the trans (E) alkene would form a trans epoxide? Or wait, maybe the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the alkene geometry. Let me think: when adding the epoxide, the two new oxygen bonds form on opposite sides for a trans (E) alkene. So the epoxide would have a specific stereochemistry. Alternatively, wait, maybe the epoxide forms a cis ring if the starting alkene is trans. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. The epoxidation reaction is a concerted process. The peracid attacks the double bond, and the oxygen adds to the same face. So if the starting alkene is trans, the resulting epoxide would have the oxygen atoms added to opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Or wait, that's not exactly right. Let me visualize this. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds across the double bond, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry. So the two new bonds (O-C and C-O) are formed on the same face. So maybe the trans alkene would lead to a trans epoxide? Or is the ring structure such that the diastereomers form?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diastereomer formation. If the starting alkene is E, the epoxidation would give a particular diastereomer. Similarly, if the starting alkene is Z, it would give another diastereomer.

Wait, no, I think mCPBA adds an epoxide group in a way that the stereochemistry is preserved. So the E geometry would lead to a trans epoxide, and the Z geometry to a cis epoxide.

Wait, no. Wait, when mCPBA reacts with a double bond, it adds an epoxide group. The reaction is stereospecific but not necessarily creating a specific diastereomer. Let me think about the mechanism. The peracid's oxygen attacks the less substituted carbon in a syn addition. Wait,
