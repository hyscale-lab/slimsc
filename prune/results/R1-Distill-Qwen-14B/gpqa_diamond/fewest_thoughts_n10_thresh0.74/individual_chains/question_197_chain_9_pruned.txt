Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is about identifying a final product after a reaction. The compound X has some IR and NMR data, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I think red phosphorus and HI are used for the hydrolysis of certain groups, maybe esters or something else. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to convert an ester group into an acid. Because the reaction is called the hydrolysis of esters under acidic conditions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Or maybe it's for eliminating groups?

Wait, no, wait. Another thought: maybe the reagents are for the cleavage of certain protecting groups. Oh! Oh wait, when you have an ester and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it usually leads to the cleavage of the ester. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus in HI is used to cleave the C-O bond in an ester, producing an acid from an ester. For example, if you have an ester R-O-CO-R', treating it with H-I and red phosphorus would convert it to R-OH and R'-COOH, I think. Or wait, maybe it's more like the ester is converted to the acid. Let me think: the reaction is called the hydrolysis of esters, but under acidic conditions, right? Or wait, another point: maybe the reagent is for removing a tosyl group or something else. No, red phosphorus and HI are more about ester cleavage, perhaps.

So, first, I need to figure out what compound X is, based on the IR and NMR data. Then, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, I can determine the product.

Let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong peaks: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests O-H stretching, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or acid. But wait, 1720 is a bit higher than a ketone, which is around 1700. Esters are about 1730-
