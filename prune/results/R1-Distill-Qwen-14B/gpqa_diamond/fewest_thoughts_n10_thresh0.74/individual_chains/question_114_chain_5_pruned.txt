Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what it's about.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, which I think is a source of CN- ions, it's likely a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl group.

So the first step: butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, the product has a hydroxy group and a nitrile group both on the same carbon. That makes me think of the cyanohydrin formation.

Cyanohydrin formation! Right. The reaction where a ketone reacts with cyanide ion (CN-) under certain conditions to form a cyanohydrin. The conditions usually involve an acid catalyst, I think. Because the mechanism would be the attack of the nucleophile (CN-) on the carbonyl carbon after it's protonated, making it more electrophilic. So acid catalysis would make sense here.

So for the first reaction, A is probably an acid, like H3O+ or something similar. Let me look at the options. Option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option B has A as H3O+ and B as CH3COOH. Option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. Option D has A as NaHSO3 and B as CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: I've heard that sometimes when using NaHSO3, it can act as a source of H+ and SO3^- as the catalyst. But in the first reaction, the product
