Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different multiples of E. E is given as pi squared hbar squared over 2mL squared, which I remember is the standard formula for the energy levels in a 1D infinite potential well. Each energy level is n squared times E, so E_n = n²E.

Wait, but wait. Oh right, because each particle can occupy different quantum states, and since they're spin-1/2 particles, each state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So the total number of particles is four, which is 2 times 2, so each state can have up to two particles.

In a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n² pi² ħ²) / (2mL²), so each level is n² times a base energy E. So E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), which is the ground state energy for n=1.

Now, when you have multiple particles in the same well, each particle can occupy a different quantum state. Since the particles are identical fermions (because spin-1/2 implies they're fermions), they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But each quantum state can have two particles, spin-up and spin-down.

So for four particles, how do they fill up the energy levels?

Let me start by filling the lowest energy states first. The ground state would be the lowest possible configuration.

The first energy level is n=1. Since each can have two particles, that's two particles here. Then the next level, n=2, can take another two particles. So perhaps in the ground state, the particles occupy n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

Wait, but wait a second. For four particles, the ground state would have the lowest possible energies, so two particles in n=1 (same n, different spins) and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*E_1 + 2*E_2.

Wait, no. No, because each particle is
