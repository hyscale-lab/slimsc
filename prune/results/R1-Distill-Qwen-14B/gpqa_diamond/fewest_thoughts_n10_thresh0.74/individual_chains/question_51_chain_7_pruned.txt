Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let me try to think it through.

The question says: If a charge q is placed d distance away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R, what's the net potential energy of the system? The options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, the charges redistribute in a certain way. Oh right, a conducting sphere will have charges induced on its surface, but since it's grounded, any excess charge would go into the ground. Wait, no, wait. If the sphere is initially neutral and then a charge is placed nearby, the induced charges would be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same as the ground's potential, which is zero because it's grounded.

So, when a charge q is placed outside the sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the induced charge on the sphere would be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the charge outside? Wait, no, not exactly. I think the sphere's induced charges depend on the position of the external charge. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Alternatively, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the system's potential energy can be calculated by considering the work done to bring the charge to that position. But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. Hmm, but how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, wait. The potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. So here, we have an external charge q and the induced charges on the sphere
