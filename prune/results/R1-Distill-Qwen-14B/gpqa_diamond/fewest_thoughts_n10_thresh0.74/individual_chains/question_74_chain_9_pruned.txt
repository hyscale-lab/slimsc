Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But so far, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, wait. Let me read that again.

Oh wait, no, the next 150 minutes after the 50 that have already passed? So the total time from now would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes? Or wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The decay probability given is for 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. What's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes after the original start? Or from now?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "the next 150 minutes" — probably from the current time, which is 50 minutes after the start. So the remaining time would be 150 minutes after the current time. So total time from the start would be 200 minutes. But I need to think about how radioactive decay works.

Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? The probability of decay depends on the time elapsed, and it's independent of when you start observing. So the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't change the fact that the decay rate is the same afterwards. So maybe I should calculate the probability using the decay constant.

Wait, let's get this straight. The decay probability of 32% in 100 minutes is given. Let me denote P(t) as the probability of decay by time t.

So P(100) = 0.32. Since the decay follows an exponential law, P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

From P(100) = 0.32, I can find λ.

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ =
