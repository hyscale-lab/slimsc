Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there?

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Wait, benzene rings have substituents... so 1-bromo-2-d something. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylamino benzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the structure here. Maybe I should draw it out.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzeneâ€”so two methyl groups in the 2 and 4 positions, and a bromine in the 1 position. Or maybe the "d" refers to something else, like a double bond? No, benzene is already an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, is it 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or maybe 1-bromo-2-isopropylbenzene? Or perhaps the "d" is a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene
