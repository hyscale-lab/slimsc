Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem talks about Substance X, which uses a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated gives B. B's melting point is near 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. 

The product from a keto acid reacting with X has 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and its analogs are close. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think about the reaction. Violent reaction with liquid Y. What liquids react violently? Maybe something like water? Or maybe another liquid like ammonia. Wait, but if it's reacting with a liquid and releasing a gas, maybe it's a metal reacting with acid. Oh wait, but it's a liquid Y, not necessarily an acid.

Wait, gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think: possible gases like H2, O2, N2—no, let's calculate.

If the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, for a molecule, say, H2: each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So for H2: 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. 

Wait, maybe it's NH3? No, it's a gas, but NH3 is a molecule with 1 N and 3 H. Let me think about the atoms in W. Let's assume W is a diatomic molecule. Let's say it's a molecule like H2O or something else. Wait, maybe CO2? No, that's triatomic.

Wait, maybe W is carbon monoxide, CO. But CO has 6 protons and 8 neutrons in the molecule. Wait, each CO has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total in the molecule: 14 protons, 14 neutrons. Oh wait, that's same number. So CO has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Wait, but the molecule is CO, which has a total of 26 (12+14) atomic mass. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is something like NO. NO has 7 protons and 8 neutrons in each molecule. Wait, no: the molecule's protons would be 7 from N and 8 from O? No, wait. Each NO molecule has one N (7 protons) and one O (8 protons). So total protons: 15, and total neutrons: N has 7 neut
