Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

Wait, first, I should probably remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Oh right, but these are different types of acids and bases. Acetic is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So I need to figure out if there's a neutralization reaction happening here.

Let me jot down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH
- 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl
- 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2

I think the first step is to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Moles of CH3COOH: Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, right? So 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. But wait, each mole gives 2 OH-, so the total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to see how these acids and bases react. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it also dissociates completely, giving Ba^2+ and OH^-.

So, the H+ from HCl will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. Let me think about the neutralization reaction. H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So, how much H+ do I have? HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

Wait, wait. Wait, let me correct that. The HCl is H+ and Cl-, so yes, 0.08 moles H+. The Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it contributes 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles OH-.

So, when H+ and OH- meet, they neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. Let's see:

Total H+ = 0.08 moles (from HCl)
Total OH- = 0.18 moles (from Ba(OH)2)

So, the reaction between H+ and OH- will be: 0.08 + 0.18 = moles of H2O, but actually, the limiting reagent is H+ because it's less. So, the
