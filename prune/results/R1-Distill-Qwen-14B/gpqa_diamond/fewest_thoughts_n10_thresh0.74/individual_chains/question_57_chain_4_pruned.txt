Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude in an electron scattering experiment. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The incident electrons have an energy of 50 MeV, and we're ignoring higher phase shifts beyond these. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ, φ) is given by a certain formula involving the phase shifts. Oh right, for elastic scattering in the case of electrons, the amplitude is related to the partial waves. Specifically, the formula is something like:

f(θ, φ) = sum over l [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ) * e^{i l φ} ] * (something with Legendre polynomials) 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, I think the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction) might have a simpler expression.

Oh right! The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at zero angle (θ=0) is given by the sum of the individual contributions from each l. The general formula for f(θ=0, φ=0) is:

Im f(0,0) = sum from l=0 to L [ (2l+1) sin δ_l ] 

But wait, is that correct? Or am I getting confused with the real part?

Wait, let me think. The scattering amplitude can be expressed as f = sum ( (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ) ) / (1 + e^{2iδ_l} ) ) * e^{iφ l} 

Wait, no, I think a better approach is to recall that the scattering amplitude for spinless particles (like electrons in certain approximations?) can be written using the partial wave expansion. The formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l [ e^{i l φ} P_l (cosθ) ]

Wait, no, perhaps I should recall the formula for the imaginary part. Oh right, for the case when θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(cos(0)) is P_l(1) which is 1 for all l. So the expression simplifies.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The scattering amplitude f can be written as:

f(θ, φ) = sum_{l=0}^{∞} ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin
