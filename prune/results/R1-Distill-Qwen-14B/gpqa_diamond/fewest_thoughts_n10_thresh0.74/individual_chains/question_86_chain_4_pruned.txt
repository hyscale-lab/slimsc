Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. I need to figure out what starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Wait, the reactions are:
- Compound A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R) product.
- Compound B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S) product.

I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically a source of borohydride ions. But wait, BH3 is a different reducing agent, and I think it's involved in hydroboration reactions. Oh wait, LiBH4 is used in reducing carbonyl groups, like in ketones or aldehydes, to produce alcohols. But BH3 is usually used in hydroboration-oxidation reactions, which add boron to alkenes.

Wait a second, maybe I got this wrong. Let me think again. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a hydride source for ketone reductions. But BH3 is often used with THF as a Lewis acid in hydroboration reactions. So perhaps the starting materials are ketones, and the reducing agents are doing different things? Or maybe the starting materials are alkenes, and the reactions are adding boron in different ways.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. Tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring, similar to a sugar derivative. Pyran-2-one would have the ketone at position 2. So the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar, but wait, it's a ketone. So maybe the starting materials are some sort of carbonyl compounds.

Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring has an ethyl group at position 4. The substituents on the ring would influence the configuration when the ring is formed.

So the reactions involve going from a carbonyl to a cyclic compound. Wait, perhaps these are examples of ketone reductions leading to secondary alcohols, which then form cyclic hemiacetals or something else. Or maybe they're epoxide openings
