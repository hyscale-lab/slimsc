Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital orientation.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But their host stars have different properties. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Interesting, so same size but different masses. Let me recall, more massive stars are usually larger, but in this case, Planet_1's star is an exception because it's the same radius as Planet_2's, even though it's more massive. Maybe it's a subgiant or something slightly evolved?

The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star. Wait, the RV method was used to detect them, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But for transit probability, what factors are involved?

The probability of a transit (P) is given by the formula P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but actually, the exact formula I think is P ≈ (R_star / a) * (something else?), wait no. I might be mixing it up. Maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance (a), but in a specific way.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the probability is P = (R_star + R_planet) / a, but wait, no—actually, the formula is P = (R_star / a) * (something). Or maybe it's the ratio of the star's radius to the distance in the sky. Alternatively, another way I remember is that the probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by the impact parameter's range. Oh, right, the transit probability P is approximately equal to (R*/a) * (1/(1 + (R_p / R*))²)^(1/2), but that might be more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the geometry. The planet will transit only if its orbit, as seen from Earth, is along our line of sight. The probability depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbital distance
