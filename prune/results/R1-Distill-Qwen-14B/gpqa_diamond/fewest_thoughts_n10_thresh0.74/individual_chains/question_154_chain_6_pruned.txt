Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the correct answer is. Let me think step by step. So, the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, and I need to match the spectral clues to one of them.

First, let me list out the given data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. So, maybe that's a fragment or a different isotopic peak? Wait, molecular weight is 156, but there's a peak at 158, which is two mass units higher. That might suggest something like a chlorine substitution because Cl has an atomic mass around 35.5, but wait, wait, 156 is the molecular ion, and 158 is a doublet perhaps? Or maybe it's a fragment. Alternatively, could it be something like a deuterated peak? No, probably not. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula has a chlorine, so the molecular weight would be 156, but if the other peak is at 158, which is two higher, perhaps it's a Cl and another substitution, but I'm not sure yet.

The IR data shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, 3500-2700 is a pretty broad range. If it's a broad peak, perhaps it's an O-H stretch, which would be in that region. Alternatively, maybe it's a C-O or something. But strong broad peaks in that region are often due to OH groups, like in alcohols, phenols, or carboxylic acids. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. 1720 is typical for a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have a peak around 1700, but maybe in some cases a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester, ketone, or aldehyde could have a peak around there. But wait, an aldehyde's carbonyl is usually a bit higher, maybe 1720 is possible. Or maybe a carboxylic acid, but those can sometimes be broader due to hydrogen bonding.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there's a peak at 11.0 ppm, singlet, 1H. A singlet at 11 ppm is quite upfield for an aromatic proton, or maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, 11 is quite upfield, maybe it's an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have protons that are deshielded and appear around 10-12 ppm. So, if there's a singlet, that could be the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the NMR, the OH proton in a carboxylic acid is usually broad, not a sharp singlet. Hmm, but sometimes when it's deuterated, or under certain conditions, the peak could be sharp. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But 11 seems too high for an aldehyde.

Then there are two doublets: at 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). The coupling between these suggests that they are para-substituted aromatic protons. So, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents opposite each other. For example, if the ring has two substituents in the para positions, the protons would be as two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. The benzaldehyde would have a carbonyl, and an aldehyde proton. But the NMR shows 11.0 ppm as a singlet. An aldehyde proton is usually around 9.5-10.5, but a singlet suggests no neighboring protons. Wait, but in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to only one proton (the one on the ring), but maybe in this structure, the aldehyde is in the para position relative to substituents. Hmm, but the NMR has another peak at 11.0. If it's a carbox
