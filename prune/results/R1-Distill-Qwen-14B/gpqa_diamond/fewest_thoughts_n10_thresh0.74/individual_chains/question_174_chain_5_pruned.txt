Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest. Its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. And I'm supposed to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical, non-relativistic approximation. Oh, and ignore the electrons.

Wait, so the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum must be conserved, which means the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Since the initial momentum is zero, that's a key point.

Let me outline what I know:

1. Rest mass energy of the original nucleus: E_initial = 300 GeV. That's the rest energy, so E = Mc², which is 300 GeV.

2. After fission, two fragments. Let me denote their masses as m1 and m2. Given that one is twice as massive as the other, so m1 = 2 * m2.

Wait, but wait—no, wait. The problem says the sum of rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Since m1 is twice m2, then m1 = 2 m2. So substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the original mass. So the initial rest mass is M, and the sum after is 0.99 M. So the rest mass decreases, which makes sense because some energy is released as kinetic energy and other forms.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So E_initial = 300 GeV = M c². Then the rest mass energies of the fragments are m1 c² and m2 c².

So m1 = 0
