Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options provided.

Wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so the aromatic ring has two substituents. Let's think about what those substituents could be. The IR peaks: a carbonyl suggests maybe a ketone or an aldehyde group. The aromatic-halogen bond implies there's a halogen attached to the ring, like Cl, Br, etc.

So the compound is an aromatic ring (benzene ring) with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or maybe an ester), and the other is a halogen. Alternatively, one substituent could be a carbonyl-containing group, and the other a halogen.

Wait, wait, the ring is 6-membered, so benzene. Di-substituted means two groups attached. Let me think about the number of carbons. The entire molecule has 8 carbons. Benzene itself has 6, so the substituents must add 2 carbons. Wait, but substituents could be more complex. Let me think: if it's a 6-membered ring with two substitu
