Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. So wait, the ring is 6-membered, meaning it's like benzene, but with two substituents. Also, the total number of carbons is 8, so the substituents must add up to 2 carbons because benzene is 6 carbons. Hmm, but wait, wait. Wait, the benzene ring itself is 6 carbons, right? So if the molecule has 8 carbons in total, the substituents must be two groups that add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent is probably a methyl group, but wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and another is a halogen? Wait, but the IR data shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, the IR has peaks indicating a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents on the aromatic ring must be a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, substituents on benzene can't be just -C=O and -X (like Cl) because those are single groups. Wait, but wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents. Wait, but the carbonyl group could be part of something else. Like, maybe it's an ester group or a ketone attached as a substituent.

Wait, wait, the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is a carbonyl group. The other is a halogen. Wait, but a carbonyl group (like a ketone) would be a single substituent. So perhaps it's a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen, but that would make two substituents. But wait, the carbonyl group itself is a substituent, right? So the di-substituted benzene would have, say, a carbonyl group like O=C-R and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The molecule has 8 carbons in total. The benzene ring has 6, so the substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon? Because 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent is a single carbon? But a carbonyl group is O=C- something. So if the substituent is a carbonyl, perhaps it's a ketone, so the substituent would be a carbonyl group attached to the ring, like a benzophenone derivative, but that would have more carbons. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group as part of an ester or something else.

Wait, let me think. The substituents on the benzene ring are two groups: one is a carbonyl group (so maybe a ketone or an aldehyde or an ester or something), and the other is a halogen. But wait, the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen. So the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone) and a halogen (like Cl or Br).

Wait, but the total carbons are 8, so benzene (6) plus two substituents, each with one carbon. So substituents are -X (like Cl) and -CO-R? Wait, but that would add more carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think again. The molecule is di-substituted, which means two substituents on the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6, so substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent must be one carbon (since 2 substituents, 2 carbons). So each substituent is a single carbon group.

But a carbonyl group is typically O=C-, which is a substituent, but a single carbon. So perhaps one substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO) which is a carbonyl and has one carbon. The other substituent would be a halogen, like Cl, which is -Cl. So substituents are -CHO and -Cl. Then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (Cl) =7. But the total is 8. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are both single carbon but one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to another carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group. Like OCO-R. But that would add more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl ketone, so the substituent is -COCH3. That would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3), so benzene plus two substituents: one -COCH3 (2 carbons) and another substituent of zero carbons, which can't be. Wait, no, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the IR data. Peaks indicate a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So substituents include a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen (Cl, Br, etc.).

So the structure would be benzene with two substituents: -X (halogen) and -COR (carbonyl group). Now, the total carbons: benzene is 6, substituents are X (no C) and COR. So COR must add 1 carbon (since 6 + 2 =8). So COR is a carbonyl group with one carbon. That would be an aldehyde group (-CHO), which has one carbon (the aldehyde carbon is the R in COR). So substituents are -CHO and -X. Then, the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) +1 (CHO) +0 (X) =7. But the question says 8. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl ketone, which is -COCH3. That would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3). Wait, but then substituents would be -COCH3 and -X. So that's 6 +2 +0=8. That fits. So substituents are -COCH3 and -X. So the benzene ring has a ketone (as a substituent) and a halogen substituent. So the molecule is 8 carbons in total.

So the structure is a di-substituted benzene, with substituents at the positions, say, para or meta.

Now, what would the 1H NMR look like?

The substituents are a ketone (-COCH3) and a halogen (-X, which is probably Cl or Br).

In the NMR, the ketone's CH3 would be a singlet, maybe around 2.3 ppm or so. Wait, but in a ketone, the CH3 is adjacent to carbonyl, so in acetophenone (the structure is benzene with a COCH3 group), the CH3 is a singlet around 2.6 ppm. But wait, if there's another substituent, like Cl, that could affect the ring's substitution pattern and the NMR signals.

Wait, but then the substituents are in para positions? Or maybe meta.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So a singlet at 9.9, which could be an aldehyde proton. But if the substituent is a ketone, there would be no aldehyde proton. So maybe this is a benzaldehyde derivative. Wait, but the carbonyl would then be an aldehyde, not a ketone. So in that case, substituents would be -CHO and -X, but then the carbon count is 7. So that can't be. So option A probably isn't the right choice, unless...

Wait, let's think again. The question says the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. So substituents are -X (halogen) and -COR. If COR is an aldehyde, then the substituent is -CHO. So that would be a di-substituted benzaldehyde with a halogen.

But then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + 0 (X) =7, which doesn't match the 8 carbons. So that can't be.

So substituents must be -COCH3 and -X. So the structure is benzene with a COCH3 group and a halogen, say, para to each other.

In that case, the NMR would show:

The aromatic protons would be deshielded. If it's para-substituted, the ring would have two sets of protons. Wait, but with two substituents, the ring could have different substitution patterns.

Wait, in the case of para substitution, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets. For example, if the substituents are para, the two substituent groups would split the ring into two sets of protons. Let me think: benzene has six protons in the ring. When two substituents are para, the ring becomes symmetrical, and the protons would be in two sets. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, the two substituents are para, and the remaining four protons are in two pairs of two, each pair being equivalent. So in NMR, you would see two doublets.

In our case, substituents are a COCH3 and a halogen, which are meta? Or para?

Wait, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of protons. For example, in acetophenone with a para Cl substituent, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Because in the para case, the substituents are opposite each other, so the two adjacent protons to each substituent would be equivalent.

Wait, but in the case of substituents being para, the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as a doublet. Because each substituent would deshield the adjacent protons, and each set would be equivalent. So in the NMR, you would see two doublets, each 2H, perhaps around 7.8 and 7.6 ppm.

Now, the COCH3 group's methyl protons would be a singlet around 2.6 ppm, but looking at the options, option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm. So that might fit.

Alternatively, looking at the substituents, what else would be present.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So this would account for four aromatic protons (two doublets each integrating to 2H) and a singlet of 3H, which could be the CH3 from the COCH3 group.

So in that case, the substituents are a COCH3 (which contributes 3H as a singlet) and a halogen. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets.

But wait, the substituents are COCH3 and X, so in para position, the ring would have two sets of aromatic protons. So this would match option C.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) suggests an aldehyde proton. But as discussed earlier, that would require substituent -CHO, which would make the total carbons 7, which doesn't fit. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). These peaks are more indicative of an ABX system, perhaps from an ester or a geminal di-substitution. Maybe something like an allyl group or an acetal. But not sure how this ties into our compound, which has a benzene ring with a ketone and a halogen substituent. So this option doesn't seem to fit.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but with substituents, maybe. But this doesn't align with the expected aromatic peaks for a para-substituted benzene. The other peaks again suggest some kind of di-substituted group but not matching a ketone and halogen.

So option C seems to fit best. It has two doublets in the aromatic region, which suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents causing the splitting. The singlet at 2.3 ppm is probably the methyl group from the ketone substituent (COCH3), which would have three protons as a singlet.

So the correct NMR would be option C: 7.8 (d, 2H), 7.6 (d, 2H), 2.3 (s, 3H).


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The IR data indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen. 

Given the total carbon count, the carbonyl group must be a methyl ketone (-COCH₃), which contributes 2 carbons (one from the carbonyl and one from the methyl group). The other substituent is a halogen (-X, likely Cl or Br). This makes the structure a para-substituted benzene with -COCH₃ and -X groups.

In the **¹H NMR spectrum**, the aromatic protons will be split into two doublets due to the para-substitution pattern, with each doublet integrating to 2H. The methyl group of the ketone (-COCH₃) will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the ketone substituent. This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest an ABX system, which is not consistent with the expected aromatic and ketone signals. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) match the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the ketone. This option is consistent with the structure.
- **Option D**: A singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which does not match the expected para-substitution pattern. This option is incorrect.

The correct **¹H NMR data** is provided in **Option C**: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).

Answer: C
