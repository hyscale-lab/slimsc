Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at low energies, respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model. But wait, what symmetries exactly?

The question asks which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. Let me think about each of these one by one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I'm pretty sure that the Standard Model is a Lorentz-invariant theory, meaning all its operators respect this symmetry. SMEFT being an effective theory built from the Standard Model, it must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars. So 1 is definitely a correct symmetry that must be respected.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations? So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Well, SMEFT is a field theory, and field theories typically respect Poincare symmetry because they have a well-defined energy-momentum. So yes, all operators must be Poincare invariant. So that would mean 2 is correct as well.

Wait, but wait a second. SMEFT is an effective theory. Does it require all operators to respect Poincare symmetry? I think yes because the framework is built in a way that preserves the symmetries of the Standard Model, and SM respects Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

What about CP symmetry (option 3)? I'm not so sure. Some SM interactions (like certain terms in the weak force) do not respect CP symmetry. For example, CP violation is known in the weak interactions. So if the SMEFT includes terms beyond the SM, would they respect CP? Well, SMEFT operators can include terms that violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to respect CP. So 3 is not a must-respect symmetry; it's possible for operators to violate it.

Wait, but wait again. SMEFT is an effective theory where each operator is built respecting the SM symmet
