Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about the probability of a single atom decaying after a certain time. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, but it follows some statistical rules. 

So, the problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. That means, if we have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed on average. Wait, but wait, the question is about a single atom. But I think the same principles apply because the probability is given for the decay of individual atoms over that time.

Now, the situation is that 50 minutes have already passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So, we're now looking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. Oh, wait, no. Wait, if 50 minutes have passed, then the next 150 would mean total time from the start is 200 minutes? Or is the next 150 starting from now? Let me read the question again.

The question says: "So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?"

Ah, okay, so the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So the total time since the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, the given probability is for 100 minutes. So I think I need to relate the decay probabilities over different time periods.

I remember that for radioactive decay, the decay is modeled by an exponential decay law. The probability that an atom hasn't decayed yet after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. And the probability that it decays by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but wait. In this problem, the given information is that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me solve for λ.

So, 1 - 0.32 = e^(-100λ) → 0.68 = e^(-100λ). Taking natural logs on both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.68) should be around -0.385 or something? Wait, let me think. Let me approximate. Since e^(-0.385) ≈ 0.68? Hmm, because e^0.385 is around 1.468, so 1/1.468 is about 0.68. Yeah, so ln(0.68) is approximately -0.3856.

So λ ≈ 0.3856 / 100 per minute. Let's call that 0.003856 per minute.

Now, the next part: 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is e^(-λ * 50). Let me compute that: e^(-0.003856 *50) = e^(-0.1928) ≈ 0.825. So, the probability it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes is about 82.5%. Which makes sense, because the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, so in 50 minutes, the probability is lower.

Now, what's the question? The probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait,
