Okay, I've got this genetics question here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the setup is about white lupine and their resistance to anthracnose. The experiment involves knocking out three genes, G1, G2, G3, and looking at the resulting mutants.

The data given is about the resistance levels of each mutant and their double mutants. The control has 100% resistance, so when a mutant has lower resistance, it's more susceptible. Let's see:

- g1: 75% → so 25% less than control. So g1 mutant is a bit more susceptible.
- g2: 0% → no resistance. That's a big drop. So g2 knockout plants are completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% → half resistance. So this mutant is more susceptible than wild type, but not as bad as g2.
- g1g3: 10% → very low, almost no resistance. That's really bad.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2.

Hmm. The key here is to figure out the relationships between these genes. The question mentions that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors are usually upstream regulators.

Looking at the results, the g2 mutant is the most affected. It's completely susceptible. So G2's product is important for resistance. Since the double mutants involving g2 also are 0%, that suggests that G2 is acting in a pathway where if it's knocked out, everything downstream that depends on it is also knocked out.

Wait, so what's the relationship between G2 and the others? Let's think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if G2 is epistatic, then maybe it's acting upstream. Let's see.

In the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0% regardless of the other gene. For example, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%. The only one where G2 is not knocked out is g1g3, which is 10%. Wait, but g3 alone is 50%—so that's worse than g1 (75%). When you have g1g3, it's even worse at 10%, which is much lower than either alone.

So let's think about the phenotypes. The g2 mutant is the most severe, 0% resistance. The double mutants that include g2 also are 0%, which suggests that G2 is epistatic to the others. Because when G2 is knocked out, the other mutations don't matter anymore.

But wait, wait. Let me think. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then if G2 is knocked out, the downstream genes can't be expressed either. So knocking out G2 would make the plant completely susceptible regardless of the state of
