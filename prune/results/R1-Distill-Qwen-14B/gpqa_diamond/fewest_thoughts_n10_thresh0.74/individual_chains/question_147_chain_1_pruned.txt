Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is. 

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in particle physics, annihilation processes involve converting matter and antimatter into other particles. Here, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into four particles—two A⁺ and two A⁻.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, that probably means we can approximate its kinetic energy as much less than its rest energy, so maybe we can use non-relativistic approximations for it. But the daughter particles A might be moving at relativistic speeds, so their energies and momenta definitely need relativistic treatment.

I think the key here is conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial system is a moving proton and a moving antiproton, but wait, wait. Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the initial total momentum isn't zero? Or is the proton at rest? Wait, the question says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, the setup isn't entirely clear. Let me think.

Wait, the initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄). Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the proton is at rest? Or perhaps both are moving but the antiproton's speed is low. Alternatively, perhaps in the center-of-momentum frame, but given that the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe the initial frame is where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, but in any case, the initial total energy and momentum must equal the final's. So I need to set up the conservation equations.

Let me list what I know:

- The proton and antiproton are annihilating into 2A⁺ and 2A⁻.
- The antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is much less than its rest
