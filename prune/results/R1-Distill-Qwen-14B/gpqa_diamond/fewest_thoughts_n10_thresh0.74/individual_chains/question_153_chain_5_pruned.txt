Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question presents three separate reactions, each of which is a Michael addition. The task is to determine the major products for each and then choose the correct option from A to D based on the given choices.

Let's break it down one by one.

First, the reactions:

1. Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH → A
2. Reaction (B): 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile + MeOH, H3O+ → B
3. Reaction (C): C + but-3-en-2-one + KOH, H2O → 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione

Wait, no, in the third reaction, I think the arrow is pointing from C + but-3-en-2-one to the product. So C is the other reactant. Hmm, maybe I should look at each reaction separately.

Starting with Reaction (A):

The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). So sodium ethoxide is a strong base, likely deprotonating the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a diester, so it's a good Michael donor because it can form a resonance-stabilized enolate.

Wait, but the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack by the enolate on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the Michael acceptor). So in this case, which is the donor and which is the acceptor?

Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups, so it's a good Michael donor. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, making it a good Michael acceptor.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Let's imagine the structure of the acrylate: it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent on the alpha (the E configuration, so the p-tolyl is on the opposite side of the double bond).

Wait, the acrylate is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no. Let me think. The formula is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the CH2. No, wait, the numbering might be different. The formula would be (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-t
