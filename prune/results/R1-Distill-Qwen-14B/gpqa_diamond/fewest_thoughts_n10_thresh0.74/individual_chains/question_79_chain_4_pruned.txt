Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let's see what the question says.

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, used for elimination reactions or maybe as a catalyst. Wait, isn't that something used in the Birch reduction or maybe for epoxide ring-opening? Hmm, not too sure. Or wait, maybe it's a bulky base used for certain eliminations... Like in the formation of epoxides from alcohols? Or maybe it's involved in some kind of ring-opening? I'm a bit fuzzy on that, but let's think about the reaction conditions.

The product's NMR is given. Let me look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, in the proton NMR, I see two singlets integrating to 3H each. Singlets mean no neighboring protons. So maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have adjacent Hs. Like, maybe two CH3 groups attached to something like a carbonyl or an electronegative atom. Or perhaps they're on aromatic rings but in positions where they don't have neighboring Hs. Wait, but styrene derivatives usually have substituents in certain positions.

Then there's a doublet at 6.75 (1H). The next is a doublet at 7.08 (2H), then another doublet at 7.68 (1H), and another at 7.71 (2H). Hmm, this looks like a pattern from an aromatic system with substituents leading to coupling between protons.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- δ 21.3 (1C, s) – that's a small upfield value, maybe a CH3 attached to something like an oxygen or a carbonyl.
- 28.4 (1C, s) – another CH3, perhaps.
- 126.9 (2C, s) – aromatic carbons.
- 127.1 (1C, s) – another aromatic.
- 129.1 (2C, s) – aromatic probably.
- 130.3 (1C, s) – maybe a quaternary carbon in the aromatic ring.
- 141.5 (1C, s) – that's a high value, maybe a carbonyl or an oxygenated carbon like an epoxide.
- 144.1 (1C, s) – another high value, maybe another carbonyl or a substituted aromatic.
- 197.7 (1C, s) – that's a very high shift, definitely a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. Wait, but in epoxides, the carbons are around 50-70 ppm, so maybe this isn't an epoxide.

Wait, but the product's formula isn't given. Hmm, but the starting material is C11H12O. Let's think about the reaction. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Oh, wait, that's a strong, bulky base. It's used in the formation of epoxides via the Prilezhaev oxidation, maybe? Or is it used in acid catalysis? Hmm, another thought: sometimes, for epoxide openings, especially under certain conditions with bases, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction is ring-opening of an epoxide. Wait, but the product's NMR doesn't seem to show an epoxide. Let me think. Epoxide protons typically show up between 3-4 ppm as multiplets, but in the 1H NMR given, I don't see such signals. So perhaps the product isn't an epoxide. Or maybe the reaction isn't about epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening via nucleophilic attack. Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, so perhaps the reaction is deprotonation leading to elimination. Or maybe it's a ring-closing metathesis? Not
