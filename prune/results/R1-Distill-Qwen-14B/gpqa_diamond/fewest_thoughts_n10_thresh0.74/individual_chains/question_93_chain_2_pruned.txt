Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this qPCR question. Let me read it carefully again.

So, the scientist did a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, which I think means perfect efficiency, so each cycle halves the target. The RÂ² is 1, so the curve fits perfectly. The slope is -3.3. 

Wait, what's the slope in qPCR? I remember that the formula for the slope is based on log vs. Ct. Oh right, the equation is usually y = mx + b, where y is Ct, and x is log(copy number). So the slope would be -3.32 because that's the expected value for a 100% efficient PCR (since each 10-fold increase in copies reduces Ct by about 3.32 cycles). So the slope here is -3.3, which is close enough to -3.32, maybe due to rounding or something. So the efficiency part seems correct.

Looking at the data provided:

100000 copies: Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. Average would be around 34.2 or so.

10000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average about 30.9.

1000: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average around 27.6.

100: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Average 24.3.

10: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Average 21.

Wait, but these are the triplicates. Each dilution is a ten-fold lower than the previous. Since the efficiency is 100%, each ten-fold should decrease Ct by about 3.32 cycles. Let's see the differences between the averages.

Between 100000 and 10000: 34.2 minus 30.9 is 3.3. That's exactly what's expected. Similarly, 30.9 to 27.6 is 3.3. 27.6 to 24.3 is 3.3. 24.3 to 21 is 3.3. So each ten-fold dilution drops Ct by 3.3 cycles, which matches the slope of the curve. 

So the data seems consistent. So what's the question asking? The question is, "Which of the following explains the discrepancies in his results?" Wait, the question says that the results are as follows, but all the data seems to fit the expected 3.3 Ct difference per ten-fold. So perhaps the question is referring to the technical replicates within each dilution.

Looking at each set of triplicates:

At 100000, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34
