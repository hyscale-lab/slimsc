Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, the IR data. There are bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. Since the molecular formula has two oxygen atoms, maybe an ester or amide?

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm triplet (t, 3H) – that's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl ester. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons, so maybe the ethyl is attached to something else, like an oxygen in an ester group.

4.0 ppm broad singlet (bs, 2H) – broad suggests maybe an NH group, but wait, in the IR we saw possible N-H. Alternatively, it could be an OCH2 group, but I'm not certain.

4.5 ppm quartet (q, 2H) – quartet with 2H, likely a CH2 connected to an oxygen. Since it's a quartet, perhaps it's next to another CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3. Wait, the ethyl group in an ester would have the OCH2CH3. So the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2, and the triplet at 1.2 is the CH2CH3. That seems consistent.

Then, there's 7.0 ppm doublet (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm doublet (d, 2H). Those are likely aromatic protons. Two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. For example, in a para-substituted benzamide or ester.

Putting this together, the structure likely has an ethyl ester group (from the NMR data) and a benzamide or similar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at the meta position. But wait, the NMR shows a triplet and quartet which would be ethyl, but for an ethoxy group, the OCH2CH3 would have protons around 4.0 as a quartet. But in this option, the ethoxy is at position 3, so maybe the aromatic protons would be different. Also, the IR has N-H (amide) and carbonyl. So the IR matches, but the NMR... let's think.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure would be formamide (HCONH-) attached to 4-ethoxyphenyl. The ethoxy group would be at para position. Let's see. The ethoxy group's OCH2CH3 would have protons around 1.2 (CH3) as triplet and
