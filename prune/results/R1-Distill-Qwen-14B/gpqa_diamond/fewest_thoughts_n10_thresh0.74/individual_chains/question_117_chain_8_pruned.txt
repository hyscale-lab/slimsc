Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... that's when a compound has chiral centers and can rotate plane-polarized light, right? So I need to look for compounds that have at least one chiral center.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. The substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'. Wait, but the main thing is whether there's a chiral center. Do these substituents create any asymmetric carbon atoms? Let me think. Each of the carbons attached to the oxygen in the ester groups... Are those carbons connected to four different groups? If the substituents are in the 2 and 6 positions on each ring, but since it's a biphenyl, maybe the arrangement leads to some symmetry. Wait, but the molecule itself: the ester groups are at 2 and 2' positions, so the carbons attached to the ester oxygens are each connected to two methyl groups, two ester oxygens, and maybe other substituents. Wait, no, the formula is dimethyl, so each ester is OMe. So each ester is OMe attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the biphenyl ring. So the carbons in the ester groups: each would be CH2O, but wait no, the structure is something like O-C-O with the methyl groups. Maybe the carbons in the ester groups are connected in such a way that they are not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl itself allows some kind of stereoisomerism, but I'm not sure that leads to optical isomerism. Wait, maybe if the two substituents on each ring are in a certain position that creates a planar structure, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the substituents on each ring are in positions that lead to no chiral centers. I'm not certain about this one, so I'll come back.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO, but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO- methyl ester. Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-; but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. No, wait: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)COHCH2COOH? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon in the middle, the one attached to the OH, is connected to: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3, and another CH2 (wait no, wait structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the one with OH) is connected to:

- OH group,
- the CH2 connected to COOCH3,
- another CH2 group (from the other side),
- and the CH2 on the other side?

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon of propanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2(OH)â€”wait, no, the central carbon is the one with OH. So that carbon is connected to:
