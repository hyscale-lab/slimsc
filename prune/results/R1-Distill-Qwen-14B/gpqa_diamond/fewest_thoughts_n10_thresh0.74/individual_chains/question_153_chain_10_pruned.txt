Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem about Michael additions, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacts with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). From what I remember, the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound (the Michael acceptor) by an enolate ion. The enolate acts as the nucleophile.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl ester of malonic acid. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it should deprotonate to form an enolate. Wait, but malonate is already a diester, so maybe it's the conjugate base that's the nucleophile. The enolate would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 (if the ester is at carbon 1). So the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a substituent at the 3 position, which is p-tolyl. Wait, no, maybe it's more like CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3 with the p-tolyl at the CH2=CH part? Or wait, the formula is methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but the structure might be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2COOEt? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt. Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2=
