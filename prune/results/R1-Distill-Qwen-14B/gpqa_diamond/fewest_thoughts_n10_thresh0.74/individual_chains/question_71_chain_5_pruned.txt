Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the setup says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variations, right? But I don't think that's super relevant here because the question is more about their orbital periods and temperatures.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is double that, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, and so on. I need to find the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—oh, right! The formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is T = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * D^2 )) )^(1/4), but wait, I think there's a simpler version when comparing planets around the same star. 

Oh, right! If all the planets are orbiting the same star (same L and sigma), then the equilibrium temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance. The formula simplifies to T ∝ (1 / sqrt(D)), where D is the distance from the star. But wait, since the orbital periods are given in a ratio, we can relate that to the distance using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a). So, P² ∝ a³. Since all the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius of the orbit, so a is proportional to D.

So, for each planet, their distances cubed are proportional to their periods squared. Let me write that down. P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.

Wait, but wait, Kepler's law says P² is proportional to a³. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). Therefore, the distance of each planet from the star is proportional to their period raised to the power of (2/3).

So, to find the ratio of distances between Planet_4 and Planet_2, I need to take (P4/P2)^(2/3). 

Let me compute that. P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So 3.5 / 2 is 1.75. Then, (1.75)^(2/3). Hmm, what's 1.75 to the power 2/3? Let me think. 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3) is the same as [ (7/4)^(1/3) ] squared.

I remember that cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 8 is 2. 7/4 is 1.75, which is less than 2, so cube root would be a little less than 1.26 (since 1.26^3 is about 2). Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to compute logarithmically.

Alternatively, I can write 1.75 as (7/4) = (7^(1/3)) / (4^(1/3)). But maybe I should compute the actual value.

Alternatively, I can use exponents. Let's compute (3.5/2)^(2/3) = (1.75)^(2/3). Let's compute 1.75^(2/3). 

I can think of it as e^[(2/3) * ln(1.75)]. Let me compute ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by 2/3: (2/3)*0.5596 ≈ 0.373. Then e^0.37
