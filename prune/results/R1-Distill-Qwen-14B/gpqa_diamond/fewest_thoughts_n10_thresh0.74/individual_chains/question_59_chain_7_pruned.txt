Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me try to think it through carefully.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH (which is acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, that sounds like a titration problem where acids and bases are reacting. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other, so the first step is probably to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- ions.

Let me break it down. First, I'll calculate the moles of each component. 

Starting with CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But when calculating the moles, I just need the concentration times volume. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. So moles = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. But since it's a weak acid, I'll remember that it contributes some H+ ions, but maybe not all of them are dissociated. But for the initial calculation, perhaps I can treat it as a strong acid, but wait, no, HCl is a strong acid, so maybe the H+ from the acids and the OH- from the Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other first. Oh wait, but then the excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but the Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 produces 2 moles of OH- ions because it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So first, let me compute the moles of each acid and base.

1. CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol.
2. HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.
3. Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH, being a weak acid, only partially dissociates, so it won't contribute as much H+ as the 0.05 mol would suggest. But I'm not sure if I should include that in the neutralization or not. Maybe I should first calculate the total H+ and OH- from the strong acid and strong base.

So the strong acids here are HCl and CH3COOH (but I'm not sure if I should treat CH3COOH as a strong acid. No, wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully ionize. So perhaps when calculating the H+ from the acids, only the HCl contributes fully, and the CH3COOH contributes some H+, but maybe the reaction between the strong acid and the base will be more significant. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let's consider all the H+ and OH- ions. The strong acid (HCl) will release 0.08 mol of H+. The weak acid (CH3COOH) will release some H+ but perhaps not as much as 0.05 mol. Then, the base Ba(OH)2 will contribute 0.18 mol of OH-.

But when you mix these, the OH- will react with H+ from all sources. So the neutralization
