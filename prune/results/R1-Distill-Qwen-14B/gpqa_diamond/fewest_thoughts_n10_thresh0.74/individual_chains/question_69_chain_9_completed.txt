Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The given energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can appear longer when they're moving at relativistic speeds. That's due to time dilation from special relativity. The lifetime observed (the mean lifetime) is gamma times the proper lifetime, τ. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

Gamma is equal to E/mc², right? Oh wait, since E is given as 27 GeV and the mass is 3.41 GeV, I can calculate gamma as E/(m c²), but since the units are the same, it's just 27 / 3.41 approximately.

Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41*8 is 27.28. Wait, so 3.41 * 8 is about 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 8. So gamma is around 8.

So the observed lifetime τ is gamma * τ₀. So τ = 8 * 8e-16 s = 64e-16 s, which is 6.4e-15 seconds. Wait, no, wait. 8 times 8e-16 is 64e-16, which is 6.4e-15 seconds. Hmm, okay.

Now, the next thing is that the particle's lifetime determines how far it travels before decaying. The distance it travels is v * τ. But wait, to find the minimum resolution, I think we need to relate the velocity and the lifetime to find the distance, and then find the minimum distance such that at least 30% of decays are observed. Or wait, perhaps it's about the length that the particle travels before decaying.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. How does the resolution come into play? Oh, right, the Bubble Chamber's resolution is the smallest distance it can measure. So if the particle travels a certain average distance, the resolution must be less than that distance to detect the decay.

Wait, the probability that a particle decays is given by 1 - e^(-t/tau). But t is the time the particle exists, which in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0. But the distance it travels is v * gamma tau_0.

Alternatively, the mean path length is L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0. Because beta is v/c, so L = (gamma beta c) * tau_0.

Wait, but beta is v/c. Hmm. Gamma is E/(m c²). Since E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV/c², so gamma is 27/(3.41) ≈8.

So, to find beta, perhaps we can use the relation between beta and gamma. I remember that gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). Rearranging, beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So with gamma≈8, beta² is 1 - (1/64) = 63/64. So beta is sqrt(63/64) = sqrt(63)/8. Let's compute that. sqrt(63) is about 7.937, so 7.937/8≈0.9921. So beta is roughly 0.9921.

So the mean path length L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Let me compute that. c is approximately 3e8 m/s. tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = 8 * 0.9921 * 3e8 m/s * 8e-16 s.

Let me compute step by step. 8 * 0.9921 ≈7.9368. Multiply by 3e8: 7.9368 * 3e8 = 2.381e9. Then multiply by 8e-16: 2.381e9 * 8e-16 = (2.381 *8) * 1e-7. 2.381*8 is about 19.048. So 19.048e-7 meters. Which is 1.9048e-6 meters, approximately 1.9048e-6 meters.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, right, because if the path length is too small, the chamber might not resolve it. So the resolution must be less than the mean path length multiplied by some factor to account for the detection probability.

Wait, the question says "at least 30%". Hmm, so I think the probability that the decay is observed is when the path length is greater than the resolution. Or perhaps the minimum length such that the probability is >=30%.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the proper decay length. The decay length is L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0. So the average distance the particle travels before decaying is L. So to have a 30% chance of observing the decay, perhaps the resolution must be such that the decay length is at least a certain fraction of L.

Wait no, the detection is about the chamber's ability to see the decay vertex. So the minimum resolution (like the smallest feature it can detect) must be such that the particle's decay path is longer than that. If the decay length is much longer than the resolution, the decay vertex can be detected. But if the decay length is smaller than the resolution, you can't see it.

Wait, perhaps the probability of observing the decay is proportional to the ratio of the bubble chamber's resolution to the decay length. Because if the particles decay over a distance smaller than the resolution, you can't tell where they decayed, so you can't observe it.

Ah, right! The probability P that the decay is observed is given by (delta / L), where delta is the decay length. Because if the decay occurs over a length delta, and the chamber has a resolution (minimum detectable length) of L, then the chance that the decay occurs within that L is delta/L.

Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. The chance that the decay is observed (i.e., that the decay vertex is detected) depends on the relative size of the decay length compared to the chamber's resolution. Suppose the chamber can only resolve decay lengths longer than a certain delta. If the decay length is longer than delta, you can see it. If it's shorter, you can't.

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to model it as the decay length being the average distance. If the resolution is R, then the probability of seeing the decay is the probability that the decay occurs within a region of size R. Since the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability that the decay occurs within a distance R is 1 - e^(-R/L), where L is the mean decay length.

Wait, yes, that's right. The decay probability as a function of distance x is (1/L) e^(-x/L). So the probability that the decay occurs within a distance R is the integral from 0 to R of (1/L) e^(-x/L) dx, which is 1 - e^(-R/L).

So the problem states that we need this probability to be at least 30% (0.3). So:

1 - e^(-R/L) >= 0.3

Which implies:

e^(-R/L) <= 0.7

Taking natural logarithm:

-R/L <= ln(0.7)

Multiply both sides by -1 (and reverse inequality):

R/L >= -ln(0.7)

Compute ln(0.7): approximately ln(0.7) ≈ -0.35667.

So,

R >= L * 0.35667

So, R is the minimum resolution needed. So we need to compute L, then multiply by 0.35667 to get R.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the logic. The observation is possible when the decay occurs within a region of size R, so the probability is 1 - e^(-R/L). We want this probability to be at least 30%, so 1 - e^(-R/L) >= 0.3 → e^(-R/L) <= 0.7 → -R/L <= ln(0.7) → R/L >= ln(1/0.7) = ln(10/7) ≈ 0.35667.

Yes, correct.

So first, compute L, which is gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Earlier, I found L ≈ 1.9048e-6 meters. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute gamma: 27 / 3.41 → let me calculate it precisely.

3.41 *8 = 27.28 → so 27 /3.41 = approx 8. (Wait, 3.41 *7.92 = 27? Let me compute 3.41 *7.92:

3.41 *7 = 23.87

3.41 *0.92 = 3.41 *0.9=3.069, plus 3.41 *0.02=0.0682 → 3.1372.

So total 23.87 +3.1372=27.0072. So 3.41 *7.92 ≈27. So gamma is approximately 7.92.

So let me recalculate L with more precise gamma and beta.

Gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 /3.41 = approx 7.917.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Compute 1/gamma²: 1/(7.917)^2 → about 1/(62.68) ≈0.01595.

So 1 - 0.01595 = 0.98405 → sqrt(0.98405) ≈0.99198.

So beta ≈0.99198.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Compute each term:

gamma=7.917, beta=0.99198 → product is 7.917 * 0.99198 ≈7.854.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.854 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.854 *3e8 = 2.3562e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3562e9 *8e-16 = 2.3562*8 *1e-7 = 18.8496e-7 m → 1.88496e-6 m.

So L≈1.885e-6 meters.

Then, R >= L * 0.35667.

So R=1.885e-6 m * 0.35667 ≈ approx (1.885 * 0.35667) *1e-6.

Compute 1.885 *0.35667:

0.35667 *2=0.71334, but 1.885 is about 1.885.

Let me compute 1.885 * 0.35667:

Multiply 1.8 *0.35667=0.642006

0.08 *0.35667=0.0285336

0.005 *0.35667=0.00178335.

Add together:

0.642006 + 0.0285336=0.6705396 +0.00178335=0.672323.

So R≈0.672323e-6 m → 6.723e-7 m → approx 6.72e-7 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. Hmm, but wait, none of the options are around 6.7e-7. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the numbers. Maybe I messed up gamma or beta.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought gamma is 27/3.41≈8, but a more precise calculation gave 7.917. Let me recompute.

Wait, 3.41 * 7.92 is about 27, so gamma is 27/3.41=7.917.

Hmm, so L was 1.885e-6 m.

Wait, so R= 1.885e-6 m *0.35667≈6.72e-7 m. So 6.72e-7 m is 6.72e-7 m=672 nm.

But the options given are:

A) 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)

B) 2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)

C) 2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)

D) 2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Hmm, so none of the options match 6.7e-7 m. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the way I computed R is wrong. Wait, R is the minimum resolution, which is the minimum length that the chamber can resolve. The decay length is L, and the probability of detecting the decay is P=1 - exp(-R/L). So to achieve P=0.3, we need R >= L * ln(1/(1-P)).

Wait, ln(1/(1-0.3))= ln(1/0.7)=approx 0.35667. So R = L * 0.35667.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate R as L multiplied by this factor. So L is 1.885e-6 m, so R=1.885e-6 *0.35667 ≈6.72e-7 m, which is 0.672e-6 m. So 6.72e-7 m is 0.672 micrometers. But looking at the options, option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is about three times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, let's recompute L.

L = gamma * beta * c * tau0.

gamma ≈7.917, beta≈0.992.

So gamma*beta =7.917 *0.992 ≈7.865.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So L =7.865 * 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7.

Multiply by 7.865: 7.865 * 2.4e-7 = 18.876e-7 m =1.8876e-6 m.

So L≈1.8876e-6 m.

Then R = 1.8876e-6 * 0.35667 ≈6.72e-7 m.

Hmm, same as before, which is about 0.672e-6 m or 672e-9 m.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing a step.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the proper time? Or maybe I should be using the lab frame time.

Wait, another approach: The mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau0.

Then, the mean path length is v * tau_lab, where v is the velocity.

Wait, so v = beta c. So the mean path length L = beta c * gamma tau0 = gamma beta c tau0.

Which is the same as I computed before.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma and beta.

Wait, let me calculate gamma more accurately.

gamma = E/(m c²) = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV = 27 /3.41 ≈7.9179.

Yes.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

Compute 1/gamma^2: (7.9179)^2 = approximately 62.69.

1/62.69 ≈0.01595.

1 - 0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=approx 0.99199.

So beta≈0.9920.

So gamma*beta =7.9179 *0.9920≈7.865.

So L=7.865 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Wait, 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7.

7.865 *2.4e-7=18.876e-7 m=1.8876e-6 m.

So L is correct.

Now, R = L * ln(1/(1-0.3)) = L * ln(1/0.7) ≈L *0.35667.

So R≈1.8876e-6 *0.35667≈6.72e-7 m=6.72e-7 m=672e-9 m.

But the options are way off. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. But that's three times larger than our calculated R.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the formula for P?

Wait, another approach: the probability P that a decay is observed is given by the fraction of the time the particle spends within a region of length R. For an exponential distribution, P=1 - e^(-R/L).

We want P>=0.3, so 1 - e^(-R/L)>=0.3 → e^(-R/L)<=0.7 → -R/L <= ln(0.7) → R/L >= ln(1/0.7)=0.35667.

So R >= 0.35667 * L.

So R =0.35667 * L.

Wait, but perhaps I should use L as the mean decay length, which is the same as the calculation.

But given that, R is 0.35667 * L ≈0.35667 * 1.8876e-6 m ≈6.72e-7 m. So 6.72e-7 m is 672 nanometers.

But the options are all way larger or smaller. So perhaps I'm missing a crucial point.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the proper formula is R = L * (1 - e^(-R/L)) ?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the decay length is L=gamma beta c tau. Wait, wait, perhaps tau is the mean lifetime, which is gamma tau_0.

Wait, no, no, because tau is gamma tau_0. So L= v tau = beta c gamma tau_0.

Which is what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the energy given is the total energy, which includes the rest mass.

Yes, because E=gamma m c². So E=27 GeV, m c²=3.41 GeV → gamma=E/(m c²)=27/3.41≈7.917.

So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the minimum resolution to detect 30% of the decays, but about the minimum resolution R such that the number of observed decays is at least 30% of the total.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again. The number of particles that decay within a length R is given by (1 - e^(-R/L)) times the total number. So we need (1 - e^(-R/L)) >=0.3.

Which is what I did.

But given that, the calculation leads to R≈6.72e-7 m, but the options don't have such a value. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of L.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of L.

Wait, gamma =27/3.41 = approximately 7.9179.

Beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(7.9179)^2)).

Let me calculate that with more precision.

Compute 7.9179^2: 7.9179 *7.9179.

Compute 7 *7=49, 7*0.9179=6.4253, 0.9179 *7=6.4253, 0.9179^2≈0.8425.

Wait, perhaps a better way: (7.9179)^2 = (8 -0.0821)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.0821 + (0.0821)^2 ≈64 -1.3136 + 0.00674≈62.6931.

So 1/gamma^2 = 1/62.6931≈0.01595.

1 -0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)= approximately 0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

So gamma * beta =7.9179 *0.9920= approximately 7.865.

So L=7.865 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 = 24e-8 m =2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.865: 7.865 *2.4e-7 = 18.876e-7 m=1.8876e-6 m.

So L=1.8876e-6 m.

So R=0.35667 *1.8876e-6 = approx 6.72e-7 m.

Hmm. So, but the options are much larger or smaller.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate L in meters correctly.

Ah! Wait, wait, perhaps my calculation for L is in meters, but maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Let me recompute the numbers step by step.

gamma=7.9179, beta=0.9920.

gamma*beta=7.9179 *0.9920 =7.865.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

L =7.865 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.865: 7.865 *2.4e-7 = let's compute 7 *2.4e-7=1.68e-6, 0.865 *2.4e-7=approximately 2.076e-7.

So 1.68e-6 + 2.076e-7 =1.8876e-6 m.

So L=1.8876e-6 m.

We need R=0.35667 * L=0.35667 *1.8876e-6 = let's compute 1.8876e-6 *0.35667.

0.3 *1.8876e-6=5.6628e-7.

0.05667 *1.8876e-6 → approximately 0.05667 *1.8876e-6 = approximately 1.068e-7.

So total R≈5.6628e-7 +1.068e-7=6.7308e-7 m.

So 6.73e-7 m = 673e-9 m, which is 673 nanometers.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is A)2.08e-6 m, which is about 3 times larger. So what's happening here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong value for the mean path length. Maybe I should compute the speed in terms of the rest mass and energy.

Wait, another approach: The speed v can be found from the energy.

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)².

So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 ) ) / c.

But E =27 GeV, m c²=3.41 GeV.

So E²=27²=729 (GeV)^2.

(m c²)^2= (3.41)^2≈11.628 GeV².

So (pc c)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2 =729 -11.628=717.372 GeV².

So pc = sqrt(717.372) GeV ≈26.784 GeV.

So p =26.784 GeV /c.

Then, beta = pc/(E) = (26.784 GeV/c )/(27 GeV) ) → beta =26.784/27 ≈0.99199.

Which matches our earlier calculation.

Gamma is E/(m c²) →27/3.41≈7.917.

So everything checks out.

So why is my calculated R not matching any of the options?

Looking at the options again:

A)2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers)

B)2.08e-9 m (2.08 nanometers)

C)2.08e-1 m (20.8 cm)

D)2.08e-3 m (2.08 mm)

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R.

Wait, the equation is R = L * (1 - e^(-R/L)) ?

Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct probability P observed is P = 1 - e^(-R/L).

We set P=0.3, so 1 - e^(-R/L)=0.3 → e^(-R/L)=0.7 → -R/L=ln(0.7) → R= L * (-ln(0.7)).

Which is R= L * 0.35667.

Wait, perhaps I should compute L again with more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute L again.

gamma=27/3.41=7.917857.

beta= sqrt(1 - (1/(7.917857)^2)).

Compute 7.917857^2:

= (7.917857)^2 = (approx) 62.69.

So 1/(62.69)=0.01595.

1-0.01595=0.98405.

sqrt(0.98405)=approx 0.9920.

So beta=0.9920.

gamma*beta=7.917857 *0.9920=7.86486.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.86486 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

So 3e8 *8e-16 =24e-8 m=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.86486: 7.86486 *2.4e-7 = 18.875664e-7 m=1.8875664e-6 m.

So L=1.8875664e-6 m.

R=0.35667 *1.8875664e-6 ≈6.72e-7 m.

But the options don't have that.

Wait a second, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would require the resolution to be less than or equal to R= L * ln(2), which is about 0.693 L. But 0.35667 is less than 0.693, so the required R is smaller than that.

Wait, but the options don't have anything close. So perhaps I have to re-examine the problem.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done without considering the velocity factor, or perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, let me compute L again in different units.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

gamma=7.917.

beta=0.992.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau0.

=7.917 *0.992 *3e8 *8e-16.

Let me compute each part:

7.917 *0.992 → approx 7.86.

3e8 *8e-16 → 24e-8 m.

So 7.86 *24e-8 = 188.64e-8 m=1.8864e-6 m.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual numerical value of R=0.35667 *1.8864e-6.

0.35667 *1.8864e-6 = ?

Let me compute 1.8864 *0.35667.

1.8864 *0.3 =0.56592

1.8864 *0.05=0.09432

1.8864 *0.00667≈0.01257.

Adding them: 0.56592 +0.09432=0.66024 +0.01257=0.67281.

So 0.67281e-6 m=6.7281e-7 m=0.67281 micrometers.

Which is about 673 nm.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the given energy is 27 GeV per particle, but perhaps it's the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh wait, no, because E is given as 27 GeV, which generally includes the rest mass. But if it's kinetic energy, that's different.

Wait, if E is the kinetic energy, then total energy would be E_kinetic + m c^2.

But the problem says "energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV", which probably refers to the total energy of the particle.

But perhaps I should double-check. If E is the kinetic energy, then E_k = (gamma -1 ) m c².

So, E_k =27 GeV, m c²=3.41 GeV.

So gamma -1 =27 /3.41 → gamma=1 + (27/3.41) → 27/3.41≈7.917, so gamma=8.917.

Wait, that's a big difference. So gamma would be approximately 8.917.

Then, beta would be sqrt(1 -1/(gamma^2))=sqrt(1-1/(8.917)^2).

Compute (8.917)^2: approx 79.5.

So 1/79.5≈0.01258.

1-0.01258=0.98742.

sqrt(0.98742)= about 0.9937.

So beta=0.9937.

Gamma * beta=8.917 *0.9937≈8.863.

Then, L=8.863 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 8.863: 8.863 *2.4e-7=21.271e-7 m=2.1271e-6 m.

Then R=0.35667 *2.1271e-6 = approx 0.758e-6 m=7.58e-7 m.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

The given options are multiples of 2.08e-something. Let's see, 2.08 is about 0.35667 *5.816. Hmm, so perhaps 2.08e-6 is 5.816 times 0.35667e-6.

Wait, 2.08e-6 =0.35667e-6 *5.828.

Wait, but I can't see why that would be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with L=gamma * c * tau0 (without beta).

In that case, L=7.917 *3e8 *8e-16 = 7.917 *24e-8= 1.899e-6 m.

Then, R=0.35667 *1.899e-6= approx 6.74e-7 m.

Still the same.

Hmm, perhaps the options are not matching because the given mass is in GeV, and I should have used different units.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in particle physics, mass is often given in MeV/c². Wait, but the problem states it's 3.41 GeV, which is 3410 MeV.

Wait, perhaps the calculation was done using natural units where c=1, but then converted to meters.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, so L = gamma * beta * tau_0.

But tau_0 is in seconds, so you have to convert to meters.

Wait, but perhaps the calculation was done differently. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The distance L is gamma * beta c * tau0.

But perhaps the tau0 is given in the rest frame, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma*tau0.

So the time the particle lives is t = gamma tau0.

Distance L= v t = beta c * gamma tau0.

Which is what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value of L and R more precisely.

Let me compute L more accurately.

gamma=27/3.41=7.91785714.

beta=sqrt(1 - 1/(7.91785714)^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/62.692)) = sqrt(0.98405)=approx 0.9920.

So L = gamma * beta * c * tau0.

gamma*beta=7.91785714 *0.9920=7.865.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So L=7.865 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

7.865 *2.4e-7= approx 1.8876e-6 m.

So L=1.8876e-6 m.

R=0.35667 *1.8876e-6= approx 6.72e-7 m.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the minimum resolution is the full width at 30% of the maximum, perhaps using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed of light multiplied by the lifetime.

Wait, if I compute L = c * tau_lab.

tau_lab= gamma tau0=7.917857 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

So L = c * tau_lab= 3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s= 1.9002e-6 m.

R=0.35667 *1.9002e-6= approx 6.78e-7 m.

Same as before.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the proper time, but no, the question states that tau0 is the proper lifetime.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done with gamma=27/3.41=8, exactly.

Then, gamma=8, beta= sqrt(1-1/64)=sqrt(63/64)=sqrt(0.984375)= approx 0.9921567.

So gamma*beta=8 *0.9921567=7.9372536.

L=7.9372536 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16=24e-8=2.4e-7 m.

Multiply by 7.9372536 →7.9372536 *2.4e-7 =19.0494e-7 m=1.90494e-6 m.

R=0.35667 *1.90494e-6= approx 6.79e-7 m.

Still same.

Hmm.

Wait, what if I consider that the minimum number of decays observed is 30%, which is 0.3, so P=0.3.

But perhaps the problem is using a different approach, maybe using the velocity as a fraction of c, and calculating the mean path length as L=gamma * beta c tau0.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the mean lifetime and find the distance that 30% of the particles have decayed, which would be the L*(1 - e^-0.3) or something else.

No, the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done without considering the natural logarithm correctly. Let me compute ln(0.7) more accurately.

ln(0.7)=-0.356674943935.

So R= L *0.356674943935.

But even with more precise calculation, the R is still about 6.73e-7 m.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation.

Wait, 27 GeV /3.41 GeV =27 /3.41=7.9179.

Yes, correct.

Beta is sqrt(1-1/gamma^2)=sqrt(1-1/62.69)=sqrt(0.98405)=0.9920.

Yes.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the proper lifetime is given, and the question is about the proper decay length, but that doesn't make sense because decay length depends on gamma.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using tau_0 as the lab frame lifetime. No, the problem says tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Hmm. I'm stuck because the calculated R is not matching any of the options. Perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options, the only option close to the same order of magnitude is A, which is 2.08e-6 m. Which is about three times larger than our calculated R.

Wait, perhaps the calculation was done with gamma=8 exactly, and beta=sqrt(63/64)=sqrt(0.984375)= approx 0.9921567.

So gamma=8, beta=0.9921567.

L=gamma*beta*c*tau0=8 *0.9921567 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 8*0.9921567=7.9372536.

3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

7.9372536 *2.4e-7=1.90494e-6 m.

R=0.35667 *1.90494e-6= approx 6.79e-7 m.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done as R= L * ln(2), which is about 0.693, but that's for 63% probability, which is higher than 30%.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be L multiplied by 0.3 instead of 0.35667, which would give R=0.3 *1.887e-6=5.66e-7 m.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done without considering the 0.35667 factor. For example, perhaps the problem expects the R to be equal to L multiplied by 0.3, but that doesn't align with the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for R. Maybe the formula should be R= L * (1 - e^(-R/L)), and I have to solve for R.

But that would require solving a transcendental equation, which isn't straightforward.

Wait, perhaps for small R, e^(-R/L) can be approximated as 1 - R/L. So 1 - (1 - R/L) >=0.3 → R/L >=0.3 → R=0.3 L.

But that would give R=0.3 *1.887e-6=5.66e-7 m, which is still not matching any option.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation of the mean path length, not the R. But the mean path length is L=1.887e-6 m, which is 1.887 micrometers. But the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2 micrometers. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute L and choose the closest option, which would be option A)2.08e-6 m.

But I'm not sure why my calculation is off. Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute L=gamma * beta * c * tau_0, with gamma=8, beta= sqrt(63/64)=sqrt(0.984375)= ~0.9921567.

So, gamma=8, beta=0.9921567.

L=8 *0.9921567 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 8 *0.9921567=7.9372536.

3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

7.9372536 *2.4e-7=1.90494e-6 m.

So L=1.90494e-6 m.

Then R= (1.90494e-6 m) *0.35667= approx 6.79e-7 m.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the question is inverting gamma and beta. Let me try that.

No, L is definitely gamma*beta*c*tau_0.

Another thought: Perhaps the energy is given in units where c=1, so when converting to meters, I should multiply by c in m/s.

Wait, no, I think I did that correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done using beta = v/c, and gamma is E/(m c²). So perhaps I made a mistake in units.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the numerical value of L.

gamma=7.917857, beta=0.9920.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau_0=8e-16 s.

So,

L=7.917857 *0.9920 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *8e-16 =2.4e-7 m.

7.917857 *0.9920=7.865.

7.865 *2.4e-7=1.8876e-6 m.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A)2.08e-6 m. But how?

Wait, 2.08e-6 m is approximately 2.08 micrometers.

Which is 2.08e-6 m.

Comparing to our calculated L=1.887e-6 m, which is 1.887 micrometers.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be L, not R.

But the question asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays, which is R=0.35667 * L.

But if the options don't have that, perhaps the problem is considering the entire decay length L, not the R required.

But that would be the mean path length, which is 1.887e-6 m. The closest option is A)2.08e-6 m.

But why would the answer be option A?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error earlier. Let me recompute L.

Wait, compute gamma * beta =7.917857 *0.9920=7.865.

Then, 7.865 *3e8= 2.3595e9.

Multiply by tau_0=8e-16: 2.3595e9 *8e-16= 1.8876e-6 m.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the proper decay length, which is beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the proper decay length, but no, because proper time is tau_0.

Wait, the problem says "the proper lifetime of X⁰ is tau0=8e-16 s."

So the lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0.

The decay length is v gamma tau0.

Which is beta c gamma tau0.

But I've done that.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A)2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in a different way.

Wait, another approach: The proper lifetime is tau_0=8e-16 s.

The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau_0.

The mean path length is L= beta c gamma tau_0.

But perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe the decay, which is when the decay length is larger than the resolution.

So, the probability is P=1 - e^(-R/L).

Set P=0.3.

So, R= L * ln(1/(1-0.3))= L *0.35667.

So, R=0.35667 * L.

But I can't find an option that matches this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, meaning that the resolution should be such that 30% of the particles decay within that resolution. So maybe R is L * (1 - e^(-R/L)), which equals 0.3.

Wait, but solving that equation for R is tricky. Let me try assuming R=0.3 L.

Then P=1 - e^(-0.3 L / L)=1 - e^(-0.3) ≈1 -0.7408=0.2592, which is about 25.9%, less than 30%.

Hmm, not enough.

If I set R=0.35667 L, then P=0.3, which is the required.

So, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the options don't have the right value.

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option A)2.08e-6 m, which is approximately 2.08 micrometers.

But wait, 2.08e-6 m is about 2.08 micrometers, which is about 1.1 times our calculated L=1.887e-6 m.

But why would the answer be option A?

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done without considering beta, which would make L=gamma * c * tau0.

gamma=7.9179.

c=3e8 m/s.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So,

L=7.9179 *3e8 *8e-16 = 7.9179 *2.4e-7= 1.9003e-6 m.

Then R=0.35667 *1.9003e-6=6.79e-7 m.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the minimum resolution to be the mean decay length, not considering the probability. So the answer would be L=1.9e-6 m, which is closest to option A)2.08e-6 m.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with gamma=27/3.41=8, which gives L= gamma * beta * c * tau0.

gamma=8, beta= sqrt(1-1/64)=sqrt(63/64)= ~0.9921567.

So,

L=8 *0.9921567 *3e8 *8e-16.

Compute 8 *0.9921567=7.9372536.

3e8 *8e-16=2.4e-7 m.

7.9372536 *2.4e-7=1.90494e-6 m.

So, L=1.90494e-6 m.

Then R=0.35667 * L=0.35667 *1.90494e-6= approx 6.79e-7 m.

But option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is larger than L.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the velocity as a fraction of c, beta= v/c, and then the mean path length is L= beta gamma c tau0.

Wait, but that's what I did.

I'm really stuck here. I think perhaps the correct approach is to go with the calculation, even though the options don't match. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is option A)2.08e-6 m.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, let me recompute gamma.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

So gamma=27/3.41=7.91785714.

Yes.

Wait, perhaps the calculation was done using beta= v/c, and then the mean path length is L=gamma * beta c tau0.

But I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula R= c tau0 * (gamma)(beta).

Which gives the same result.

Hmm.

In conclusion, despite multiple calculations, the correct answer based on the formula is R≈6.72e-7 m, which isn't among the options. However, the closest option provided is A)2.08e-6 m. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options or in my approach. Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is option A.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the relevant quantities.

### Key Information and Formulae:
1. **Proper Lifetime**: The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \).
2. **Relativistic Effects**: The observed lifetime in the lab frame is extended due to time dilation:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} \).
3. **Mean Decay Length**: The mean distance traveled by the particle before decaying is:
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0
   \]
   where \( \beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \).
4. **Probability of Detection**: The probability of observing the decay is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-R/L}
   \]
   To observe at least 30% of the decays, we set \( P \geq 0.3 \). Solving for \( R \), the minimum resolution:
   \[
   R \geq L \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right)
   \]

### Calculations:
1. **Lorentz Factor (\( \gamma \))**:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m c^2} = \frac{27 \, \text{GeV}}{3.41 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Velocity Factor (\( \beta \))**:
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{7.917^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.98405} \approx 0.992
   \]

3. **Mean Decay Length (\( L \))**:
   \[
   L = \gamma \beta c \tau_0 = 7.917 \cdot 0.992 \cdot (3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s})
   \]
   - Compute \( c \tau_0 = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (8 \times 10^{-16}) = 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).
   - Multiply by \( \gamma \beta \): \( 7.917 \cdot 0.992 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-7} \approx 1.8876 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \).
   - Thus, \( L \approx 1.8876 \, \mu\text{m} \).

4. **Minimum Resolution (\( R \))**:
   Using \( P = 0.3 \), we calculate:
   \[
   R \geq L \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - P}\right) = 1.8876 \times 10^{-6} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{0.7}\right)
   \]
   - \( \ln(1/0.7) \approx 0.35667 \).
   - \( R \approx 1.8876 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 0.35667 \approx 6.72 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \) or \( 0.672 \, \mu\text{m} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \))**: This is approximately \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \), which is larger than the calculated \( R \approx 0.672 \, \mu\text{m} \). It is the closest option to the required resolution.
- **Option B (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \))**: This is \( 2.08 \, \text{nm} \), far too small to resolve the decay.
- **Option C (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{m} \))**: This is \( 20.8 \, \text{cm} \), unrealistically large for this context.
- **Option D (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \))**: This is \( 2.08 \, \text{mm} \), also far too large.

### Conclusion:
The calculated minimum resolution \( R \approx 0.672 \, \mu\text{m} \) does not match any of the options exactly. However, the closest option is **A (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \))**, which is approximately three times larger than the calculated value. Given the provided options, **A** is the most reasonable choice.

Answer: A
