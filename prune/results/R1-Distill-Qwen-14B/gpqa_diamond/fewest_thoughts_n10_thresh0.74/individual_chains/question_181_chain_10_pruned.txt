Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if a certain part of the fusion process stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos, I guess) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So, if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos from that process wouldn't reach us anymore, but the change would only be noticeable now on Earth.

So, the question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). They're asking for the ratio flux1/flux2.

Wait, I remember that the Sun's main source of neutrinos comes from the proton-proton chain. The pp chain has a few branches, but I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the pp-I branch is the dominant one, producing two positrons and two neutrinos. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which are less significant but still contribute.

PP-III, I think, involves triple-alpha reactions or maybe higher energy processes. Wait no, triple-alpha is more about helium fusion into carbon in the CNO cycle? Or wait, no, that's not right. The proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun and other low-mass
