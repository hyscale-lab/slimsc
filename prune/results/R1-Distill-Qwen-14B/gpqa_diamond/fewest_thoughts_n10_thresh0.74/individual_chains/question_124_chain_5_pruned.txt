Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds and their detection in a spherical detector. Hmm, I remember that the Lorentz factor is involved here, which is gamma (γ). 

The problem says that when particles are collided, they produce new particles that travel at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. Now, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? 

Wait, I think I need to find how the Lorentz factor affects the probability of the particles reaching the detector. Since it's mentioned that one third reach the walls at gamma=20, maybe the higher the gamma, the more particles reach the walls. Because at higher speeds, they might travel further before decaying.

So, I think the key here is the proper lifetime of the particles and how it dilates due to relativity. The lifetime at rest would be tau (τ), and the dilated lifetime would be gamma times tau (γτ). The particles that reach the detector must have their lifetime long enough to travel the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. 

But wait, the particles are moving at a speed close to the speed of light, so the distance they can travel before decaying depends on their lifetime. The ones that reach the detector's inner walls must have a lifetime such that, in the lab frame, they can cover 30 meters before decaying. 

So, the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is c multiplied by gamma tau, where c is the speed of light. So, distance = c * gamma * tau. But the particle must have enough time to reach the detector, which is 30 meters. So, 30 = c * gamma * tau. 

At gamma=20, one third (1/3) of the particles reach the walls. So, maybe the probability is related to the ratio of their lifetime to the time they need to reach. Hmm, perhaps the fraction that reach is proportional to gamma? Or wait, maybe it's about the speed. Or perhaps it's about the mean lifetime and the
