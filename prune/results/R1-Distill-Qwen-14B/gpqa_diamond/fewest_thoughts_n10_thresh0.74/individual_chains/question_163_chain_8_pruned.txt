Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a solution using a strong acid. They give me the mass of Fe(OH)3 and the volume of the solution, and I need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid required, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with a strong acid, it's usually a neutralization reaction. The hydroxide would react with the H+ ions from the acid to form water. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. So it should react with a strong acid like HCl or H2SO4, but since the acid is monobasic, it's probably something like HCl, which provides one H+ per molecule.

The problem gives me 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how many moles that is. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be Fe (55.85 g/mol) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)). So Fe:55.85, O:3*16=48, H:3*1=3. Total is 55.85 + 48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass. That would be 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Wait, 0.1/106.85 is roughly 0.000936 mol.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid like HCl, the reaction should proceed as:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The HCl solution is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (1000 cm³). So to find the volume needed, I can use moles = Molarity × Volume. Rearranged, Volume = moles / Molarity.

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/dm³. Wait, units are in cm³, so 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³. So 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. But wait, the question says "minimum volume", so maybe I should double-check.

Wait, but wait, is there any other consideration? Because sometimes when dealing with pH, you might have to consider excess H+ ions. But in this case, since we're calculating the minimum volume, the reaction should go just to the equivalence point where all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. So 28.08 cm³ would be the volume. Let me check the options: option C is 28.05, which is very close. So maybe that's the correct volume part.

Now, the pH part. After adding the strong acid, the solution will contain FeCl3, which is a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. So the solution will be acidic. The pH will depend on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions in water.

First, let's find the concentration of Fe^3+ in solution. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 dm³). The moles of Fe^3+ are the same as Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mol. So concentration is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 dm³ = 0.00936 M.

The Fe^3+ ion is a Lewis acid and will hydrolyze in water:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ can be found using Kw / Kb. Wait, but I don't remember
