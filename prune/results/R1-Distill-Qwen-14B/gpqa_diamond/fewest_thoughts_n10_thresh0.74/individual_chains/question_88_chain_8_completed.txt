Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice science question about rotavirus and the immune response. Let's break down what the question is saying and think through each step.

First, the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. So, the GFP is a fluorescent marker to track these proteins. Then, they observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is strong, so I guess the proteins might have been broken down there. But some made it past the stomach, maybe into the small intestine where the rotavirus would typically infect.

Next, these GFP-tagged proteins reached the intestinal mucus. Intestinal mucus has various components and immune cells. The question says some were entangled there before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs are places like the Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines and are part of the immune system's tissues.

They identified the fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cell population. Peyer's patches are sites where immune cells, like B cells, congregate. So, if GFP is present there, perhaps the B cells are taking up the rotavirus proteins and responding to them.

Then, they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes of these cells and found high variability. High variability in the variable regions of heavy chains suggests that some process has altered the genes, leading to different sequences.

Now, the question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me think about each process.

VDJ recombination (option D) is the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments are combined to form the heavy chain of the B cell receptor. This happens in developing B cells, like in the bone marrow, and is part of generating the initial diversity of B cells. But once the B cells are mature, this process stops, right? So if the cells have already undergone VDJ recombination, that's part of their maturation, not something that's happening after they encounter an antigen.

Somatic hypermutation (option A) is a process that occurs in mature B cells after they have been activated by an antigen. It's a mechanism that increases the diversity of the B cell receptors by introducing point mutations in the variable regions. This happens in germinal centers, which are part of secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. So when B cells are proliferating and differentiating in the germinal centers, they undergo somatic hypermutation to tweak their receptors and improve antigen binding.

Class switching recombination (option C) is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG, etc.), which happens after the initial immune response. This process involves recombination of the heavy chain's constant region, which is a different part of the gene than the variable regions. So this affects the class of antibody but not the variability in the sequences of the variable regions.

Complement activation (option B) is part of the innate immune response. It's about the complement system proteins binding to the antigen-antibody complexes and leading to things like opsonization or creating holes in the pathogen's membrane. But this doesn't directly involve the alteration of the B cell receptors' variable regions.

Putting it all together: The GFP-tagged rotavirus proteins are taken up by B cells in the Peyer's patches. These B cells then start proliferating, which happens in germinal centers. In germinal centers, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, which increases the diversity of their antibodies. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes they observed supports this because each B cell might have a slightly different receptor after hypermutation, leading to a diverse population.

So the process would be somatic hypermutation. Looking at the options, that's option A.


The question involves tracking GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus in mice and observing their interaction with the immune system. After oral delivery, some proteins are destroyed by stomach acid, while others reach the intestinal mucus and eventually the secondary lymphoid organs, specifically the Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, consider the options:

1. **VDJ Recombination (Option D):** This process occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J gene segments are rearranged to form the heavy chain of the B cell receptor. However, this process is not active in mature B cells after they leave the bone marrow, so it is unlikely to explain the observed variability.

2. **Somatic Hypermutation (Option A):** This process occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs, where mature B cells undergo point mutations in the variable regions of their B cell receptors. This mechanism increases receptor diversity and improves antigen binding, aligning with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

3. **Class Switching Recombination (Option C):** This process changes the class of antibody produced by B cells (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and involves recombination at the constant region of the heavy chain. However, it does not affect the variability of the variable regions, making it an unlikely explanation.

4. **Complement Activation (Option B):** This is part of the innate immune response and involves complement proteins binding to antigen-antibody complexes. It does not directly alter the variable regions of B cell receptors, so it is not relevant to the observed variability.

The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in germinal centers during the immune response. This process accounts for the diversification of B cell receptors in response to the rotavirus antigens.

Answer: A
