Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is hitting it along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. The options are given, and the angles are small enough that tan(theta) ≈ theta can be used. 

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of maxima and minima. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles. But wait, this isn't a single slit; it's an N-sided polygon with all apothems equal. Oh, right, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. If N is very large, the polygon would approximate a circle because as the number of sides increases, the polygon becomes more like a circle.

Wait, but in the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is different. The single-slit formula doesn't apply. For a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at a certain angle determined by the radius. But wait, the problem says N is infinitely large, so it's a circular aperture. So the question is about a circular aperture's diffraction minima.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Because for a single slit, the diffraction minima are given by a sin(theta) = m λ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. But for a circular aperture (like a pinhole), the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk, and the minima are given by a different formula. The first minimum in the Airy pattern is at theta = 1.22 λ / (diameter). Oh wait, but I need to think about the diameter in terms of the apothem. 

Wait, the apothem a of a regular polygon is related to the radius. For a regular polygon, the apothem a is equal to the radius R when N approaches infinity because as N increases, the apothem approaches the radius of the circumscribed circle. Or wait, no, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. And when N approaches infinity, the inscribed and circumscribed circles both approach the same as the polygon becomes a circle. So the apothem a would be equal to the radius R of the circle. 

So
