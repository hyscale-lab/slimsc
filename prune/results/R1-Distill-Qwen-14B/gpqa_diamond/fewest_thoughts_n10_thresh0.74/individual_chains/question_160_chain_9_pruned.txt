Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. Hmm, all the apothems are the same length 'a'. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh wait, and the light is monochromatic with wavelength λ, coming along the z-axis. The setup is for the far field region, so probably using the Fraunhofer diffraction approximation.

I remember that when dealing with diffraction, the pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the minima occur at specific angles based on the wavelength and the aperture's radius. But this is a polygon with a very large number of sides, N approaching infinity, so it's almost like a circle. Wait, but maybe it's treated as a different kind of shape, like a slit or something else.

Wait, the problem says all apothems are the same. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the side length and the number of sides. But since N is very large, the polygon looks like a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a' perhaps? Or is the apothem different from the radius? No, wait: for a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius (R) is the distance from the center to a vertex. As N approaches infinity, the regular polygon becomes a circle where the apothem 'a' approaches R because the vertices and midpoints of sides become the same.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For a circle, the radius is the same as the apothem because every point on the perimeter is equidistant from the center. So in this case, with N->inf, the aperture is a circle of radius 'a'. So the diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture.

But wait, the options don't have the same value as the single-slit case. Wait, no. For a single slit, the minima are at sinθ = λ/(a), but that's when a is the slit width. For a circular aperture, the first minima are at a sinθ = λ, which is the same as the single-slit, but wait no, the single-slit is a rectangular aperture. For a circular aperture, the first
