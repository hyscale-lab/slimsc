Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about an annihilation process: a proton and an antiproton annihilate to produce two particles of type A plus and two of type A minus. The setup says that the antiproton is moving slowly, which probably implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of particle A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, wait. Let's think about what's happening here. In particle physics, when particles annihilate, they typically convert their mass into energy, which then produces other particles. So in this case, the proton and antiproton annihilate into two A+ and two A- particles.

I remember that in such annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can make some approximations. Also, the problem probably assumes that the initial kinetic energy is negligible compared to the rest mass energy, so the antiproton is non-relativistic.

Wait, wait. Let's get the initial setup clear. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. The proton is probably at rest because the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton.

But wait, no, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving with some velocity, but not too fast. Alternatively, maybe the center of mass frame is considered, but I'm not sure yet.

The rest mass of A is given as 300 MeV, but wait, in the equation, each A+ and A- have that mass, right? So each of the four particles (2 A+ and 2 A-) has a mass of 300 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy of the products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. But wait, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and the antiproton is the same, so the total rest mass is 938 * 2 = 1876 MeV.

Wait, but wait a minute. The
