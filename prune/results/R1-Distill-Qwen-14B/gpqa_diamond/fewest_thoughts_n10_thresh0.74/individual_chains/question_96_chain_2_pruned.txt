Okay, so I have this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy for a black hole is related to its area, specifically the event horizon. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's h-bar, gravitational constant G, Boltzmann's constant k_B, and speed of light c.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should write down the formula correctly. Oh right, the formula is S = (A)/(4 l_p^2) * k_B, where l_p is the Planck length. Because I remember that the area A is in terms of the event horizon radius. Alternatively, sometimes I see it written as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G). Yeah, same thing because l_p squared is (ħ G / c^3), so when you divide by l_p squared, it's the same as multiplying by c^3/(ħ G), I think.

So first, I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius, R_s = 2 G M / c². But wait, maybe I can find the radius from the angular size. The question gives the angular size θ as 10^-17 degrees. 

Angular size θ is related to the actual size (diameter or radius) and the distance to the object. The formula is θ (in radians) ≈ size / distance. But since θ is given in degrees, I need to convert that to radians first. So, 10^-17 degrees is how many radians? Well, 1 degree is π/180 radians, so θ (rad) ≈ 10^-17 * (π/180) ≈ π * 1e-17 / 1.8e2 ≈ around 1.745e-19 radians.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 10^-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = (π / 180) * 1e-17 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

So θ ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, parsec is a unit of distance. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 3.086e16 m * 1e10 = 3.086e26 meters.

The angular size θ is approximately equal to the size of the object divided by the distance. Since the event horizon is a sphere, the size here is the diameter of the event horizon. Wait, the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2 G M / c², so the diameter would be 2 R_s = 4 G M / c². But wait, no. The radius is R_s, so the diameter is 2 R_s = (4 G M)/(c²). So the size s is 2 R_s, which is 4 G M / c².

Wait, no, wait. The angular size θ is the apparent angle, which is approximately equal to the diameter (2 R_s) divided by the distance. So,

θ ≈ (2 R_s) / d

So solving for R_s:

R_s = (θ * d) / 2

So R_s = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2

Let me compute that.

Multiply 1.745e-19 by 3.086e26:

1.745e-19 *3.086e26 = 1.745 *3.086 ≈ 5.37e7 (since 1e-19 *1e26 = 1e7)

So 5.37e7 / 2 ≈ 2.685e7 meters.

So R_s ≈ 2.685e7 meters.

Wait, but the Schwarzschild radius is R_s = 2 G M / c². So from R_s, I can solve for M.

M = (R_s c^2 )/(2 G )

So M = (2.685e7 m * (3e8 m/s)^2 ) / (2 * 6.674e-11 m^3 kg^-1 s^-2 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 2.685e7 m * (9e16 m²/s²) = 2.685e7 *9e16 = 2.4165e24 m
