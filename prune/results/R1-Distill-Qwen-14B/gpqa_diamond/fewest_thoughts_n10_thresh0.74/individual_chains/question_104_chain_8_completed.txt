Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both Neptune-like mass. The planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected them. For planet #1, the spectral line shift was up to 5 milliangstroms. For planet #2, it was 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period compared to planet #1's? The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. The shift relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period somehow.

I think the formula involved here is the Doppler shift related to the velocity of the star. The velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by some formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Oh right, the formula is K = (v) = (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(2π)) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) ... Wait, maybe I should recall the simplified version when M_p is much smaller than M_star, which it is in this case because Neptune is much less massive than the Sun.

So the simplified formula would be K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (2π) * (1 + (M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) ) ) Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula for velocity semi-amplitude is K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ 1/( (2π) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(-1) No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the formula is K = ( (27 * π) / (2 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ... Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the key factors. Since both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass, the main variables here are the velocity shifts and the orbital periods.

Wait, the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by this formula: K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since the orbital period T is in the denominator, and assuming that the eccentricity e is similar for both planets (they're circular, so e=0, so that term is 1), and since planet masses are similar and M_p << M_star, I can approximate this as K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )

So, because M_p is the same, and M_star is same (since both stars have same mass as Sun), then K is inversely proportional to T^(1/3). Or, K ∝ 1/T^(1/3). Alternatively, T ∝ 1/K^3. Wait, because if K increases, T decreases. Because K is the velocity amplitude. So, if K is larger, that would imply a shorter period because the star is moving faster, which implies the planet is orbiting more closely, thus shorter period.

Wait, but wait. Let's get the exact relation right. Let me rearrange the formula for T.

From K = ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) )

Let me cube both sides:

K^3 = [ (2π G) / (c T) ) ] * [ M_p^3 ) / M_star^2 ]

Rearranging for T:

T = (2π G) / (c) * (M_p^3 ) / (K^3 M_star^2 )

But wait, since M_p and M_star are constants (same for both planets), T is proportional to 1/K^3 multiplied by other constants. So T ∝ 1/K^3.

So, T2 / T1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Because T is inversely proportional to K cubed.

So, if K2 is larger than K1, then T2 is smaller than T1? Wait, no. Because if K increases, T decreases. Because higher K means faster orbital movement, shorter period. So, K2 is 7 milliangstrom, K1 is 5. So K2 > K1, so T2 would be less than T1. But wait, the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So (T2)/(T1) = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. K1 is 5, K2 is 7. So T2 = T1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because the formula is T ∝ 1/K^3. So T2 / T1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Yes, because T2 = (1/K2^3) * [something], T1 = (1/K1^3) * [same something], so T2/T1 = (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, with K1 =5, K2=7,

T2/T1 = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So T2 is approximately 0.364 times T1. That would mean that planet #2's period is about 0.364 times that of planet #1's, so planet #2's period is shorter. But the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. So if T2 is 0.364 * T1, then it's shorter. So the ratio T2/T1 is 0.364, which is about 0.36 times.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait but wait a second. I thought that a higher K would mean a shorter period. So planet #2 has a higher K (7 >5), so T2 is shorter than T1. So the question is how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's. That would be T2 / T1 = 0.364, which is shorter. So the answer is approximately 0.36, so option A.

But let me think again. Because sometimes the relationship might be different. Another way to think: higher K implies the star is moving more, which suggests a more massive planet or a closer-in orbit. Since the planet masses are same, a higher K implies a shorter period (closer orbit). So yes, higher K means shorter period. So planet #2 has higher K, so shorter period. So the ratio T2/T1 is 0.364, so the period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1. Therefore, it's shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? So it's about 0.36 times as long, so about 0.36 times, which is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which corresponds to the periodic shift of the spectral line, is related to the orbital period \( T \) of the planet. The relationship between \( K \) and \( T \) is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{T^{1/3}}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the orbital periods of two planets is inversely proportional to the cube of the ratio of their velocity semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

For Planet #1, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and for Planet #2, \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means that the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times the orbital period of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's period is about 0.36 times as long as Planet #1's period.

From the given options, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**
