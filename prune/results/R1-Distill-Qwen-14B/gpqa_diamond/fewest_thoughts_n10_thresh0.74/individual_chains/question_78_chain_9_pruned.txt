Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in an electromagnetic field. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). We need to find the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given that t is greater than tr, which is the time when the field was generated. The setup also mentions a vector d, which is the displacement from where the field was generated to the observation point r.

Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields through Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field. The potentials are usually expressed in terms of the charge and current distributions.

Wait, the scalar potential V for a static charge would be something like q/(4πε₀ r), right? But this charge is moving, so there's a time delay involved. Oh, right, the retarded time concept. The fields at a later time depend on the position and velocity of the charge at an earlier time.

So the vector d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. So, the distance would be |d|, but I think the denominator might involve some combination of d and v, because the charge is moving. 

I remember that for the scalar potential, when the charge is moving, it's not just q/(4πε₀ r), but there's a term involving the velocity. Or wait, maybe the scalar potential still looks similar, but the vector potential has a term involving the charge's velocity.

Wait, no, the scalar potential for a moving charge might still be similar to the static case, but with a modification. Because the charge's velocity affects the potentials through the motion. Let me think about the Liénard potentials. Oh right, the potentials for a moving charge are given by the Liénard expressions.

Liéniard's formulas for the scalar and vector potentials. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) divided by [r - (v t)/c²], but wait, I'm not sure about the exact form. Or is it (r - (v t_r)/(c²)) where t_r is the retarded time?

Alternatively, the scalar
