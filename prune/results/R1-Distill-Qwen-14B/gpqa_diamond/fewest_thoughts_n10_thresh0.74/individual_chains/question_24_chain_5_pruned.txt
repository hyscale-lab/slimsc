Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow since I'm just starting to get into these kinds of problems.

The problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds, like alkenes or possibly some conjugated dienes. Because alkenes can undergo addition reactions with bromine, causing the solution to decolorize.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction and forms another equimolar mixture Y. This mixture Y has two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Hmm, if Y doesn't react with bromine, maybe the double bonds are gone or changed in some way. Oh wait, the question says it's a result of a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps one of the components is undergoing that.

Next, the hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%. That's interesting. Let me calculate what that means. The mass fraction of hydrogen is about 14.28%, which is roughly 1/7. Because 14.28% is approximately 1/7 (since 1/7 is about 14.29%). So the molecular formula would have a ratio of H to the rest that gives that.

Wait, for a hydrocarbon, the formula is CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) * 100% = 14.28%. Let's set that up.

Let me compute: (m)/(12n + m) ) = 0.1428. Let's see, 0.1428 is approximately 1/7, so 1/7 = m/(12n + m). Cross-multiplying, 12n + m = 7m → 12n = 6m → 2n = m. So m = 2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n. That
