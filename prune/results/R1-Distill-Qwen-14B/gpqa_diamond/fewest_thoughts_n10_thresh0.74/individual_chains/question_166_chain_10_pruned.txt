Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

Alright, the Lagrangian is given. Let me parse it. So, it has terms for right-handed neutrinos NR, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar phi. The terms include kinetic terms for NR and phi, gauge kinetic terms for S, some interaction terms with y_i coupling phi to NR, and then a potential V involving phi, S, H. Wait, wait, but what about H? The question mentions H2, the pseudo-Goldstone boson. Oh, right, in the potential, H is another scalar field, maybe an SU(2) doublet like the Higgs?

The fields: N_iR are singlets, so they don't carry any gauge charge. S is a scalar doublet, so it's in the (1,2,1) representation, probably like the Higgs field. Phi is a singlet scalar (1,1,0).

The vevs are given: <phi> squared is x² + v², where <phi> is x and <h> is v. Wait, wait, is h another field? Oh, maybe h is part of H? Because in the potential V(phi, S, H), H might be another scalar, perhaps the Higgs doublet with vev v. So, phi has a vev x, and H (maybe the Higgs) has vev v. Or perhaps phi's vev is x, and h is part of H, which has vev v. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but maybe I can proceed.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons come from spontaneous symmetry breaking when a global symmetry is broken, leading to massless bosons unless some other effects give them mass. But in the Standard Model, the Higgs is a result of the breaking of the electroweak symmetry, which is a local symmetry, so the Higgs doesn't become a Goldstone boson because the symmetry is gauged.

Wait, but in this case, if there are multiple scalar fields, maybe there's an approximate Goldstone boson. The pseudo-Goldstone would have a mass that's small compared to the symmetry breaking scale. But the question mentions radiative corrections, so we're looking at quantum loop effects that can generate a mass for H2.

So, the mass squared of H2 would get contributions from various particles in loops. The general formula for the mass of a scalar from loops is something like (loop factor) times (sum over particles) (couplings squared times their masses squared) divided by (the symmetry breaking vev squared). 

Looking at the options, each is a sum of terms each multiplied by alpha coefficients (which are loop factors, probably factors of 1/(16 pi^2) each, but the overall factor is 1/(8 pi^2
