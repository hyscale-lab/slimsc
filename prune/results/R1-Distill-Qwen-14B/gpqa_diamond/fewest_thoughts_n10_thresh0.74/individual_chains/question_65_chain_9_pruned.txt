Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question involves two different reactions, and I have to figure out the major products A and B based on the given options. 

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. The second reaction is (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base, LDA. The options give different possibilities for A and B, so I need to work through each reaction step by step.

Starting with the first reaction. The compound is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure here is a spiro with rings of 3 and 5 members. The 1-vinyl group is attached, so that's a double bond connected to the spiro center.

The reagents are THF, which is a solvent, KH (potassium hydride), and then H+ workup. Wait, what's the role of each reagent here. KH is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. But when used in certain conditions, maybe it's for elimination or some kind of ring-opening or forming.

Looking at the structure: the spiro alcohol has the -OH group on the same carbon as the vinyl group. So, when treated with a strong base like KH, it might deprotonate the alcohol. But since it's an enol, perhaps it's more about enolate formation? Or maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Wait, wait. The starting material is a spiro alcohol with a double bond. When you treat an alcohol with a strong base like KH, you can get an elimination reactionâ€”forming an alkene. But wait, it's already an enol. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to a ring expansion or some kind of cyclopropane formation? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in certain conditions, especially with spiro compounds, the base can abstract a proton leading to a ring-opening, or perhaps a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement? Or maybe the spiro structure will undergo some kind of electrocyclic ring opening
