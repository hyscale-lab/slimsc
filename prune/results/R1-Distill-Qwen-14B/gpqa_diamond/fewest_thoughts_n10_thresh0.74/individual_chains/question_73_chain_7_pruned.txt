Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we need to use special relativity concepts, not classical mechanics.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I'm a bit confused about how to find the relative speed between them. Wait, I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from relativity. Oh right! Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up like in classical mechanics; you have to account for the speed of light being a limit.

The formula for adding velocities is (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)). So, the relative speed isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. No, that would be the case in classical physics, but here we have to consider the relativistic effect. Let me think: when one object is moving at velocity u and another at v in the same direction, the relative speed from the perspective of one to the other is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), where u is the velocity of the object and v is the velocity of the reference frame. So in this case,
