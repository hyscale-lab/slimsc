Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. Since it's oscillating, it must be radiating electromagnetic waves. The wavelength is λ, and in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is some function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also the form of f.

Wait, right, in radiation problems, especially involving dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle. For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a function of cosθ squared or something like that. Oh wait, the radiation pattern for an electric dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So maximum radiation is at θ=90 degrees, but wait, wait—no, I think I'm mixing up electric and magnetic dipoles. Wait, no, for an electric dipole, the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So maximum at θ=90 degrees.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether it's an electric or magnetic dipole. Hmm, but maybe for any dipole, the radiation pattern is symmetric in that way. But wait, the problem says it's spheroidal, so perhaps it's a dipole-like radiation.

Wait, so the power radiated per unit solid angle is f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A. So the maximum occurs when θ is such that f is maximum. For a dipole, maximum at θ=90, but if the symmetry is along z, perhaps the maximum is at 90 degrees, but wait, in the problem, the question is about θ=30 degrees, so the fraction would be the value of f at θ=30 divided by the maximum f.

But wait, wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f is a function that varies with θ. So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that is radiated at a particular θ. Or wait, no. The maximum power is A, which is the maximum value of f multiplied by something? Or perhaps A is the total power radiated.

Wait, the question says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle. Wait, no, wait. No, because the power per unit solid angle is f. So the maximum value of f is A. So when you integrate f over all solid angles, you get the total power.

Wait, wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The power radiated per unit solid angle is f. So the total power would be the integral of f dΩ. So the maximum value of f is A. So for each direction θ, the power per solid angle is f, and the maximum value of f is A.

So when θ is 30 degrees, the value of f is f(λ, 30). The question is asking for the fraction of A that this represents. Or wait, no—the question states "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ = 30 degrees." Oh, wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the power at θ=30 to A. So if f is the power per solid angle, and the maximum is A, then the fraction is f(30) / A.

Wait, but in reality, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is given by f proportional to sin²θ, and the maximum is at θ=90 degrees.
