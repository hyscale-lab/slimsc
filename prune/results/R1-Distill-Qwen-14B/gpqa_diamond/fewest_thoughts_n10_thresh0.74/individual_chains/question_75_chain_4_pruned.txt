Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using Chinese hamster ovary cells to transfect a plasmid. The problem is that they can't overexpress the protein as expected. They provided the plus strand DNA sequence of their construct and are asking what's wrong.

So the options are A to D. Let's go through each.

First, the person modified the GADD45G gene by adding a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. HA tags are usually added for detection purposes, like in immunoblotting. So the construct should express a GADD45G protein with an HA tag at the beginning.

They transfected the plasmid into CHO cells, which are commonly used for protein expression. They selected for antibiotic resistance, which suggests they have a selection marker (like neomycin) in their construct. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

Looking at the DNA sequence. Let me think about how the sequence might cause problems. Since the construct isn't working, there's probably an issue in the coding sequence.

Option A: The HA determinant has a missense mutation. HA is a short peptide, maybe 10 amino acids. If the DNA for HA has a mutation, the protein might not form the correct epitope. But if the HA is at the N-terminus, a mutation could prevent detection, but the question is about overexpression. Maybe the HA isn't functional, but would that prevent expression? Or perhaps the HA is part of a signal peptide or affects the reading frame. Wait, no, because the HA is added as a tag, it's supposed to be in frame. If the HA sequence has a mutation, maybe it doesn't produce a functional epitope, but the protein should still be expressed. However, the issue here is lack of overexpression, so maybe the HA isn't expressed, but that might not prevent the rest of the protein from being made. Not sure yet.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. That would mean a premature stop codon. So looking for a stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the sequence. Let's scan the DNA. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. The plus strand is the coding strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this. So looking for in-frame TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Wait, let me go through the DNA sequence. The sequence is a long stretch, so let's look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA. Since the plus strand is given, the mRNA would be the same except T becomes U. So the mRNA would have UAA, UAG, or UGA as stop codons.

Looking through the given DNA sequence:

Looking for triplet sequences that translate to stop codons.

Let's go through the DNA:

Looking for TGA in DNA, which is TGA in mRNA (stop). Or TAG (which would be ATG in DNA, but that's the start codon). Or TAA (which would be UAA in mRNA). Let me scan.

Wait, the end of the sequence is ...CTGAGTGA. Let's see: the last part is ...GAGTGA.

Breaking it down: GAG is the codon for Glu,
