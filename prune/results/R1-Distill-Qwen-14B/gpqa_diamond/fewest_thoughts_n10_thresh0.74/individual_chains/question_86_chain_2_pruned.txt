Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions with two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, depending on which reagent was used.

Wait, no, actually, let me re-read the question. Oh, right, Reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+ to give the (R) product, and Reaction B uses BH3 and H+ to give the (S) product. Wait no, no, the problem statement is Reaction A is A + LiBH4 + H+ --> (R)-4-ethyl... and Reaction B is B + BH3 + H+ --> (S)-4-ethyl... So the reagents are different for each.

I need to find the starting materials A and B from the options given.

The options are all structures of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different configurations (R or S), either both A and B being same or different.

Hmm. I think this has to do with the reduction of ketones or maybe esters or something else. Wait, wait, the product is a tetrahydropyranone (a cyclic ketone). Oh, wait, tetra
