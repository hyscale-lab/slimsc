Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let's see. The molecular formula can give me some clues about the structure. Let me figure out the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That means probably one ring, maybe a double bond, and some other rings or double bonds.

The NMR data is given: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me try to interpret this. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet (t) and 1H. A triplet at around 9-10 ppm makes me think of an aldehyde proton because aldehyde protons typically show up around 9-10. Oh wait, but depending on substituents and environment, maybe it's not. But aldehyde is a possibility. Alternatively, an acidic proton like phenol, but that's usually broader and maybe lower ppm. Or maybe an amide? Hmm.

Wait, the triplet for 1H. Aldehydes usually are singlet because there's no neighboring H. So maybe that's not it. Another possibility is an enol proton, but those are usually around 6-8 ppm. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde but coupled with something. Wait, maybe it's a vinyl proton adjacent to an aldehyde? I'm a bit confused there.

Looking at the other signals. The 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is a doublet, so maybe two adjacent protons in an aromatic ring
