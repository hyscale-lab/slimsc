Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm kind of new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis. They looked at the target gene in mutants and found changes in the first exon.

The question is asking which mutation would probably eliminate the compound. The options are mutants 1-4, and the choices are A to D.

Let me break down what each part means. The anti-nutritional compound is made by this gene, so we need to disrupt the gene's function. If the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made, right? So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. So the first few nucleotides are ATGTTTCTC...

Now, looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing to the wild type, let's see. The first part is ATGTTTCTC... but in mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTAC. Wait, let me look at the exact change.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compare each nucleotide. Alternatively, maybe considering what kind of mutation each is.

Looking at the changes:

Mutant 1: The beginning is ATGTTCTACG... compared to ATGTTTCTC... So the original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGG..., and the mutant is ATGTTCTACGCTGG... Hmm. So the fourth nucleotide is different. Let's count:

Original: positions 1-10: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTACGCT GGT... Wait, perhaps the sequence is a bit longer. Wait, maybe I should write them out.

Wait, maybe another approach: each mutation is a point mutation. Because EMS typically causes point mutations, usually by alkylation leading to base changes.

So each of these mutants has a change in the first exon. So which change would most likely disrupt the gene function?

Looking for nonsense mutations, missense, or frameshifts.

Wait, but in the options, all the mutations are point changes, as the sequences are same length. So no frameshifts; each is a substitution.

So perhaps a nonsense mutation (stop codon) would be best, but I don't see any TGA or TAG or AGA/... in the given sequences. Wait, looking at the end of the sequences, the wild type ends with ...TGA-3'. So the last three are TGA, which is a stop codon.

Wait, but that's the same in all. So perhaps the question is about an in-frame change that creates a premature stop codon elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe a missense mutation that disrupts the enzyme's active site.

Alternatively, a splice site mutation, but since these are in the first exon, which is probably at the beginning, perhaps the mutations are in the coding sequence.

Wait, the question says the changes are in the first exon area. Exons are coding regions, so the mutations are in the coding sequence.

So the idea is to find a mutation that disrupts the protein product, so the gene is non-functional, thus the anti-nutritional compound isn't made.

So which mutation leads to a stop codon or a change in the protein that disrupts its function.

Looking at each mutant's sequences:

Mutant 1: the sequence in the first part is ATGTTCTACGCTGG...

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGG...

So the fourth nucleotide is T in wild type, but in mutant 1, position 4 is C.

Wait, maybe better to compare each position. Let's write out the first few nucleotides:

Intact gene: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ...

Mutant 1: 5' ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG...

Wait, perhaps I should index them.

For the initial part:

Original: positions 1-20 (assuming) are:

1-4: ATGT

5-8: TTCT

9-12: CGCT

13-16: GGT A

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where each mutation occurs.

Mutant 1: The change is in the first exon, perhaps leading to a substitution. Let's see, in the first 20 nucleotides:

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTA...

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTA...

So the fourth and fifth positions are T and T in original. In mutant1, the fourth is C? Let me see:

Wait, original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Comparing, the first part of mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGC... So perhaps the original had T at position 4, and mutant1 has C.

Wait, perhaps the fifth nucleotide in the original is T, but in mutant1, it's A.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe let me look for where the changes are. Let's line them up.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG... Wait, I'm probably not doing this right. Alternatively, perhaps looking for the exact point of mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations are in the start codon or cause a frameshift, but I don't think so because all sequences are same length.

Wait, another approach: which mutation creates a premature stop codon? Because that would truncate the protein, possibly making it nonfunctional.

Looking at the mutant sequences in more detail:

The intact gene ends with ...TGA, which is a stop codon. So in the middle, the coding sequence continues.

Looking for any occurrence of TGA, TAG, or AGA in the middle that could be a new stop codon.

But all the sequences have the same ending, so perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon earlier.

Mutant1: the part is ...CGTCG... ends with CG. Hmm, not a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the original has a start codon at the beginning (ATG), which is the same in all.

Let me look for any place in the mutants where a new stop codon appears.

Mutant3's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, looking at the middle:

Original has ACT TCT GTG... So the original sequence has ACT TCT GTG.

Mutant3's sequence: ACT TCA CTG TGC ... Hmm, not sure. Wait, the middle part of mutant3 is TGTCACTTCTGTGG. So where could a stop codon appear?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a premature stop codon. Let's see.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Looking at any triplet that is a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA).

In mutant1, the sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA... So the original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT... The mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT... The part after the mutation is CTA CGC TGG...

Wait, looking at the triplets in the coding sequence:

Original first few triplets: ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CT C (but the fourth nucleotide is T, so triplet 4-6 is T C G (CGT, which is Arg).

In mutant1, the fourth nucleotide is C, so triplet 4-6 is T C A (CTA, which is Leu).

Wait, so no stop codon there.

Mutant1's sequence in the first part: ATG TTT CT A CGC TGG... So the first triplet is ATG (start), next is TTT (Phe), then CTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then TGG (Trp). So no stop yet.

Does any other triplet in mutant1 form a stop?

Looking further, let's see. After the initial area, the next part is ... TCTGTGGATGAAC... So the GAAC is part of the coding. Wait, but in the mutant1, at the end of the sequence, it's TCGC… So the part before the stop is ...TCG C...? Hmm, not seeing a new stop.

Wait, maybe I should look for any occurrence of TGA or TAG in the coding sequence.

In the original, the last three are TGA. In mutants, maybe some have TGA in the middle.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So the sequence is ...ACGCTACTTC...

Wait, let's look for TGA or TAG in the coding. For example, in the middle of the mutant4 sequence, do we have TGA?

Looking at the part: ...ACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT...

So after ACTTC comes TGTGGA, then TGAAC. Wait, TGA is part of TGAAC. So the triplet just before that is GGA (Gly), then TGA (stop). So does that mean that in Mutant4, there's a TGA in the middle?

Wait, let me check the exact sequence.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So the part is ...CTACTTCTGTGGATGAAC...

Breaking into triplets:

CTA CTT CTG TGG ATG AAC...

Wait, no. Let me index it as groups of three:

Positions 1-3: ATG (start)

4-6: TTT (Phe)

7-9: TAC

10-12: GCT (Ala)

13-15: ACT

16-18: TCT (Ser)

19-21: GTG (Val)

22-24: GAT (Asp)

25-27: GAA (Glu)

28-30: CAA (Gln)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the triplets wrong. Let me count from the start:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC...

Wait, perhaps I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 has a TGA in the middle.

Looking again, the mutant4 is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Hmm, the part after the mutation is ACT CTT CTG TGG ATG AAC... So the triplet starting at position, say, 25 is "TGG", which is Trp. Next triplet is "GAT" (Asp), then "GAA" (E), then "AC" (but it's followed by more). Wait, perhaps the key is looking for TGA in the middle.

Looking at mutant4, the sequence is ...TTCTGTGGATGAAC... So the triplet after TCTGT is GGA (positions 19-21?), then TGG (22-24?), then GAT (25-27?), GAA (28-30), etc. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe a better approach is to look for where each mutation occurs.

Mutant1 changes the sixth nucleotide: original is T, mutant1 is A.

Wait, maybe I should number the nucleotides. Let's say the start is position 1.

Original: 1-3: ATG (start)
4: T
5: T
6: T
7: C
8: T
9: C
10: G
11: C
12: T
13: G
14: G
15: T
16: A
17: C
18: T
19: T
20: A
21: T
22: T
23: G
24: T
25: C
26: G
27: T
28: G
29: A
30: C
... and so on.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the specific mutations.

Looking at each mutant compared to the original:

Mutant1: Change is in the sixth nucleotide? Let me compare:

Original first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So the original has TTTCTC, and the mutant has TTCTAC. So the third T (position 5) is followed by CTA instead of TCT.

Wait, perhaps the original is ...TTTCTC..., and the mutant1 is ...TTCTAC...

So, looking at the fifth and sixth nucleotides:

Original: TTTCTC → positions 4-9 are T T C T C G.

Mutant1: TTCTAC → positions 4-9 are T T C T A C.

So the fifth nucleotide is C in mutant1, whereas in original, it's T.

So at position 5: original is T, mutant1 is C.

But wait, position 5 is the third T in the original. So that's the third T of TTT. So perhaps the change is from TTTCTC to TTCTAC.

Wait, perhaps the exact change is at position 6 or 7.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is in the sixth nucleotide. Let me see:

Original: positions 4-9: T T C T C G.

Mutant1: positions 4-9: T T C T A C.

So, position 6: original is C (6th), mutant1 is A.

So the sixth nucleotide is changed from C to A. So the change is at position 6 (counting from the start, 1-based).

So, the original triplet at positions 4-6 is T T C (Ser), and in mutant1, it becomes T T A (Ile).

Wait, that's a substitution from Ser to Ile. Missense mutation but not a stop.

Mutant2: Original: ...TTTCTC... → ...TTCTAA...

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Wait, in the original, it's TTTCTC, and in mutant2, it's TTCTAA.

So positions 4-9 in original: T T C T C G.

Mutant2: T T C T A A.

So position 6 is A instead of C, position 7 is A instead of T.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Line them up:

Original: positions 4-9: T T C T C G.

Mutant2: positions 4-9: T T C T A A.

So, the sixth base is A instead of C, and seventh is A instead of T.

So, the triplet at positions 4-6 in original is T T C (Ser), and in mutant2, it's T T C (still Ser) because 4-6 are T T C.

Then, positions 7-9: original is T C G (Ala), mutant2 is T A A (which is TAA, a stop codon! Oh! So in mutant2, the triplet TAA is introduced.

Wait, yes! Because in the original, positions 7-9 are T C G (Ala), but in mutant2, positions 7-9 are T A A, which is a stop codon (TAA is a stop).

That would cause the protein to terminate early, so the gene product is truncated and likely nonfunctional.

So if the gene product is nonfunctional, the anti-nutritional compound won't be made.

So mutant2 has introduced a premature stop codon, which would likely eliminate the compound.

Similarly, looking at the other mutants:

Mutant3: Original at positions 4-9 is T T C T C G.

Mutant3's sequence is ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, not sure. Let me check: the first part of mutant3 is ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGT...

So the original is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGT...

So perhaps the fourth nucleotide is T in original and remains T, but let's compare:

Original: positions 4-9: T T C T C G.

Mutant3: positions 4-9: T T T A C G.

Wait, so positions 4-9 in mutant3: T T T A C G.

So triplet 4-6 is T T T (Phe), triplet 7-9 is A C G (Ala).

No stop codon here.

Mutant4: Original: positions 4-9: T T C T C G.

Mutant4: positions 4-9: T T T A C T.

Wait, no, looking at the mutant4 sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So the first part is ...TTTTACGCTACT.

So original is ...TTTCTC..., mutant4 is ...TTTACG...

So the change might be at position 7: in original, it's T, in mutant4 it's A.

Wait, so the seventh nucleotide is changed to A, making the triplet TAC (positions 5-7?), which is Tyr.

Alternatively, perhaps the change is in the sixth position.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but from earlier, mutant2 introduces a TAA stop codon, which would be the most likely to disrupt the gene.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur through a premature stop codon (nonsense mutation), which truncates the protein and renders it nonfunctional. The question provides four mutant sequences, and we analyze each for such changes.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - The original sequence in the first exon is `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'`.  
   - Mutant 1 has the sequence `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3'`.  
   - The mutation changes the sixth nucleotide from `C` to `A`, altering the triplet `CTC` (Ser) to `CTA` (Leu). This is a missense mutation but does not introduce a stop codon.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - The original sequence in this region is `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'`.  
   - Mutant 2 has the sequence `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3'`.  
   - The mutation changes the seventh and eighth nucleotides from `TC` to `AA`, altering the triplet `TCT` (Ser) to `TAA`. The sequence `TAA` is a stop codon, introducing a premature termination in the protein. This would likely disrupt the gene's function and prevent the anti-nutritional compound from being synthesized.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - The original sequence in this region is `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'`.  
   - Mutant 3 has the sequence `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'`.  
   - The mutation changes the fourth nucleotide from `T` to `T`, and subsequent changes do not introduce a stop codon. This is a missense mutation but does not disrupt the gene's function.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - The original sequence in this region is `ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'`.  
   - Mutant 4 has the sequence `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3'`.  
   - The mutation changes the seventh nucleotide from `C` to `T`, altering the triplet `CTG` (Leu) to `CTT` (Ser). This is a missense mutation but does not introduce a stop codon.  

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`), which truncates the protein and disrupts the gene's function. This makes it the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
