Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read the question carefully. The question involves a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, the researcher checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots appearing. I need to figure out which of the options A to D are the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, they typically undergo an addition reaction. The structure given has an ether linkage, with the benzene ring connected via an oxygen to a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. So the structure is something like Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but wait, no. Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is attached to the oxygen. Let me draw this mentally.

The structure would be benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2CH2? Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl. So it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no. Wait, butenyl is four carbons. For but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons in total. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me number: 1 2 3 4.

But-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that's beyond the four-carbon chain. Wait, maybe I should think of it as 1,2,3,4 with positions 3 and 4 having the double bond. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl would be:

Carbon 1: attached to oxygen and a CH2 group.

Carbon 2: CH2.

Carbon 3: CH, because the double bond is between
