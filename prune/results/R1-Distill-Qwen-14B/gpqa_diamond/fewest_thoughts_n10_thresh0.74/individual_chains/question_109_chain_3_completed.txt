Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and partial waves. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and the problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find out which partial wave is not permitted.

Wait, okay, let's start from the beginning. The initial state is 1S0. I remember that the term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J). So for 1S0, S is 0 because (2*0+1)=1. L is S, which is 0, so L=0. And J is 0, since it's the total angular momentum. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X. So the process is NN → NN' + X? Or maybe the original NN bound system emits X, so it's more like the NN system changes state after emitting X. Wait, the problem says it's a bound system emitting X. So perhaps it's an emission, so the initial state is the bound NN in 1S0, and it emits X, becoming another state of NN.

Wait, the term is "emit a particle X". So maybe the process is something like NN → NN + X? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's a decay or an emission where the NN system remains, but a particle is emitted. Or maybe it's a two-body decay? Wait, the question says 'the final NN state', so I think the emission is that the NN system (like a nucleus) emits a particle X, so the initial state is the NN bound state, and the final state is perhaps another NN state plus X. But the question is about the allowed partial waves for the process.

But wait, the question is about the partial wave of X, denoted by the lowercase letter. The options are like 1S0 → 7D1 + p, etc. So the emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum state. So the problem is about the allowed angular momentum states (partial waves) for X.

But how do I approach this? Let me think about the given conditions.

The problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, that equation: T = S + L +1 mod 2? So T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused about that—Pauli exclusion principle applies because nucleons are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. The wavefunction includes spin, spatial, and isospin parts. So the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of the two nucleons.

So the isospin part contributes a symmetry factor. For two identical particles, the isospin part of the wavefunction must account for antisymmetry. If the total isospin T is even (like T=0), then the isospin wavefunction is symmetric or antisymmetric depending on specifics. Wait, maybe I should think about the requirement for the wavefunction.

For two identical particles, the total wavefunction is a product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts. Since they're fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. So if the spin part is symmetric, the spatial and isospin parts must be antisymmetric, and vice versa.

Hmm, the problem gives T(NN) = 0. So the isospin state must be symmetric or antisymmetric? I think that for bosons, the isospin part is symmetric, but for fermions, the isospin part could be part of the antisymmetry. Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up here.

Wait, the given equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T is the isospin of the final state NN. Since T=0, which is even or odd? Let me think in terms of mod 2. 0 mod 2 is 0, which is even. So T is even.

So according to the equation, T = S + L +1 mod 2. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. That implies S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L have opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even.

Wait, but wait: for the initial state, which is 1S0. So initial state S=0, L=0, J=0. After emitting X, the final state has T=0. So the final NN state has T=0, S_final, L_final, and J_final.

But the problem is about X, which is emitted. So the partial wave of X is determined by the angular momentum state, which is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. The process would involve angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the decay as:

Initial state: 1S0 (NN)
Emits X: so the process is NN → NN + X.

But wait, the problem says the NN system emits X, so perhaps the initial and final NN states are the same? Or maybe the emission is accompanied by a transition to another NN state. Hmm, maybe I need to consider the conservation of angular momentum and parity for the emitted X.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is more like the NN system (bound) → NN in another state plus X. But the problem says the final NN state has T=0, so the initial state must have T such that after emitting X, the final T is 0.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial isospin T_initial would depend on the system's configuration. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the decay of the NN bound state into another state plus the emitted X. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state consists of another NN state (with T=0) and X. So the process is 1S0 → [NN state with T=0] + X.

In that case, the initial and final states must satisfy conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the final NN state has T=0. So the NN state after emission has T=0. The initial state's T is perhaps different, but I'm not given that.

But maybe I can find the initial T and determine the allowed transitions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the parity of the emitted particle X. Since X has intrinsic parity -1, perhaps the parity of the process (including angular momentum) must be conserved.

Wait, the problem is about the partial waves (angular momentum states) of X. So each option gives a possible state for X, like 7D1, 3S1, etc. The partial wave is denoted by the angular momentum number l. So for each option, X's l is given by the letter: for example, option D is 3P0, so P is l=1.

Wait, the letters correspond to l: S is l=0, P is l=1, D l=2, F l=3, etc.

So for each option, X's l is S=0, S=0, D=2, P=1, etc.

Now, the key point is to use conservation of angular momentum and parity.

So the initial state has certain angular momentum, and the emitted X has l. The final state (the NN state) must have L' such that the total angular momentum is conserved.

But wait, the initial state's J is 0 (since 1S0 has J=0). So the total angular momentum after emission must be such that the sum of the NN's J' and X's l equals 0. Wait, that's not possible unless X's l is 0, but that's not the case in any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. The initial state is a bound state with J_initial = 0. Upon emitting X, the system (NN) goes into a state with J_final, and X has orbital angular momentum l. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_final + l. But J_initial is 0, so J_final = -l. But since J is a vector, the magnitude |J_final - l| ≤ J_initial ≤ J_final + l. Since J_initial is 0, J_final must equal l, but with opposite direction.

Wait, but J_final and l are vectors, not scalars. So J_initial = 0 = J_final + l → J_final = -l. So the magnitude of J_final is l, but direction opposite. So that's possible only if J_final is l. So the total angular momentum of the NN state is l, and X has l.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Since J_initial = 0, the final total angular momentum (J_final + l) must also be 0. So J_final = - l. So the magnitudes must satisfy |J_final - l| ≤ 0 ≤ J_final + l. So that's only possible if J_final = l, but J_initial is 0.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of spherical addition. The initial state has J=0, so the sum of the final J' and X's l must be 0. So J' must be equal and opposite to l. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps parity comes into play. The parity of the initial state is P_initial. The parity of the emitted X is intrinsic parity (-1), and the parity of the final NN state is P_final. The overall parity must be conserved, so:

P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l,

where l is the orbital angular momentum of X.

Wait, because when a particle is emitted with orbital angular momentum l, the parity changes by (-1)^l. So the equation becomes:

P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l.

Hmm, so I need to find the parity of the initial and final NN states and the parity of X.

The initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, so J=0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^(L). So for the initial state, L=0 → parity is 1.

When emitting X, the parity of the final state would be P_final = P_initial * (-1)^l * P_X.

Wait, I think the formula is:

P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l.

Because the overall parity is a product of the intrinsic parity of the final particles and the parity change due to the orbital angular momentum (since orbital angular momentum contributes a (-1)^l factor when exchanged).

But X has intrinsic parity -1. So P_X = -1.

So plugging in, we get:

P_initial = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l.

But the initial parity is 1 (since L=0).

So 1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l.

Hmm, let's rearrange that.

1 = P_final * (-1)^{l+1}.

Which can be written as P_final = (-1)^{l +1}.

But I also need to consider the Pauli statistics condition given in the problem: T = S + L +1 mod 2.

In the final state, T=0.

So T = 0.

So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2.

Which means S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S and L have opposite parity.

Hmm, but what's S and L in the final NN state?

Wait, the final NN state has its own S and L. Let me denote them as S' and L'.

So S' + L' ≡ 1 mod 2.

So S' and L' have opposite parity.

But how does that relate to the problem?

Wait, perhaps the parity of the final NN state is determined by L', so P_final = (-1)^{L'}.

So P_final = (-1)^{L'}.

From earlier, P_final = (-1)^{l+1}.

So setting them equal:

(-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{l+1}.

Which implies that L' ≡ l +1 mod 2.

So L' = l +1 mod 2.

So L' and l have opposite parity.

So, for each option, we can get l (from the letter), then see what L' must be, and then check if S' and L' have opposite parity.

Wait, but without knowing S' and L', perhaps I can use the fact that in the final NN state, the spin state must be such that S' + L' is odd.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find out the possible parity of the final state, given l.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. Determine the parity of the final NN state (P_final) based on l.
   - P_final = (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{l+1}.

2. For each option, determine l from the emitted particle's state.
   - For example, option A: 7D1 → l=2.
   - Option B: 3S1 → l=0.
   - Option C: 3D3 → l=2.
   - Option D: 3P0 → l=1.

3. For each option, compute P_final = (-1)^{l+1}.
   - For l=2: P_final = (-1)^{3} = -1.
   - l=0: (-1)^1 = -1.
   - l=2: same as A, -1.
   - l=1: (-1)^2 = 1.

So for each option, P_final is:

A) -1
B) -1
C) -1
D) 1.

But, the parity of the final NN state is P_final. Also, since the NN state emits X, the parity of the final NN state must be a product of their orbital state.

Wait, but the parity is given by L', so P_final = (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state.

So from each option, we can get P_final and thus L' must satisfy (-1)^{L'} = P_final.

So for each option, l is known, and P_final is determined, allowing us to find L' mod 2.

Then, since in the final state, S' + L' must be 1 mod 2, we can check if it's possible.

Wait, but how do I get S'? S' is the spin of the final NN state. Since the initial state has S=0, and the process may involve a transition, perhaps the spin could change, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin state S' is determined by the process. For example, in the initial state, the two nucleons have S=0. After emitting X, perhaps the NN system's spin could change, but without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say. Maybe I can approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the emitted X's orbital angular momentum l affects the possible L' of the final NN state.

So, let's go through each option.

Option A: 7D1 → l=2.

So P_final = (-1)^{2+1} = (-1)^3 = -1 → (-1)^{L'} = -1 → L' is odd (since (-1)^L' is -1 when L' is odd).

So L' is odd.

In the final state, S' + L' must be 1 mod 2. So S' must be even (since L' is odd, S' must be even to make (even + odd)=odd → 1 mod 2).

So for the final state, S' must be even.

But what's the possible spin for the NN state? Well, two nucleons can have spin 0 or 1. So S' can be 0 (even) or 1 (odd).

So if S' is even (0), then L' must be odd (which it is for option A).

So for option A, it's possible.

Option B: 3S1 → l=0.

P_final = (-1)^{0+1} = (-1)^1 = -1 → L' is odd.

So, S' + L' must be 1 mod 2.

L' is odd, so S' must be even (since even + odd = odd → 1 mod 2).

So S' must be 0.

Is that possible? Yes, the final NN state can have S'=0.

So option B is possible.

Option C: 3D3 → l=2.

P_final = (-1)^(2+1) = (-1)^3 = -1 → L' is odd.

So S' must be even. So S'=0.

Possible, yes.

Option D: 3P0 → l=1.

P_final = (-1)^(1+1) = (-1)^2 = 1 → L' is even.

So L' is even.

In the final state, S' + L' must be 1 mod 2. Because 0 = S' + L' +1 mod 2 → S' + L' = 1.

Wait, wait. Earlier conclusion was that 0 = S' + L' +1 (mod 2) → S' + L' = 1 mod 2.

So for option D:

L' is even → L'=0 mod 2.

So S' must be 1 mod 2.

So S' must be odd → S'=1.

Which is possible for two nucleons (since S can be 1).

So all options are possible except one?

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So one of these options violates a condition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parity equation.

Let me recheck the parity equation.

The overall parity is conserved, so:

P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l.

P_initial for 1S0 is (-1)^L → L=0 → P_initial = 1.

P_X is given as intrinsic parity -1.

So,

1 = P_final * (-1) * (-1)^l.

Which simplifies to:

1 = P_final * (-1)^{l +1}.

So,

P_final = (-1)^{l +1}.

But P_final is also (-1)^{L'}, because the parity of the NN state is determined by L'.

So,

(-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{l +1}.

Which implies that L' ≡ l +1 mod 2.

So,

L' = l +1 mod 2.

So for each option:

A) l=2 → L' = 2 +1 =3 mod 2 → L'=1 mod 2. So L' is odd.

B) l=0 → L' =0 +1=1 mod 2. L' is odd.

C) l=2 → L'=1 mod 2. Odd.

D) l=1 → L' =1 +1=2 mod 2 → L'=0 mod 2. Even.

Now, in the final state, T = S' + L' +1 ≡0 mod 2.

Which is:

0 ≡ S' + L' +1 mod 2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod 2.

So,

S' ≡ 1 - L' mod 2.

So, for each option:

Option A: L'=1 (odd)

S' ≡1 -1 =0 mod2 → S' even.

So S'=0 or 2, but two nucleons can have S'=0 or 1. So S'=0 is allowed.

Option B: L'=1 → S' =0 mod2 → S'=0.

Allowed.

Option C: L'=1 → S'=0.

Possible.

Option D: L'=0 → S' ≡1 -0=1 mod2 → S'=1, which is allowed.

So all options are possible? That can't be right, because the question says one is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the spin. The initial state has S=0, but the final state could have S'=0 or 1. So for each option, in cases where S' is even, it's possible, and when odd, also possible.

Hmm, but what else could be the issue?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the NN system must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which affects the symmetry of the overall wavefunction.

The overall wavefunction is a product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts. Since the two nucleons are identical fermions, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange.

So the product of the spin, spatial, and isospin wavefunctions must be antisymmetric.

In the initial state (1S0), the spin is S=0 (symmetric?), the spatial part is L=0 (symmetric), and the isospin part is T=... Well, in the initial state, the isospin is part of the bound state. But after emission, the final state's isospin is T=0.

Wait, the initial state's isospin is T_initial. The final state has T=0. But how does emitting X affect the isospin?

Alternatively, perhaps the process involves the transition from an initial isospin state to a final isospin state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the isospin wavefunction symmetry may impose constraints on the spin and spatial parts.

Wait, since the final state has T=0, which is a singlet state, the isospin wavefunction is symmetric (or antisymmetric?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the isospin wavefunction for T=0 is symmetric or antisymmetric under exchange?

I think for two identical particles, the isospin singlet state (T=0) is symmetric. Because when T=0, the state is symmetric under exchange, similar to the spin singlet state.

Wait, no. The spin singlet state is antisymmetric (since S=0 for two spin-1/2 particles is antisymmetric under exchange). Hmm, perhaps the isospin part works similarly.

Wait, the isospin part for two identical particles: for T=0 (singlet), the wavefunction is symmetric under exchange.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. The isospin is part of the overall wavefunction. So for two identical particles, the isospin wavefunction must be either symmetric or antisymmetric, depending on the total state.

But regardless, perhaps the key is that the product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts must be antisymmetric.

In the final state, the NN pair has T=0. Let's think about the symmetry of the isospin part. For T=0, the isospin wavefunction is symmetric under exchange. Because the singlet state is symmetric. Because for two bosons, the singlet is symmetric, but for fermions, I'm not sure.

Wait, but the two nucleons are fermions. So the spin, spatial, and isospin parts must combine in such a way that the overall wavefunction is antisymmetric.

So, for the final state, T=0 (isospin singlet), which is symmetric under exchange. So the product of spin and spatial parts must be antisymmetric.

Thus, spin × spatial = antisymmetric.

So, if the spin part is symmetric (like S'=0), then the spatial part must be antisymmetric. Or if spin is antisymmetric (like S'=1, which is symmetric for two spin-1/2 particles?), wait, no:

Wait, the spin state for two particles is symmetric or antisymmetric. For S'=0 (singlet), it's antisymmetric. For S'=1 (triplet), symmetric.

So, for the final state, if the spin part is antisymmetric (S'=0), then the spatial part must be symmetric, because antisymmetric (spin) × symmetric (spatial) × symmetric (isospin) → overall antisymmetric.

Wait, let's break it down.

Overall wavefunction: ψ = ψ_spin × ψ_spatial × ψ_isospin.

Each part's symmetry:

- ψ_isospin (T=0): symmetric under exchange.
- ψ_spin (S'): for S'=0 → antisymmetric, S'=1 → symmetric.
- ψ_spatial (L').

The overall must be antisymmetric.

So,

ψ_spin × ψ_spatial = antisymmetric / ψ_isospin.

Since ψ_isospin is symmetric, ψ_spin × ψ_spatial must be antisymmetric.

So,

ψ_spin × ψ_spatial → antisymmetric.

Now, ψ_spatial's symmetry depends on L'. For even L' (s, d, g, ...), the spatial wavefunction is symmetric under exchange. For odd L' (p, f, ...), antisymmetric.

So,

ψ_spatial symmetry is (-1)^L'.

So, to have ψ_spin × ψ_spatial be antisymmetric, their product must be antisymmetric.

Which means:

ψ_spin_sym * ψ_spatial_sym = -1.

Where ψ_spin_sym is +1 (symmetric) or -1 (antisymmetric), same for ψ_spatial_sym.

So,

ψ_spin_sym * ψ_spatial_sym = -1.

Because the product must be antisymmetric (since the product must be -1 overall).

So,

ψ_spin_sym * (-1)^L' = -1.

Because ψ_spatial_sym is (-1)^L'.

So,

ψ_spin_sym * (-1)^L' = -1.

But ψ_spin_sym is +1 when S' is even (since, for two fermions, S'=0 → antisymmetric, which is ψ_spin_sym = -1? Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, for two identical spin-1/2 particles:

- S'=0: singlet → antisymmetric under exchange → ψ_spin_sym = -1.
- S'=1: triplet → symmetric → ψ_spin_sym = +1.

So ψ_spin_sym = (-1)^{S'}.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because S'=0 → spin wavefunction is antisymmetric → ψ_spin_sym = -1. So it's (-1)^{S'+1}?

Wait, perhaps a better way: for two spin-1/2 particles,

ψ_spin_sym = (-1)^{2S'}, because for S'=0, it's an antisymmetric state (symmetry factor -1), and for S'=1, symmetric (+1).

Wait,

For S'=0: (-1)^{2*0} = 1 → but ψ_spin_sym is -1.

Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin wavefunction symmetry is (-1)^{S'}. Because for S'=0, it's antisymmetric (so factor -1), and for S'=1, symmetric (so factor +1).

Wait, no. Because S'=0 gives a singlet, which is antisymmetric. So ψ_spin_sym = -1 for S'=0.

Similarly, S'=1 gives triplet, which is symmetric → ψ_spin_sym = +1.

So, ψ_spin_sym = (-1)^{S'}.

Wait, S'=0 → (-1)^0 =1. But that would imply symmetric for S'=0, which is wrong. So that can't be.

Hmm. Maybe it's (-1)^{2S'}, but that also doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the spin symmetry is given by (-1)^{S}.

Wait, for S'=0, it's (-1)^0=1 → symmetric, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (-1)^{S'+1}.

So,

S'=0 → (-1)^1 = -1 → antisymmetric.

S'=1 → (-1)^2=1 → symmetric.

That fits. So,

ψ_spin_sym = (-1)^{S' +1}.

Thus, ψ_spin × ψ_spatial must be antisymmetric, so:

ψ_spin_sym × ψ_spatial_sym = -1.

Which is:

(-1)^{S' +1} × (-1)^{L'} = -1.

So,

(-1)^{S' +1 + L'} = (-1)^1.

Which implies:

S' +1 + L' ≡1 mod2.

Simplifying,

S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

Wait, because 1 + (S' + L') ≡1 mod2 → S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

But earlier from the condition T = S + L +1 =0 mod2.

So,

S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

Wait, but from the spin and spatial symmetry condition, we get S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

So,

From T=0: S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

From symmetry condition: S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

These are contradictory unless both are satisfied, which only possible if 0 ≡1 mod2, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about ψ_spin_sym.

Let me think again: For two identical spin-1/2 particles,

- For S=0 (singlet), the spin wavefunction is antisymmetric: ψ_spin_sym = -1.
- For S=1 (triplet), symmetric: ψ_spin_sym = +1.

So ψ_spin_sym = (-1)^{S}.

Because for S=0 → (-1)^0=1 → but that's not correct. So this approach is not working.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (-1)^{S+1}.

For S=0: (-1)^1 = -1 → correct.

S=1: (-1)^2 =1 → correct.

Yes, that works.

So,

ψ_spin_sym = (-1)^{S' +1}.

We have ψ_spin_sym × ψ_spatial_sym = -1.

Because ψ_spatial_sym is (-1)^{L'}.

So,

(-1)^{S' +1} × (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{1}.

Which simplifies to:

(-1)^{S' +1 + L'} = (-1)^1.

So,

S' + 1 + L' ≡1 mod2 → S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

But from the Pauli condition given in the problem,

T = S + L +1 =0 mod2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

So,

S' + L' ≡0 mod2 (from symmetry) and S' + L' ≡1 mod2 (from T condition).

These are contradictory. So that's impossible.

Wait, so this suggests that the only way both can be true is if 0≡1 mod2, which is impossible. So that implies that the process is impossible under these conditions.

But the question states that the final state has T=0. So perhaps in this case, the process cannot proceed, but I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I derived the condition involving the spin and spatial wavefunction symmetry.

Wait, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So,

ψ_spin × ψ_spatial × ψ_isospin = antisymmetric.

Since ψ_isospin is symmetric (T=0), then ψ_spin × ψ_spatial must be antisymmetric.

So,

ψ_spin × ψ_spatial → antisymmetric.

Which means,

ψ_spin_sym × ψ_spatial_sym = -1.

Which is,

(-1)^{S' +1} × (-1)^{L'} = -1.

So,

(-1)^{S' +1 + L'} = (-1)^1 → S' +1 + L' ≡1 mod2 → S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

But from the problem's condition,

S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

So, S' + L' must be both even and odd, which is impossible. So this suggests that the process is impossible, which can't be the case.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm mixing up the isospin condition.

Wait, the given condition in the problem is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod2). So T= S + L +1 mod2.

In the final state, T=0, so,

0 = S' + L' +1 mod2 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

But from the spin and spatial symmetry condition, S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

These are conflicting. So this suggests that for the given conditions, the process is impossible.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the problem arises because one of the options leads to S' + L' being even, which contradicts the condition from T=0.

Wait, but earlier, for each option, I computed L' based on l.

Now, for each option, I can compute S' + L' and see if it's 1 mod2.

Let me go through each option again.

Option A: l=2.

L' = l +1 mod2 = 3 mod2 → L'=1.

From the condition, S' + L' ≡1 → S' must be 0 mod2 (even).

So S'=0.

Now, from the spin and spatial condition, S' + L' ≡0 mod2 → 0 +1 ≡1 → which is 1 mod2, which doesn't equal 0 mod2.

So this would be a contradiction.

So option A cannot be allowed.

But wait, earlier when I checked the options, I thought that option A was permitted. But according to this, it's not.

Wait, because the spin and spatial condition requires S' + L' ≡0 mod2, but the T condition requires S' + L' ≡1 mod2. So it's impossible.

So this suggests that for all options, the process is impossible, which can't be the case.

But the question says which option is not permitted. So perhaps only one option leads to this contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the spin and spatial condition.

Wait, let me re-express the conditions:

1. From T condition: S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

2. From spin and spatial symmetry: S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

These are incompatible, so the process cannot happen.

But that's not possible because the question states that the final state exists with T=0.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the spin and spatial symmetry condition.

Wait, perhaps the spin and spatial symmetry condition is S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

Wait, let me go back.

The overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric.

ψ = ψ_spin × ψ_spatial × ψ_isospin.

ψ_isospin is symmetric (T=0).

So, ψ_spin × ψ_spatial must be antisymmetric, which means their product's symmetry is -1.

So,

ψ_spin_sym × ψ_spatial_sym = -1.

But ψ_spin_sym is (-1)^{S' +1}.

ψ_spatial_sym is (-1)^{L'}.

So,

(-1)^{S' +1} × (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{1}.

Which simplifies to,

(-1)^{S' +1 + L'} = (-1)^1 → exponents must be equal mod2.

So,

S' +1 + L' ≡1 → S' + L' ≡0 mod2.

So,

From T condition: S' + L' ≡1.

From spin-spatial: S' + L' ≡0.

So, impossible. The only way both are true is if 0≡1 mod2, which is impossible.

So, this suggests that the process is not possible, but the question implies that one option is not allowed.

Wait, but the question says "the final NN state has T=0." So perhaps the process is allowed, but only for certain l's.

Wait, perhaps the initial state's isospin affects this. If the initial state's isospin is T_initial, and X carries away some isospin, perhaps the final state's isospin T_final is zero.

But I'm not considering that in the current approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the conservation of isospin. But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity equation is correct, and the T condition is correct, but the spin and spatial condition is automatically satisfied.

Wait, but the conclusion was that S' + L' must be both 0 and 1 mod2, which is impossible. So this suggests that no such process is possible, but the question gives options implying one is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the spin and spatial symmetry analysis.

Wait, perhaps the spin and spatial parts have a symmetry that, when multiplied, gives (-1)^{S' + L'}, not just (-1)^{S'} × (-1)^{L'}.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is (-1)^{S'} × (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{S' + L'}.

Which would mean, for the product to be -1,

(-1)^{S' + L'} = -1 → S' + L' must be odd → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

Which aligns with the T condition, which also requires S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

So the conditions are compatible.

Wait, this is different from my earlier conclusion.

So, let's reevaluate.

If ψ_spin × ψ_spatial must be antisymmetric, then:

ψ_spin_sym × ψ_spatial_sym = -1.

Which is,

(-1)^{S'} × (-1)^{L'} = -1 → (-1)^{S' + L'} = -1 → S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

Which matches the T condition.

So, the two conditions are the same.

So, no contradiction arises. So, the conditions are compatible.

Therefore, the earlier issue was incorrect; the conditions are consistent.

So, the problem is to find which option leads to a situation where S' + L' is 1 mod2, and the parity and angular momentum conditions are satisfied.

But all the options satisfy the S' + L' condition, so perhaps another factor is at play.

Wait, perhaps the initial state's angular momentum is J=0, and the final state must have J' such that J' + l =0.

But since J is a vector, perhaps the only way this is possible is if J' = l, but in the opposite direction. But since l is a non-negative integer, J' must be equal to l, and the total angular momentum adds to zero.

Wait, that's only possible if l=0, but that's not the case for all options.

Wait, no. The initial state has J=0. The final NN state has J', and the emitted X has l.

Conservation of angular momentum requires that J_initial = J' + l.

But J_initial is 0, so J' + l must be zero. But since J' and l are non-negative integers, this is only possible if J'=0 and l=0, or J'=l=0.

But that's not the case for any options except option B (l=0), which would require J'=0.

Wait, but J' is the total angular momentum of the final NN state, which includes both their spin and orbital contributions. So J' = |S' - L'| to |S' + L'| in steps of 2. But for initial J=0, the sum J' + l must be zero, which for non-negative integers only allows J'=0 and l=0.

But that would imply that only option B (l=0) is possible, which is not the case because other options have l>0.

Hmm, this is a problem. Because the initial J is 0, and J' + l must sum to zero, which is only possible if J'=0 and l=0.

But that can't be, because other options have l>0.

This suggests that the process is impossible unless l=0, which would mean only option B is allowed, but the question states that one is not permitted, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is not part of the angular momentum of the NN system but is a separate part. So the total angular momentum J_initial = J_final_NN + L_X.

So J_initial = J_final_NN + L_X.

So, 0 = J_final_NN + l.

Which implies that J_final_NN = - l.

But angular momentum is a vector, so the magnitude |J_final_NN| must be equal to l, and the direction opposite. So J_final_NN can have a magnitude l.

But the possible values of J_final_NN are determined by S' and L' via |S' - L'| ≤ J' ≤ |S' + L'|.

So for each option, we have l, and thus J_final_NN must have magnitude l. So J_final_NN can be l, l-1, ..., down to |S' - L'|.

Wait, perhaps I should think of J_final_NN as being l, but also compatible with S' and L'.

So, for each option, let's see if J_final_NN can be l.

But this might be getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the option where l is even, which would cause L' to be odd, but then S' must be even, which may or may not be possible.

Wait, earlier from parity, we have L' = l +1 mod2.

So, for each option:

Option A: l=2 → L'=1 (odd).

S' must be even (0) → possible.

So J' can be any even number? Hmm.

But the actual J' is J_final_NN, which must be such that J_final_NN = l → for option A, J'=2.

But J' is determined by S' and L' → J' can range from |S' - L'| to S' + L', in steps of 2.

S'=0, L'=1 → J' can be 1 (since |0-1|=1 and 0+1=1 → J'=1).

But J' must equal l=2 → but J' can't be 2 because S'=0 and L'=1 → max J' is 1.

So this is impossible. So option A is not permitted.

Similarly, let's check option B: l=0.

L' = 0 +1 mod2 → L'=1.

But wait, for l=0, L'=1 mod2 → L'=1.

But wait, earlier when l=0, from the parity condition, P_final = (-1)^{0+1} = -1 → L' is odd. So L'=1.

Now, J_final_NN must be l=0.

But with S'=0 (since S' + L'=1 → S'=0), and L'=1, the possible J' is 1.

So J'=1 must equal l=0 → impossible.

Wait, but J' must be 0, but for S'=0 and L'=1, J' can only be 1.

So this is impossible. So option B is not permitted.

Wait, this is confusing. Because earlier analysis with parity and T condition suggested that options A and B were allowed, but now with the angular momentum conservation, they are not.

Option C: l=2 → L'=1.

J_final_NN must be 2.

With S'=0, L'=1 → possible J' is 1. So J' can't be 2 → impossible.

So option C is invalid.

Option D: l=1 → L'=0.

So J_final_NN must be 1.

With S'=1 (since S' + L'=1 → S'=1 because L'=0).

So S'=1, L'=0 → J' can be 1.

So J'=1, which equals l=1 → allowed.

So only option D is permitted.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is NOT permitted. So options A, B, C are not allowed. But the question gives four options, so perhaps only one is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the angular momentum part.

Wait, for option A: l=2.

Emitting X with l=2. So J_final_NN must be 2? Because J_initial =0 = J_final_NN + l → J_final_NN = -l → magnitude l.

But with S'=0, L'=1 → J' can be 1. So J'=2 is not possible → option A invalid.

Option B: l=0 → J_final_NN=0.

With S'=0, L'=1 → J' can be 1. So 0 is not possible → invalid.

Option C: l=2 → J'=2. S'=0, L'=1 → J' can only be 1 → invalid.

Option D: l=1 → J'=1. S'=1, L'=0 → J' can be 1 → allowed.

So only option D is allowed, meaning the other options are not permitted. But the question asks which is not permitted.

Wait, but the question says which is not permitted, so the answer would be options A, B, and C. But the options only give A, B, C, D as choices, and the correct answer is the one that is not allowed.

But according to this, options A, B, C are not allowed, and D is allowed. So the question is which of the options is not permitted. So the answer would be A, B, or C.

But the problem states that the initial state is 1S0, which has J=0. So the final NN state must have J'= l, but according to the possible J' for each option:

Only option D can have J'=1, which matches l=1.

So the other options have l=2 or 0, which don't match J' possibilities.

Therefore, options A, B, C are not permitted, but the question gives four options, and only one is the correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in this analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the angular momentum is not considered in this way.

Wait, perhaps the emitted X carries away angular momentum, but the NN system's angular momentum is not necessarily equal to l. Instead, the total angular momentum (NN + X) must be conserved from the initial J=0.

But that's more complicated, involving coupling of angular momenta, which might be beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to focus on the parity and the T condition, not the angular momentum conservation beyond what's provided by the partial wave.

But according to the earlier analysis, the only option that doesn't violate the T condition and the spin-spatial symmetry condition is option D.

Wait, but according to the angular momentum condition, only option D is allowed.

Therefore, the other options (A, B, C) are not permitted. But the question asks which is not permitted, so the answer is among them.

But looking back at the options, option D is 3P0 + s. So l=1.

If only option D is allowed, then the others are not permitted. But the question asks which is not permitted, so the answer would be options A, B, C.

But the problem gives four options, and the answer must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me quickly recap.

The key points are:

1. The initial state has J=0.

2. The final state must have J' such that J' + l =0 → J' = -l. So the magnitude |J'| = l.

3. For the final state (NN), J' is determined by their S' and L' via |S' - L'| ≤ J' ≤ S' + L'.

4. The parity condition requires that L' = l +1 mod2.

5. The T condition requires S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

So, for each option:

Option A: l=2 → L'=1 (mod2). J' must be 2.

S' + L' ≡1 → S'=0.

So S'=0, L'=1 → J' can be 1.

But requires J'=2 → impossible. So option A not allowed.

Option B: l=0 → L'=1. J' must be 0.

S'=0, L'=1 → J' can be 1. So 0 is impossible → option B not allowed.

Option C: l=2 → L'=1. J' must be 2.

S'=0, L'=1 → J'=1 → impossible → option C not allowed.

Option D: l=1 → L'=0. J' must be 1.

S'=1 (since S' + L'=1 → S'=1), L'=0 → J' can be 1 → allowed.

So only option D is allowed. Therefore, the other options (A, B, C) are not permitted.

But the problem asks which is not permitted, and the options are A, B, C, D. So the answer would be options A, B, C.

But the problem states that the final NN state has T=0, which is possible only for option D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 1S0 →7D1 + p → l=2.

B) →3S1 + p → l=0.

C) →3D3 + f → l=2.

D) →3P0 + s → l=1.

So, according to the analysis, only option D is allowed. Therefore, the other options are not permitted. But the question is which is not permitted. So the answer is any of the other options.

But the question asks which is not permitted. So if the correct answer is D, but according to the analysis, D is allowed, then perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the emitted X's orbital angular momentum is not part of the NN's angular momentum, but rather, the process involves the NN system's angular momentum changing as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state has some orbital angular momentum that I'm not considering. But the initial state is 1S0, which has L=0.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct approach is to find that only option D is allowed, so the other options are not. But the problem says that one option is not permitted, so the answer is one of the others.

Alternatively, perhaps the parity condition leads to a contradiction for some options.

Let me check the parity for each option.

Option A: l=2.

P_final = (-1)^{2+1}= -1 → L'=1.

So for final NN state, L'=1 → parity (-1)^1 = -1.

Which matches P_final = -1.

So parity is satisfied.

Option B: l=0.

P_final = (-1)^{0+1} = -1 → L'=1.

So parity is (-1)^1 = -1. So the final NN state has parity -1 → okay.

Option C: l=2 → same as A.

P_final=-1 → L'=1 → parity -1 → okay.

Option D: l=1.

P_final= (-1)^{1+1}=1 → L'=0.

So parity is (-1)^0=1 → matches.

So all options satisfy the parity condition.

Thus, the only possible issue is the angular momentum condition regarding J'.

So, the conclusion is that only option D is permitted, so the others are not allowed. But the question is which is not permitted. So the answer would be any of the others.

But the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be the options that don't allow J' to be l.

So options A, B, and C don't allow J' to be l, thus are not permitted.

But the problem gives the options, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think again about the initial state: it's 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0.

But when X is emitted, the final NN state has T=0.

Wait, perhaps for some options, the final state's S' and L' can't satisfy S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

But earlier analysis showed that for all options, S' + L' ≡1 is satisfied.

Wait, perhaps the mistake lies in the condition T = S + L +1 mod2.

Wait, the problem states that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod2.

So,

T = S + L +1 mod2.

Which for T=0:

0 = S + L +1 → S+L=1 mod2 → S and L have opposite parity.

So in the final state, S' and L' must have opposite parity.

So for each option, S' and L' must have opposite parity.

Let me check for each option.

Option A: l=2 → L'=1 (odd). So S' must be even (0).

So S' =0 → even.

So, possible.

Option B: l=0 → L'=1 (odd). S'=0 → even. Possible.

Option C: l=2 → L'=1 (odd). S'=0 → even. Possible.

Option D: l=1 → L'=0 (even). S'=1 → odd. Possible.

So all options satisfy S' and L' having opposite parity.

Thus, the only issue left is the angular momentum.

So, only option D can have J'=1, which matches l=1.

The others have l=2 or 0, which don't match J' possibilities.

So, the other options are not allowed.

Thus, the answer must be one of the options A, B, C.

But the question asks which is not permitted. So, among the options, the one that doesn't allow J' to be l is the answer.

So, which of A, B, C doesn't allow J' = l → those are not permitted.

But the question is which one is not permitted, and the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 3D3 + f.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because l=2 and J'=2 is impossible.

But I'm not certain. Based on the analysis, the only allowed option is D. So the others are not permitted. The question asks which is not permitted, but I can't choose all. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Another angle: the intrinsic parity of X is -1. So when X is emitted in a state with orbital angular momentum l, the parity of the process is (-1)^l * intrinsic parity of X.

So overall parity must be conserved.

The initial state's parity is 1 (since L=0).

The final state's parity is (-1)^{L'}, and the emitted X's parity is (-1)^{l} * (-1) (since intrinsic parity is -1).

So,

1 = (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l} * (-1).

Simplify:

1 = (-1)^{L' + l} * (-1).

Multiply both sides by (-1):

-1 = (-1)^{L' + l}.

Which implies that L' + l is odd → L' + l ≡1 mod2.

But from earlier, L' ≡ l +1 mod2 → substituting,

(l+1) + l ≡1 → 2l +1 ≡1 mod2 → 2l ≡0 → l ≡0 mod1.

Which is always true since l is integer.

So, no additional constraint from this.

But perhaps this doesn't help.

Another approach: the Pauli exclusion principle requires that the isospin, spin, and orbital parts combine to make the overall wavefunction antisymmetric.

But perhaps I'm going in circles here.

Given the time I've spent and the analysis, I think the correct answer is option C: 3D3 + f is not permitted.


The problem involves a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a \( ^1S_0 \) state emitting a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \(-1\). The final NN state has total isospin \( T = 0 \), and the angular momentum and spin quantum numbers of the final state must satisfy \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \). The task is to determine which partial wave is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum, parity, and the given conditions.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state is \( ^1S_0 \), which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = 1 \).

2. **Final State**: The final NN state has \( T = 0 \), and the emitted particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \(-1\). The parity of the final NN state is \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L'} \), where \( L' \) is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. The parity conservation condition is:
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^l,
   \]
   where \( l \) is the orbital angular momentum of \( X \). Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = 1 \), \( P_X = -1 \), and \( P_{\text{final}} = (-1)^{L'} \), we find:
   \[
   1 = (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^l \implies (-1)^{L'} = (-1)^{l + 1}.
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   L' \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]

3. **Pauli Condition**: The condition \( T = S + L + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) must be satisfied for the final state. Since \( T = 0 \), this simplifies to:
   \[
   S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2).
   \]
   Thus, \( S \) and \( L \) must have opposite parity in the final state.

4. **Angular Momentum Conservation**: The initial state has \( J = 0 \). After emitting \( X \), the total angular momentum of the system (NN + \( X \)) must satisfy:
   \[
   J_{\text{initial}} = J_{\text{final, NN}} + l.
   \]
   Since \( J_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), the final NN state must have \( J' = -l \), where \( J' \) is the total angular momentum of the NN state. The possible values of \( J' \) are determined by \( S' \) and \( L' \) through the relation:
   \[
   |S' - L'| \leq J' \leq S' + L'.
   \]

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^7D_1 + p \)**
- \( l = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
- From parity conservation: \( L' \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) (odd).
- From \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), \( S' \) must be even (\( S' = 0 \)).
- Possible \( J' \): For \( S' = 0 \) and \( L' = 1 \), \( J' \) can only be 1. However, \( J' \) must equal \( l = 2 \), which is impossible.  
**Conclusion**: Not permitted.

#### **Option B: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^3S_1 + p \)**

- From \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), \( S' \) must be even (\( S' = 0 \)).
- Possible \( J' \): For \( S' = 0 \) and \( L' = 1 \), \( J' \) can only be 1. However, \( J' \) must equal \( l = 0 \), which is impossible.  
**Conclusion**: Not permitted.

#### **Option C: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^3D_3 + f \)**
- \( l = 2 \) (from \( D \)).
- From parity conservation: \( L' \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies L' \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) (odd).
- From \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), \( S' \) must be even (\( S' = 0 \)).
- Possible \( J' \): For \( S' = 0 \) and \( L' = 1 \), \( J' \) can only be 1. However, \( J' \) must equal \( l = 2 \), which is impossible.  
**Conclusion**: Not permitted.

#### **Option D: \( ^1S_0 \to {}^3P_0 + s \)**
- \( l = 1 \) (from \( P \)).
- From parity conservation: \( L' \equiv l + 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \implies L' \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \) (even).
- From \( S + L \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod} \, 2) \), \( S' \) must be odd (\( S' = 1 \)).
- Possible \( J' \): For \( S' = 1 \) and \( L' = 0 \), \( J' \) can be 1, which matches \( l = 1 \).  
**Conclusion**: Permitted.

### Final Answer:
The partial wave that is not permitted is **Option C**.  
**Answer: C**
