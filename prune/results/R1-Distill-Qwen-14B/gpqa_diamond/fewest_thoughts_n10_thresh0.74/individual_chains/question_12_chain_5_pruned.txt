Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. It's about particle physics, specifically pion decay. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question gives me a reaction: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). 

The rest masses are given. Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, but I think in these kinds of problems, sometimes the rest mass of the neutrino is considered zero. Or maybe it's negligible? I'm not entirely sure, but I'll proceed with that assumption unless told otherwise.

The question asks for the kinetic energy of the product particles. So, the products are mu(+) and nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So, after the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. That's an important point.

Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So, E_initial = m_pi c^2 = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the neutrino's rest mass is zero, its energy is just its kinetic energy plus any rest mass energy, which is zero. Wait, but the muon has rest mass, so its energy will be its kinetic energy plus its rest energy.

So, E_final = E_mu + E_nu. 

But I also know that momentum must be conserved. Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p, then the neutrino's momentum is -p (since they're moving in opposite directions). So, the magnitudes are the same, but directions are opposite.

The energy of each particle is given by their respective energies. For the muon, E_mu^2 = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Since the neutrino's mass is zero, E_nu = p c.

So, the total energy E_final is [sqrt( (p c)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) ] + (p c). And this must equal 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, this seems like a system of equations. But maybe there's a simpler approach. Oh wait, when a particle at rest decays into two particles, their energies and momenta are related in a specific way. 

I remember that in such cases, the energies can be found using the invariant quantity. The square of the total energy is (sum of four-momenta)^2. But maybe that's more complicated than I need right now.

Alternatively, considering that the sum of the energies is the rest energy of the pion, and the sum of their momenta is zero. So, the energies are related to their masses and momenta.

Let me denote the momentum of the muon as p. Since the neutrino's mass is zero, its
