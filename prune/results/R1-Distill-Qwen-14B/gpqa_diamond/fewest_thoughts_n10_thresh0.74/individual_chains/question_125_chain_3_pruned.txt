Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me think through it. Alright, the question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². Oh wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, that's a harmonic oscillator potential. So this is similar to the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator problem.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for the same energy eigenvalue. Hmm.

I remember that in the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but since it's isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of these. Oh wait, no, wait. I think the energy levels can be expressed in terms of the principal quantum number n, which is related to the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, actually, another approach. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (n=0,1,2,...). But wait, I think that might not be exactly right. Let me think again. No, wait. No, in 3D, the energy is E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2) ħω. But since the oscillator is isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers. So the states are deg
