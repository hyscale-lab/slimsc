Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I need to think about how light behaves when the medium is moving relative to an observer. Let me try to break it down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass is normally c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So normally, without any movement, the speed would be c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so I guess I have to consider the motion of the medium affecting the speed as observed.

But wait, how do moving media affect the speed of light? I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But this isn't a vacuum; it's a medium with an index of refraction. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it in terms of Galilean transformations because velocities are low compared to the speed of light. Oh wait, but even in Galilean transformations, light's speed doesn't just add like regular objects. Let me think.

Wait, when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of light? Suppose the medium is moving at velocity v. The light's speed in the medium is
