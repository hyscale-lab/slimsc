Okay, so I've got this physics problem about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through. Alright, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, phase shifts are part of the scattering amplitude, right? Oh yeah, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be written in terms of partial waves, each associated with a phase shift. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l P_l(cosθ) ) ), where δ_l are the phase shifts and P_l are Legendre polynomials.

But the question specifies the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ = 0 degrees. Oh wait, so I'm looking for the imaginary part of f(0). Let me think about f(0) in terms of the partial waves.

The incident beam is along the direction θ=0, so cosθ=1. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for any l, right? So each term becomes (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l * 1, all multiplied by 1/(2ik).

Wait, and the imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum over all l of [ (2l+1) * (1/(2ik)) * Im( e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ) ]. Because when you take the imaginary part, it's linear, so you can distribute it.

But wait, e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l = sinδ_l cosδ_l + i sin^2 δ_l. The imaginary part would be sin^2 δ_l.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the phase shifts given are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest, so probably l=0 to 4.

So for each l from 0 to 4, compute (2l+1) * sin^2 δ_l, sum them up, multiply by 1/(2ik), and that's the imaginary part.

Wait, but what is k? Oh, k is the wave number. Which is related to the momentum of the electron. The energy is given as 50 MeV. Hmm, I need to compute k.

The electrons are non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is a pretty high energy. Wait, electrons have rest mass about
