Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this genetics question, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll walk through my thoughts step by step.

So the question is about gene interactions in white lupine concerning resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. We have three genes: G1, G2, G3. The experiment involves creating knockout mutants and double-mutants, then testing their resistance.

The results are given as percentages of the control's resistance. The control is 100% resistant, which I guess means the wild-type. The mutants show varying levels of resistance.

From the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, the mutant is less resistant than wild type, but not as bad as others.
- g2: 0% resistance. So this plant is completely susceptible; can't resist the pathogen at all.
- g3: 50% resistance. So halfway between the wild type and no resistance.
- g1g3: 10% resistance. Hmm, that's really low.
- g2g3: 0% again. So same as g2 alone.
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone.

The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So the hierarchy probably matters here.

I remember that in gene interaction, if a gene is epistatic to another, its mutation can mask the effect of the other. For example, if G2 is epistatic to G1, then a mutation in G2 would determine the phenotype regardless of G1's state.

Looking at the data, when G2 is mutated (g2), the resistance is 0%. Same when we have any double mutant involving G2, like g1g2 or g2g3. So in all cases where G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is necessary for resistance. Because even if another gene, like G1, is knocked out, as long as G2 is present, perhaps there's some resistance. Wait no, because when G2 is present, like in wild type, the resistance is 100%.

Wait, the mutants without G2 all have 0% resistance. But when G2 is present, like in g1, which only has G1 knocked out, the resistance is 75%â€”so that's better than the 50% of g3. So without G2, resistance plummets, but without G1, it's still 75%. So G2 must be more critical.

So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, since it's upstream. Because when G2 is knocked out, everything fails. And when G1 is knocked out, it's still partially functional.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream. But let's think about epistasis.

In the double mutants, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. That's worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So when both are knocked out, the effect is more severe than either single knockout. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps acting redundantly. Because if both are out, the function is more impaired than either alone.

Wait, what's gene redundancy? It's when two genes can perform the same function. So if you lose both, the effect is worse than if you lose just one.

So in the case of g1g3 being 10%, which is worse than either single mutant, it suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant. So knocking out both makes the situation much worse than either alone.

Alternatively, if they were in separate pathways, then the double mutant might have some residual function. But in this case, it's worse, so maybe they are in the same pathway and can compensate for each other.

But wait, another way to
