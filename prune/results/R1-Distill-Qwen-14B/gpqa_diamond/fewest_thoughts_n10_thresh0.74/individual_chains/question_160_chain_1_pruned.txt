Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining on it along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark regions called the diffraction pattern. The far field region means we can use the Fraunhofer diffraction approximation. Fraunhofer diffraction occurs when the observation plane is far away from the aperture, so the pattern is at a large distance, and the light rays are nearly parallel.

Wait, the problem says N is infinitely large. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon becomes indistinguishable from a circle. So the problem is essentially about a circular aperture, but let me think again. No, wait, the apothem is the same for all sides. In a regular polygon, the apothem (the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side) is related to the radius of the circumscribed circle. But if all apothems are the same length 'a', then as N approaches infinity, the shape approaches a circle with radius equal to the apothem. Or wait, no, in a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' is given by a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius. As N becomes large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So the radius of the circle would be approximately 'a'.

So the problem is effectively about the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture when N is very large. But wait, the options don't have the standard sin(π a sinθ / λ) = 0 condition. Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the minima occur when a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. But wait, the first minima would be at m=1, giving sinθ ≈ λ/(a), assuming small angles where sinθ ≈ tanθ ≈ θ. But wait, the question is about the first two minima. Wait, the first minima is at m=1, the second at m=2. So the angular distance between them would be θ2 - θ1. But wait, I
