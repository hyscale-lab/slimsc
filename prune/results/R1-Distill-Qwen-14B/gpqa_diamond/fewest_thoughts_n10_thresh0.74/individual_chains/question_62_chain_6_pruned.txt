Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let's see what the target molecule is: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. The main part is a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it, there's a carbaldehyde group (CHO), which means it's an aldehyde. Then, attached to the same carbon as the aldehyde, there's a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. Wait, no, the substituents are on the cyclohexane. Let me parse the name again.

The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the cyclohexane ring has a carbaldehyde group (so at position 1, maybe?), and the same carbon (position 1) has a substituent that's cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Wait, no. Let me think: the substituents are on the cyclohexane. So the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is at position 1 of the cyclohexane. Then, the same carbon (position 1) has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group attached. So that's a branch: a methyl group with a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group attached. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde at C1 and a CH group attached to C1, which has a cyclohexyl group and an OH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally. The cyclohexane ring, let's say position 1 has two substituents: one is the aldehyde (CHO), and the other is a CH group. That CH group is connected to a cyclohexyl group (from cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) and an OH group. So the substituent is -(CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)).

So the target molecule has two rings: the main cyclohexane and a substituent which
