Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking for.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator P is related to the spin of the particle. Since the muon is involved, which is a lepton like an electron but heavier, but that probably doesn't affect the calculation here. The operator components are given for P_x, P_y, and P_z, each as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right, the spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle (like an electron or muon) are given by S_x, S_y, S_z, each multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P might be the spin operator here. But in this problem, it's called operator P, not S, but I think that's just a name. So P probably represents the spin angular momentum operator.

The direction given is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n has components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. The eigenvector we're looking for corresponds to the eigenvalue +ħ/2, which would be the eigenvalue for spin-up along that direction. 

The question is asking for the elements of the normalized eigenvector. The options are given, so perhaps I can find the form of the eigenvector and match it to the options.

So the operator P is given in terms of its components. Let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P here is a vector operator, and the total operator along direction n would be P · n = nx P_x + nz P_z. Because since the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so ny=0. So the operator we're considering is P_n = nx P_x + nz P_z.

We need to find the eigenvector of P_n with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So let me define P_n as:

P_n = nx (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out ħ/2:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ nx [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So the matrix inside is:

[ nz, nx ]
[ nx, -nz ]

Wait, because when you multiply nx by the [[0,1],[1,0]] matrix, you get [[0, nx],[nx, 0]], and adding nz*[[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[nz, 0], [0, -nz]] + [[0, nx],[nx, 0]] = [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. So the matrix is:

[ nz, nx ]
[ nx, -nz ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it again. Oh wait, no, the matrix would be:

nx * [[0,1],[1,0]] is [[0*nx, nx*1], [nx*1, 0*nx]] = [[0, nx], [nx, 0]]
nz * [[1,0],[0,-1]] is [[nz*1, 0], [0, -nz]]
So adding them together gives:
[ nz, nx ]
[ nx, -nz ]

So the matrix is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]], multiplied by ħ/2. So when we write P_n, it's (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

We need to find the eigenvector of this matrix corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Wait, no. Wait, P_n is (ħ/2) multiplied by the matrix M, where M is [[nz, nx], [nx, -nz]]. So the eigenvalue equation is (ħ/2) M |v> = (ħ/2) |v> ?

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (eigenvalue) |v>. So given that the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, we have:

(ħ/2) * M |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

M |v> = |v>

So M |v> = 1 * |v>
