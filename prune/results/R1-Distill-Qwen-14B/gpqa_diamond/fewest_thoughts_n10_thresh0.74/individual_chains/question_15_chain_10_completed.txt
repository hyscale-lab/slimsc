Okay, so I've got this question about which planet to observe for transits, and I need to figure out which one has a higher probability. Hmm, right, the transit method detects planets when they pass in front of their star, blocking some light. The probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight.

The question says both planets have the same mass. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P days, Planet_1's is P/3. Wait, but orbital period relates to the size of the orbit. Since they're both around different stars, though.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but wait, both stars have the same radius. Oh, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. So, same radius but different masses. Interesting.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting is given by R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the star, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So P ∝ a^3/(M_star) from Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M_star + m_planet)) * a³. But since the planet mass is much smaller, we can approximate M_star + m ≈ M_star. So P² ∝ a³ / M_star.

So a³ = (G(M_star + m_planet) ) P²/(4π²). But since M_planet is much smaller, a³ ≈ (G M_star) P²/(4 π²). So a ∝ (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(2/3).

But wait, we're dealing with the probability of transit, which is (R_star / a). So we can write transit probability as (R_star) / a.

We can express a in terms of the period and mass. Let me think about the parameters:

For Planet_1:
Mass of star, M1 = 2 M2 (since M1 is twice M2)
Orbital period, P1 = P2 / 3 (since P1 is three times shorter, so P1 = P2/3.)

So a1³ = (G M1) (P1)^2 / (4 π²)
Similarly, a2³ = (G M2) (P2)^2 / (4 π²)

Let me write a1 in terms of a2.

We can take the ratio a1/a2.

Let's compute (a1/a2)³ = [ (M1 * P1²) / M2 * P2² ) ]

M1 is 2 M2, and P1 is (1/3) P2.

So (a1/a2)^3 = (2 M2 * ( (P2/3)^2 )) / ( M2 * P2² ) )

Simplifying numerator: 2 M2 * (P2² /9 ) = (2 M2 P2² ) /9 

Denominator: M2 P2²

So (a1/a2)^3 = (2/9 ) / 1 = 2/9.

Taking cube roots: a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) = cube root of 2/(9) ≈ 0.5848.

So a1 is about 0.5848 times a2.

Now, the transit probability is R_star / a for each planet. But both stars have the same radius, R1 = R2 = R.

So probability_1 = R / a1

Probability_2 = R / a2

So the ratio (probability_1 / probability_2) = (R/a1) / (R/a2) ) = a2 / a1 = 1/(a1/a2) = 1/0.5848 ≈ 1.709.

So probability_1 is about 1.709 times probability_2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because a1 is smaller than a2. Since a1 is 0.5848 a2, then R/a1 is larger than R/a2. So yes, Planet_1's probability is higher.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because a1 is smaller, which makes R/a1 larger, so higher probability. So the ratio is probability_1 / probability_2 = a2 / a1 ≈ 1.709.

So probability_1 is about 1.7 times higher than probability_2. So Planet_1 is preferred.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher. Option D says 2.7 times.

Hmm, my calculation came to about 1.709, so approximately 1.7 times. So which option is closer? The options are:

A) Planet_2, 2.25x

B) Planet_2, 1.5x

C) Planet_1, ~1.65x

D) Planet_1, ~2.7x

I got about 1.7, which is close to option C's 1.65. Maybe I approximated the cube roots.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3).

2/9 ≈ 0.2222.

Cube root of 0.2222.

I know that 0.6³=0.216, which is close. 0.6^3 =0.216. 0.6^3 is 0.216, 0.61^3 is about 0.226, 0.605^3 is ?

Wait, 0.6^3=0.216

0.605^3 = (0.6 +0.005)^3 ≈ 0.6^3 + 3*(0.6)^2 *0.005 = 0.216 + 3*(0.36)(0.005) = 0.216 + 0.0054 = 0.2214.

0.605^3 ≈ 0.2214. But 2/9 is 0.2222. So a1/a2 = approx 0.605.

So a1/a2 = 0.605.

So a2/a1 = 1/0.605 ≈ 1.6529.

So probability_1 / probability_2 = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

Ah, so the calculation comes to about 1.65. So option C says 1.65 times, and says Planet_1 is preferred.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability, which is given by:

\[
P_{\text{transit}} = \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}
\]

where \( R_{\text{star}} \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_1 = R_2 = R \)), the transit probability depends on the semi-major axis \( a \), which can be derived from Kepler's third law:

\[
P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_{\text{star}}}
\]

Rearranging, we find:

\[
a \propto \left(M_{\text{star}}\right)^{1/3} P^{2/3}
\]

### Step 1: Compare the semi-major axes of the two planets
For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Taking the ratio of the semi-major axes:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1}{M_2}\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Substituting \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) and \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \):

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{1}\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{1/3}{1}\right)^{2/3}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = 2^{1/3} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{2/3}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \).

### Step 2: Compare the transit probabilities
The transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), so:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( a_1 \approx 0.605a_2 \):

\[
\frac{P_{\text{transit,1}}}{P_{\text{transit,2}}} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred; Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the transit probability ratio is not 1.5.
- **Option C**: Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the transit probability ratio is approximately 1.65.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Planet_1 is preferred, but the transit probability ratio is not 2.7.

### Final Answer:
Planet_1 is preferred due to its approximately 1.65 times higher probability to transit.
