Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm. Let's see what the question is.

The chemist found a white solid, and we've got to figure out what it is using the given spectral information. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through each piece of data step by step.

First, the mass spec. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and then there's a peak at 158 with 32% intensity. So, the molecular weight is around 156. The other peak is 158, which is two units higher. That makes me think about possible adducts or maybe a chlorine substitution because Cl often adds about 2 mass units when considering the molecular ion. Wait, but waitâ€”chlorine has an atomic mass of around 35.5, so if a molecule has Cl, the molecular ion would be higher by 35.5, but here it's 156. Hmm, maybe the molecular ion is M+. The 158 could be M+ with something else, like maybe Cl is present. Alternatively, it could be a fragment, but I'm not sure yet.

Moving on to the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H groups, like from alcohols or carboxylic acids. A carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300, but the broadness here is from 3500 to 2700, which is a bit lower. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde's O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Or maybe it's an alcohol. Or perhaps a carbonyl group with a conjugated O-H? Or maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The peak at 1720 is a bit lower than a ketone or aldehyde, which are usually higher. Like, carboxylic acids have C=O around 1700, but maybe with some conjugation it could be a bit higher or lower. Alternatively, an ester or acid chloride? Wait, acid chlorides have higher C=O, around 1800 or so, so 1720 might not fit. Wait, the options include benzoic acids, so maybe the 1720 is a carboxylic acid. But wait, why is the peak sharp? Carboxylic acids usually have a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. Hmm, maybe it's an ester. Esters have C=O around 1720-1750, so that fits. Or maybe
