Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shifting of a sigma bond with the movement of pi bonds. They're pericyclic reactions, which usually involve concerted mechanisms. The question has three parts, each involving a different reaction. I'll need to tackle each one step by step.

First, let's look at the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat to form A. Wait, what's the structure of 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine? It's (CH3O)2CHNH2, right? Or wait, maybe it's more accurately drawn as (CH2OCH3)2NH. So it's a molecule where the amine is attached to a carbon that's connected to two methoxy groups. 

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. So when these react under acidic conditions and heat, I'm thinking it might be a Cope or Claisen rearrangement. Wait, but wait, Cope is for 1,5-dienes, but Claisen is for enol ethers. Alternatively, maybe it's an example of an aza-Cope rearrangement, since there's an amine involved. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of a sigmatropic shift where a proton is abstracted and the sigma bond moves.

Wait, in the presence of acid, the but-3-en-2-ol might form an oxonium ion or an enol. Alternatively, maybe the amine acts as a base? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of a Cope rearrangement, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement where an enol ether rearranges.

Wait, another thought: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups and an amine on the same carbon. Under acidic conditions, maybe it forms an iminium ion. Oh, wait, when amines are treated with acid, they form iminium ions. So perhaps the structure becomes a better leaving group or allows for some rearrangement.

Wait, but I'm trying to think of the possible products. The options for A are either 6-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-amine or (Z)-1-(but-2-en-2-yloxy)ethen-1-amine. The second option looks like an enamine or something with a conjugated system.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is CH2(OCH3)2NH2. But under acid, maybe it loses a methanol molecule or something. Alternatively, perhaps the structure can form an enamine. Because when amines react with ketones or aldehydes, they form enamines. But wait, but-3-en-2-ol is an alcohol. Hmm.

Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH2OH with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2. No, wait, the structure is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the OH is on C2. Wait, no: but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, but but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2OH. Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no: the formula for but-3-en-2-ol is HOCH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no, but but-3
