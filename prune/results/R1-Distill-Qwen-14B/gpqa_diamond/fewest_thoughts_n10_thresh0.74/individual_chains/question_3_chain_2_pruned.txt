Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the expectation value of an operator. The particle is a spin-half, so I remember that the spin states are usually described using the Pauli matrices. The state given is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the operators involved are 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices for z and x directions respectively.

First, I need to recall what expectation value means. The expectation value of an operator is the average value we'd expect to measure over many identical systems. For an observable represented by an operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

So, the operator here is 10σz +5σx. Let me break this down. I can compute the expectation value of each term separately and then add them together. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

Alright, so I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write that as a column vector. The standard basis for spin-½ particles has |↑⟩ as (1, 0) and |↓⟩ as (0,1). So,

|ψ⟩ = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Wait, because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so the components are 0.5 and 0.866.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix, which is [[1, 0], [0, -1]]. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩.

Let me compute this. So,

⟨ψ| is the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩. Since the components are real here, it's just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So, multiplying from the left by ⟨ψ| and on the right by σz |ψ⟩.

Wait, maybe there's a simpler way. The eigenstates of σz are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So when the state is expressed in the σz basis, the expectation value is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

Right, so the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. The probabilities are the square of the absolute values of these coefficients.

So, probability of |↑⟩: (0.5)^2 = 0.25
Probability of |↓⟩: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75

So, ⟨σz⟩ = (0.2
