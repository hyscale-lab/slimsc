Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a shot.

The question starts with (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. The (R) configuration suggests it's the enantiomer of the other form. Limonene is a common terpene found in citrus peels, like in oranges.

The first reaction is with a methanol solution of limonene, stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. Pd/C is a catalyst used in hydrogenation reactions. So, I think this is a hydrogenation of the double bonds in limonene. Limonene has two double bonds, right? One is a cyclohexene ring and another is a substituent, maybe an isopropyl group attached.

Wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene, more specifically a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Let me think: it's a bicyclic compound where the bicyclic system is a norbornene structure. So, norbornene has a bridged bicyclic structure with two rings.

When you hydrogenate norbornene, the double bond would open up. Pd/C under hydrogen would add H2 across the double bond. So, the structure would change from having a double bond to being a single bond with hydrogen added.

Wait, but the problem says that after consuming 1 equivalent of hydrogen, product 1 is isolated as the major product. So, since each double bond would require two equivalents of H2 for full hydrogenation, but here only one equivalent is consumed, perhaps only one of the double bonds is hydrogenated.

Wait, wait. Limonene has two rings, but I'm not sure. Let me try to recall. Limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, specifically it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene structure. So, the structure has two rings, but only one double bond. Or wait, no. I think limonene has one double bond. So, perhaps the structure is a bicyclo system with a double bond.

Wait, let me get that straight. Limonene, (R)-(+)-limonene, is a cyclic monoterpene with the structure bicyclo[2.2.1
