Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a multiple-choice question with two separate reactions, and I need to pick the correct major products from the options given. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and then H+. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanisms, but I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is a strong baseâ€”it's potassium hydride, right? So, in such conditions, maybe an elimination reaction is happening. Wait, the starting material is a spiro compound with a vinyl group. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol.

So, the molecule has a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon that's part of a spiro system. When you deprotonate an alcohol with a strong base like KH, you get an alkoxide. But why would that lead to a reaction? Maybe elimination, like an E2 mechanism. But wait, elimination would require a beta hydrogen. The structure is 1-vinyl, so the vinyl group is on the same carbon as the OH. Let me visualize it.

The spiro structure has two rings: one is a 3-membered and the other a 5-membered? Or wait, no, spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Wait, the spiro notation: the numbers are the bridgeheads. So the first part is a 3-membered ring (like cyclopropane) and the second a 5-membered. The non indicates 9 carbons total, but spiro compounds share one carbon. So the structure is a bit complex, but the main point is that the OH is on a bridgehead.

When you deprotonate this, you might form an alkoxide, which could lead to elimination. But with a strong base like KH, perhaps it's deprotonating the alcohol to form an alkoxide, which then might undergo some kind of cyclization or elimination.

Wait, I think in some cases, especially with spiro alcohols, treatment with a strong base can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. Because when the OH is removed as an oxide, it can't stabilize the adjacent carbocation if there's
