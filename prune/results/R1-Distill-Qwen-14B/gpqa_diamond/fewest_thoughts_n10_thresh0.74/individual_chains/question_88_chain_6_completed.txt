Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments involving GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, I need to figure out which process is happening based on the observations.

Let me read the question again. So, they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because stomach acid is pretty harsh. The rest got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Wait, Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. They're known to be sites where antigens are sampled, especially for oral vaccines. So, the GFP-tagged proteins probably got taken up by these patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genesâ€”oh, that rings a bell. I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo certain processes that increase diversity. Somatic hypermutation comes to mind. That's when mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptors, right? This happens after the initial immune response, allowing for fine-tuning of the antibodies.

Other options: complement activation is about the classical pathway, maybe leading to opsonization or lysis. But how does that relate to variability in heavy chains? Doesn't seem directly connected.

Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase variability in the antigen-binding site. It's more about the type of isotype.

VDJ recombination happens during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow. That's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined, creating the initial diversity. But in this case, the cells are in Peyer patches and are proliferating. Somatic hypermutation occurs after the initial diversification, especially in germinal centers, which are part of secondary lymphoid organs like the Peyer patches.

So the process here is probably somatic hypermutation. The high variability in the variable regions suggests that mutations have occurred to generate more diverse antibodies, which improves the immune response's specificity.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are observed to interact with the immune system, particularly at Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. After isolating the proliferating cell population from these patches, sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability. This variability is characteristic of a process that introduces mutations into the antigen-binding regions of B cell receptors to enhance immune specificity.

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process introduces mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors after the initial immune response, leading to increased diversity and improved antigen recognition. It occurs in germinal centers, which are present in secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
  
- **B) Complement activation**: This process involves the classical complement pathway, leading to antigen opsonization or lysis. It does not directly contribute to variability in the variable heavy chain genes, making this option unlikely.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the antigen-binding site. It is unrelated to the observed high variability.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This process generates initial diversity during B cell receptor formation in the bone marrow by joining V, D, and J segments. However, this occurs before the immune response and is not relevant to the observed variability in the Peyer patches.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs during the immune response to refine and optimize B cell receptor specificity. 

Answer: A
