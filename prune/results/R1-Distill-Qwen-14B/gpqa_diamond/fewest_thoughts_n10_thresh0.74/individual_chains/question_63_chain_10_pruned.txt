Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule transitioning between energy states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They give me the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency of vibration. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the model they mentioned is the quantum rotation-vibration model. Oh right, that combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. So the molecule's energy isn't just based on rotation or vibration alone, but both together.

The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state. But what exactly is the next state? I think in the quantum model, the energy levels are quantized. For the diatomic molecule, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational levels.

Wait, the question asks for the momentum of the absorbed photon. Momentum p of a photon is related to its energy. Because p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. So if I can find the energy difference between the states, I can find the momentum.

But first, what energy transition are we looking at? The molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental vibrational state is n=0 for vibration, but the rotational state is also considered. Oh wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized, but I'm not sure. Or wait, maybe the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor. No, the question says the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, but for the purposes of this problem, maybe the key is the vibrational energy transition.

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the current state is the ground state. The next state would be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. Which has a lower energy increase?

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model combine both. The energy is given by something like E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. The vibrational energy has a much larger spacing than rotational energy. So the transition with the smallest energy would be a vibrational transition, right? Or wait
