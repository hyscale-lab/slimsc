Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, interesting.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But here, the medium itself is moving. So does that affect the speed of the light as observed?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So normally, when a medium is moving, the speed of light in it depends on the relative motion between the medium and the observer. Oh right! This is probably related to the concept of relativity, or maybe it's about how velocities add in different reference frames.

Wait, but in classical mechanics, velocities just add up. So if the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light inside is moving at speed v_light relative to the glass, then from the lab frame, the speed of light would be v_light + v, right? But wait, that can't be right because the speed of light should always be c/n in the medium's frame. Or does it?

Wait, no, wait. The speed of light in the medium is v_light =
