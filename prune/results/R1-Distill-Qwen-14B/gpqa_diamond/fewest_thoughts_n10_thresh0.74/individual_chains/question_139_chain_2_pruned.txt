Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says that compounds A and B are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to choose the correct starting materials A and B from the options provided.

Hmm, wait, what reaction conditions are these? Oh, right! I remember that when alcohols are treated with nitrous acid (like from NaNO2 and HCl), it can lead to the formation of carbocations, especially in the case of alcohols. Oh wait, but more specifically, for secondary alcohols, I think the reaction might form a carbocation, which could then rearrange. Or wait, maybe it's about the formation of ketones from alcohols. Oh wait, wait, I think I'm confusing this with something else.

Wait, another thought: sodium nitrite and HCl are used in the formation of nitrous acid, which can act as an oxidizing agent. But in the context of alcohols, maybe it's about oxidation. But wait, the products here are diketones, which are compounds with two ketone groups. So the starting materials must have had two alcohol groups or something that can form ketones upon treatment.

Wait, let's think again. The reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and water. Oh, wait, in acidic conditions, nitrous acid can cause the cleavage of certain functional groups. For example,
