Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about an annihilation process: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of type A⁺ and two of A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so its speed is much less than the speed of light, right? Because if it's moving slowly, maybe we can approximate using non-relativistic mechanics. But wait, I'm not sure yet because the problem gives m_A c² in MeV, which is a unit of energy. So perhaps relativistic equations are needed here.

Let me think. The process is annihilation, so the initial particles (proton and antiproton) are converting their mass into other particles. Let's consider conservation of energy and momentum here.

Wait, the proton and antiproton are each other's antiparticles, so when they annihilate, they produce energy. But in this case, they're producing four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has mass 300 MeV/c², so two of them would be 600 MeV, and the other two another 600. So total mass for four particles is 1200 MeV/c². But wait no, that's assuming each is 300, so 2A+ is 600 and 2A- is another 600, so total 1200.

But wait, the initial particles are a proton and antiproton. The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², same for the antiproton. So together, their rest mass is 2*938 = 1876 MeV. So the total energy available would be much higher than the rest mass of the products—wait, but wait, the products are 4 particles each of 300 MeV. So total rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So much less than the initial rest
