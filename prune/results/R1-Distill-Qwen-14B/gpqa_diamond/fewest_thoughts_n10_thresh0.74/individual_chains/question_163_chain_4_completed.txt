Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's probably a metal hydroxide that can react with an acid. Since the acid is monobasic and strong, like HCl or HNO3, which donate one H+ each and are strong acids. So the reaction is likely between the hydroxide and the acid to produce water and a salt.

First, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 is there in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be helpful here. Iron has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(1 +16) = 55.85 + 3*17=55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ approximately 0.000936 moles. Let me calculate it more accurately: 0.1 / 106.85 = 0.000936 mol.

Wait, so Fe(OH)3 is a solid here, and it's going to react with a strong acid. Let's write the reaction. Fe(OH)3 reacts with a monobasic acid, say HA, to form Fe^3+ and water. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Wait, no, wait. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so it will react with acid to produce Fe^3+ ions and water. Since it's a hydroxide, each Fe(OH)3 molecule has three OH- groups. So when it reacts with H+, each OH- will take one H+. So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

Yes, that makes sense. So for every mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+ ions.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. Which is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

Now, the acid is 0.1 M (molarity), so the volume (V) needed can be found by M = n/V → V = n/M.

So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³. That's very close, so maybe that's the volume part.

Wait, but wait. The initial volume is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume changes? Wait, no, the problem says to prepare the solution in 100 cm³ total volume. So perhaps I'm mixing up the volumes here.

Wait, no, the 100 cm³ is the total solution volume after adding the acid. So the volume of the acid we add plus the volume of the solvent (water) should make up 100 cm³. But wait, probably, the initial solution is 100 cm³, but I'm adding some acid (let's say V cm³) to it, so the total volume becomes 100 cm³. Wait, no, the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of the solution after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So the initial solution is probably just water, but when you add the acid, the total becomes 100 cm³. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, and we're adding the acid to it. So the acid's volume plus the solution's volume equals 100 cm³. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so the acid is added to water to make up 100 cm³. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum volume of the acid needed. So perhaps we should consider that the acid is being added to the Fe(OH)3 and water to make up 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid plus the volume of the water is 100 cm³. But maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps to make it 100 cm³ after adding the acid, so the acid's volume is V, and the rest is water, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's easier to proceed and see.

So, according to the calculation, I need about 28.08 cm³ of the acid. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which matches.

But wait, let me recheck the calculation because I might have made a mistake.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.845, each OH is 17.007, so 3*17.007=51.021. So total is 55.845 +51.021=106.866 g/mol.

Mass given is 0.1 g. Moles = 0.1 / 106.866 ≈ 0.0009358 mol. So 3 times that is 0.0028075 mol H+ needed.

Then, volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.0028075 / 0.1 = 0.028075 L = 28.075 cm³. Which is approximately 28.08 cm³, so option C is 28.05 cm³. Close enough, so that's the volume part.

Now, the pH part. After adding the acid, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions, and excess H+ if any, but perhaps not, because the acid is just enough to neutralize the hydroxide.

Wait, but wait. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but in this case, it's being dissolved with a strong acid. So the reaction would proceed to completion. So all the Fe(OH)3 will react, and the solution would have Fe^3+ ions and excess H+ only if the acid is in excess.

Wait, the problem says to find the minimum volume of acid needed. So that would be the stoichiometric amount, meaning exactly enough to react with Fe(OH)3, without any excess acid. So in that case, the solution would have Fe^3+ ions and the solution's pH would depend on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions in water.

Because the solution would be acidic due to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the pH of the solution is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions. Let me think about that.

Fe^3+ in water can hydrolyze as follows:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

Wait, no, more accurately, it's a stepwise hydrolysis. The first step is:

Fe^3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

But for simplicity, the main effect is the release of H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution is (moles of Fe^3+) divided by the total volume (100 cm³ = 0.1 L).

So moles of Fe^3+ is 0.0009358 mol.

Concentration = 0.0009358 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009358 M.

Now, Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis. The hydrolysis reaction can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ as a source of H+.

The hydrolysis can be represented as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

But the equilibrium will depend on the Ka of the hydrolysis. Wait, but I don't remember the exact Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps we can find it from known data.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the pH by considering the hydrolysis and using the concentration of Fe^3+.

Wait, another approach: The solution after reaction would consist of Fe^3+ ions and excess H+ only if there's excess acid. But if we've used the minimum amount of acid, which is exactly the stoichiometric amount, then there would be no excess H+ from the acid. So the solution's pH would be determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But wait, another thing to consider: when Fe(OH)3 reacts with the strong acid, the product is Fe^3+ and water. So the solution would contain Fe^3+ ions, and the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So let's model this hydrolysis. The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ 

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak acid (since its conjugate base is OH-), perhaps we can model this using the hydrolysis constant.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the hydrolysis producing H+.

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ 

Wait, but if Fe(OH)3 is a solid in the solution, the reaction would proceed until the solution's concentration of H+ is such that the solution is saturated with Fe(OH)3. Hmm, but in this case, we have dissolved Fe(OH)3, so perhaps it's more appropriate to consider the solution as containing Fe^3+ and OH- ions, but for pH, we focus on H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis can be considered as a stepwise process, with each step contributing to H+.

But I'm not sure of the exact Ka value. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a hydrolysis reaction.

The general approach for a metal ion hydrolysis is:

M^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ M(OH)3 + 3 H+

But let's consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ 

The equilibrium expression would be:

Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But wait, the Ka is very small, since Fe(OH)3 is a weak acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the pH using the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M. Each Fe^3+ can donate 3 H+ per molecule via hydrolysis. But for a 3+ ion, each can donate one H+ (since it's a weak acid), but I think the hydrolysis is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the hydrolysis as a series of steps, but maybe it's easier to use the formula for a weak acid's pH.

Wait, but Fe^3+ is a strong Lewis acid, so it will hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions. The hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+ can be found from its solubility in water. Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be estimated using the hydrolysis reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a solution of Fe^3+ where each Fe^3+ ion donates three H+ ions. But that might not be accurate because the hydrolysis is a stepwise process, but perhaps for simplicity, we can model it as:

The concentration of H+ is 3 * sqrt( (Kw / Kf) * C )

Wait, perhaps I should look up the K for Fe(OH)3. Alternatively, wait, the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Wait, but Ksp is for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water. But in this case, Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved by the acid, so perhaps that's not the way to go.

Wait, perhaps I can find the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

So the expression for K is:

K = [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak acid, perhaps we can consider that in solution, the concentration of Fe(OH)3 is very low, and we can ignore it. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Each Fe^3+ ion can produce 3 H+ ions, but that's probably an overestimation because the hydrolysis reactions are not complete. So perhaps the concentration of H+ can be found by considering the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

Let me make the assumption that the hydrolysis is as follows:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

Assuming that x is the concentration of H+ produced per Fe^3+.

So for each mole of Fe^3+ that reacts, it produces 3 moles of H+.

So [H+] = 3x.

But the concentration of Fe^3+ would be 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358 (since x is small compared to initial concentration).

So the expression for K is:

K = ( [Fe(OH)3] ) * (3x)^3 ) / (0.009358)

But I don't know the value of K. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+.

Wait, I remember that the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ is around 10^-33 or something, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a solution of a metal ion.

Wait, another approach: The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M. Let's consider the hydrolysis:

Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is K = Kw / Kf, where Kf is the formation constant of the complex [Fe(OH)]^2+. Wait, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid. Since Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3, which is a weak base.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But without knowing K, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH by considering that the solution is acidic, and the H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Another approach: Since the solution is 0.009358 M Fe^3+, and Fe^3+ is a strong enough acid that it hydrolyzes significantly, making the solution strongly acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the pH using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a weak acid:

[H+] = sqrt( (K * C) )

But I need the K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, I think the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+ is approximately 1.6 × 10^-38. Wait, I'm not certain, but let's proceed with that.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look it up. Alternatively, I remember that Fe(OH)3 has a Ksp of around 6 × 10^-37. Wait, but Ksp is for the dissolution:

Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- 

So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in our case, the solution after adding the acid is acidic, so OH- is low, but Fe^3+ is present.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the pH using the Ksp and the concentration of Fe^3+.

Wait, in the solution, [Fe^3+] is 0.009358 M. So using Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3,

6e-37 = 0.009358 * [OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = (6e-37) / 0.009358 → approx 6.41e-35 → [OH^-] = cube root(6.41e-35) ≈ 4e-12 M.

So pOH = -log(4e-12) ≈ 11.62 → pH = 14 - 11.62 = 2.38.

Wait, but that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, considering that the solution is acidic, the pH would be around 2.38. But looking at the options, option C has pH 2.04 and option B has pH 2.69, etc. Hmm, this doesn't exactly match any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. Let me think again. The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is actually about 6 × 10^-37. So let's recalculate.

[Fe^3+] = 0.009358 M.

So Ksp = 6e-37 = 0.009358 * [OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = 6e-37 / 0.009358 → approximately 6.41e-35 → [OH^-] = cube root(6.41e-35) ≈ 4.0e-12 M.

pOH = log(4e-12) → log(4) is 0.6, so log(4e-12) is 0.6 -12 = -11.4 → so pOH is 11.4, pH = 14 - 11.4 = 2.6.

Hmm, that's about pH 2.6, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value.

Wait, perhaps the correct Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 6 × 10^-37. Let me recalculate:

[OH^-]^3 = 6e-37 / 0.009358 ≈ 6.41e-35 → [OH^-] = (6.41e-35)^(1/3) = (6.41)^(1/3) * (1e-35)^(1/3) = approx 1.85 * 1e-11.666... → wait, wait, 1e-35 is (1e-11.666)^3, since 11.666 *3 = 35. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.85e-11.666.

Wait, 1e-11.666 is approximately 2.14e-12. So 1.85 * 2.14e-12 ≈ 4.0e-12 M. So pOH is -log(4e-12) ≈ 11.3979 ≈ 11.40 → pH = 2.60.

So pH would be about 2.60. Looking at the options, option B has pH 2.69, which is close. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the method to find pH isn't correct. Because, after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ ions and excess H+ from the acid. But wait, in the minimum case, the acid is exactly stoichiometric, so [H+] comes only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis and any autoionization of water, but Fe^3+ is a strong enough acid to make the solution quite acidic.

Wait, but perhaps the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and the excess H+ from the acid. But wait, if the acid is added exactly stoichiometrically, then the H+ from the acid is neutralized by the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So the solution's pH is determined solely by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but that's only if the acid is exactly the stoichiometric amount. So, in that case, the solution would have Fe^3+ and the pH is due to their hydrolysis.

So, going back to the Ksp approach.

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-37.

So [OH^-]^3 = 6e-37 / 0.009358 ≈ 6.41e-35 → [OH^-] ≈ cube root(6.41e-35) ≈ 4.0e-12 M.

So pOH = log(4e-12) ≈ 11.40 → pH = 2.60.

But looking at the options, option B is pH 2.69, which is close but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the Ksp value I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Another approach: Maybe I can consider the solution as a hydrolysis solution of Fe^3+.

The formula is:

pH = (pKa - (1/2) log C) 

But I'm not sure about the pKa. Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be found using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( K * C )

But again, without knowing K, it's hard.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the pH part. Let me think again.

Wait, another angle: After adding the minimum volume of acid, the solution is exactly neutralized, so no excess H+ from the acid. So the solution's H+ comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M. Now, for Fe^3+ ion, each can produce 3 H+ ions when hydrolyzed. But the actual concentration depends on the hydrolysis constant.

But perhaps I can model the hydrolysis as Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+. The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is considered constant, so the expression simplifies to K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+].

Wait, but if Fe(OH)3 is a solid, then its concentration doesn't appear in the expression, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

So, K = [H+]^3 / C, where C is the concentration of Fe^3+.

But I don't know K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find K from the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-37, which is the solubility product for Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

So, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in the hydrolysis reaction, [H+] and OH- are related by Kw: [H+][OH-] = 1e-14.

So, from Ksp, [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+]

→ [OH^-] = (Ksp / [Fe^3+])^(1/3)

But [H+] = Kw / [OH^-] = Kw / ( (Ksp/[Fe^3+])^(1/3) )

= (Kw)^(1) * ( [Fe^3+] / Ksp )^(1/3 )

So,

[H+] = Kw^(1) * ( [Fe^3+] / Ksp )^(1/3 )

Plugging in the numbers:

Kw = 1e-14,

[Fe^3+] = 0.009358 M,

Ksp = 6e-37.

So,

[H+] = (1e-14) * (0.009358 / 6e-37 )^(1/3 )

Let me calculate the term inside the cube root:

0.009358 / 6e-37 = 9.358e-3 / 6e-37 = approx 1.5597e+34.

Now, cube root of 1.5597e34 → cube root of 1e33 is 1e11, cube root of 1e36 is 1e12. So 1.5597e34 is about 1.5597e34 = (1.5597)^(1/3) * (1e34)^(1/3) → 1.5597^(1/3) ≈ 1.16, and (1e34)^(1/3) = 1e(34/3) ≈ 1e11.333 → 1e11.333 is about 2.15e11.

So cube root is approx 1.16 * 2.15e11 ≈ 2.5e11.

So,

[H+] = 1e-14 * 2.5e11 = 2.5e-3 M.

Then, pH = -log(2.5e-3) ≈ 2.6.

So pH is approximately 2.6.

Looking at the options, option B has pH 2.69 and option C has pH 2.04.

Wait, but my calculation gives pH around 2.6, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cube root calculation.

Wait, let me do the cube root more accurately.

0.009358 / 6e-37 = 9.358e-3 /6e-37 = approx 1.5596666666666666e34.

Calculating cube root:

Cube root of 1.55967e34.

Expressed as 1.55967e34 = (1.55967) * (1e34) → cube root is (1.55967)^(1/3) * (1e34)^(1/3).

1e34 = 1e10^(3.4) → Wait, 1e34 is (1e11.333...)^3, because 11.333 *3 =34.

So, cube root of 1e34 is 1e(34/3) = 1e11.333... ≈ 2.154e11.

Cube root of 1.55967 is approximately 1.16, as before.

So 1.16 * 2.154e11 ≈ 2.5e11.

So [H+] = 1e-14 * 2.5e11 ≈ 2.5e-3 → pH = -log(2.5e-3) ≈ 2.6.

Hmm, perhaps I should use a calculator to get a more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute [H+] more accurately.

[H+] = 1e-14 * (0.009358 / 6e-37)^(1/3) → Let me compute the term inside the cube root:

0.009358 / 6e-37 = (9.358e-3) / (6e-37) = (9.358 /6) * 1e34 → 1.5596666666666666 * 1e34.

Now, cube root of 1.5596666666666666e34.

But perhaps a better approach is to take natural logs.

Let me compute ln(1.5596666666666666e34) = ln(1.5596666666666666) + ln(1e34).

ln(1.5596666666666666) ≈ 0.444.

ln(1e34) = 34 * ln(10) ≈ 34 * 2.302585093 ≈ 78.2879.

So ln(total) ≈ 0.444 +78.2879 ≈78.7319.

Divide by 3: 78.7319 /3 ≈26.243967.

So exp(26.243967) is e^26.243967 ≈ ?

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator for the cube root.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

So [H+] ≈ 2.5e-3 → pH ≈2.6.

Looking back at the options, option B is pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³. But earlier, the volume calculation gave me 28.08 cm³, which is option C's volume. But option C's pH is 2.04, which is much lower than my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial volume calculation. Let me recheck.

The moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

Reaction: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009358 ≈0.0028075 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.0028075 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028075 L = 28.075 cm³.

So that's about 28.08 cm³, which is option C's volume (28.05 cm³). But option C's pH is 2.04, which is lower than my calculation of 2.6.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the pH is lower because more H+ is produced from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: I can calculate the concentration of Fe^3+ and then find the pH using the hydrolysis reaction.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

Assuming that x is the concentration of H+ produced.

At equilibrium:

[Fe^3+] = 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358 (since x is small)

[H+] = 3x.

The expression for K would be:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] → but since Fe(OH)3 is a weak acid, perhaps K is very small, leading to a low x. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find the hydrolysis constant K for Fe^3+.

Wait, I found that the K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is approximately 5.61 × 10^-36. Let me proceed with that.

So K = (3x)^3 * [Fe(OH)3] / [Fe^3+]

But if Fe(OH)3 is a solid, its concentration is constant, so [Fe(OH)3] is a constant and can be ignored in the expression, leading to K = (3x)^3 / [Fe^3+] = (27 x^3) / (0.009358).

So 5.61e-36 = (27 x^3) / 0.009358 → x^3 = (5.61e-36 * 0.009358) / 27 → x^3 ≈ (5.61e-36 * 9.358e-3) /27 → (5.61e-36 *9.358e-3)= approx 5.24e-38 → divided by 27: ~1.94e-39 → x^3=1.94e-39 → x≈ cube root(1.94e-39) ≈ 5.8e-13.

So [H+] = 3x ≈ 1.74e-12 M → pH = -log(1.74e-12) ≈ 11.76 → which can't be right because the solution is acidic, not basic. Wait, perhaps the K I used is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the K for the hydrolysis is K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+], ignoring Fe(OH)3.

If K is 5.61e-36, then:

5.61e-36 = [H+]^3 / 0.009358 → [H+]^3 = 5.61e-36 *0.009358 ≈5.24e-38 → [H+] = cube root(5.24e-38) → approx 3.75e-13 → pH = -log(3.75e-13) ≈ 12.43 → again, this gives pH around 12, which is basic, which can't be right because the solution should be acidic.

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps I'm using the wrong K. Maybe the K should be much larger, leading to a lower pH.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Fe^3+ is a weak acid and find the pH using the formula for a weak acid.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe(OH)3 in the solution, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: Use the relation between the hydrolysis and the pH.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Assuming that the hydrolysis is the main source of H+, then:

[H+] = 3√(K * C)

But I need the correct K.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the solution is 0.009358 M Fe^3+ and calculate the pH using the hydrolysis equation.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ by considering the following steps:

1. Write the hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

2. Assume that the hydrolysis produces x moles of H+ per liter.

3. So [H+] = 3x, [Fe^3+] = 0.009358 - x ≈ 0.009358 (since x is small).

4. The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But without knowing K, this is difficult. Alternatively, perhaps I can find K from the solubility product of Fe(OH)3.

The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-37, which is for the reaction Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

The K for the hydrolysis is K = [H+]^3 [Fe(OH)3] / [Fe^3+].

But since [Fe(OH)3] is a solid, it's constant, so K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Wait, but how does this relate to Ksp?

We can write two reactions:

1. Fe(OH)3(s) ⇌ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- ; Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

2. Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ ; K_hyd = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Multiplying reaction 1 by -1 gives: Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- ⇌ Fe(OH)3(s) ; K = 1/Ksp.

Then, adding reaction 2 and this, we get:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O + Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ + Fe(OH)3(s) → simplifying? Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

Alternatively, combining reaction 1 and 2.

Wait, perhaps Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

And K_hyd = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Multiplying these gives Ksp * K_hyd = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 * [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] ] = [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3.

But [OH^-][H+] = Kw → [OH^-]^3 [H+]^3 = (Kw)^3.

So Ksp * K_hyd = (Kw)^3 → K_hyd = (Kw)^3 / Ksp.

So, K_hyd = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-37 = (1e-42) / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = approx 1.6667e-6.

So K_hyd = 1.6667e-6.

Now, using this K_hyd in the hydrolysis equation:

K_hyd = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] → 1.6667e-6 = [H+]^3 / 0.009358 → [H+]^3 = 1.6667e-6 * 0.009358 → ≈1.5597e-8 → [H+] = cube root(1.5597e-8) ≈ 2.5e-3 M → pH = -log(2.5e-3) ≈ 2.6.

So, pH is approximately 2.6, which matches our earlier calculation.

Looking back at the options, option B is pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³. But our volume calculation was around 28.08 cm³, which is option C's volume. But option C's pH is 2.04, which doesn't match our calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation.

Wait, the question says "the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution".

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the acid is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are needed.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

Moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.0009358 ≈0.0028075 mol.

Molarity of acid is 0.1 M, so volume = 0.0028075 / 0.1 = 0.028075 L → 28.075 cm³.

So the volume is approximately 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's volume of 28.05 cm³.

But option C's pH is 2.04, which is much lower than our calculated 2.6.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the pH is lower because the solution contains Fe^3+ and some excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but in the minimum case, the acid is exactly stoichiometric, so no excess H+ from the acid. So the pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the pH is lower because the concentration of Fe^3+ is higher than I thought. Wait, no, the concentration is 0.009358 M.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_hyd calculation. Let's re-calculate K_hyd.

K_hyd = (Kw)^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-37 → 1e-42 / 6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = approx 1.6667e-6.

Yes, that's correct.

So, [H+]^3 = K_hyd * [Fe^3+] → [H+] = cube root(K_hyd * C) → cube root(1.6667e-6 * 0.009358) → cube_root(1.5597e-8) → approximately 2.5e-3 → pH 2.6.

So, the pH should be around 2.6.

Looking at the options again, the only option that has a volume around 28 cm³ is option C, but its pH is much lower. Option B has a volume of 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check.

Wait, the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation for the volume. 0.0028075 mol H+ needed, 0.1 M acid → volume = 28.075 cm³. So option C's volume is 28.05 cm³, which is very close.

But according to the pH calculation, the pH is around 2.6, which is not present in the options. The closest option is B, which has pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³. But volume 30 would require more acid than the minimum needed.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation of the pH. Let me think again.

Wait, in the hydrolysis reaction, perhaps the [H+] is higher because the solution is more concentrated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution after reaction has a certain amount of Fe^3+ and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the concentration of H+ using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( (K * C) )

But wait, that's for a monoprotic weak acid. For Fe^3+ hydrolysis, each Fe^3+ releases 3 H+, so perhaps it's a 3rd order reaction.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

[H+] = (K * C)^(1/3)

But with K_hyd = 1.6667e-6, and C=0.009358 M,

[H+] = (1.6667e-6 * 0.009358)^(1/3) = (1.5597e-8)^(1/3) ≈ 2.5e-3 → pH=2.6.

But again, none of the options exactly match this.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the solution's pH is determined solely by Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But perhaps some H+ remains from the acid.

Wait, but in the minimum case, the acid is exactly stoichiometric, so all H+ is neutralized. No excess H+.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and the autoionization of water. But that's negligible.

Wait, perhaps the correct pH is around 2.6, but the options don't have it. The closest is option B (2.69) and option C (2.04). Since option C's volume matches our calculation, perhaps the intended answer is option C, and the pH is 2.04.

But why the discrepancy in pH?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the K_hyd calculation. Let me re-calculate K_hyd.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6e-37.

K for the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is K_hyd = (Kw)^3 / Ksp → (1e-14)^3 /6e-37 = 1e-42 /6e-37 = (1/6) * 1e-5 = approx 1.6667e-6.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial assumption that the solution's pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Maybe the solution is more acidic because the acid is in excess.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum volume, which is the exact amount needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, so there is no excess acid. Hence, the pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps in the solution, the Fe^3+ is hydrolyzing to produce H+ ions, and the concentration of H+ is sufficient to lower the pH below 3.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Option C: pH 2.04, volume 28.05 cm³.

If the pH is 2.04, then [H+] is about 9.12e-3 M.

Let me see if that makes sense with the earlier calculations.

If [H+] is 9.12e-3 M, then from the hydrolysis:

K_hyd = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] → (9.12e-3)^3 / 0.009358 → (7.56e-7) / 0.009358 ≈8.1e-5 → which would mean K_hyd ≈8.1e-5.

But earlier, we calculated K_hyd as 1.6667e-6, which is much smaller. So this would not make sense. Hence, pH 2.04 would require a higher K_hyd, which doesn't align with our earlier calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Based on the calculations, the volume is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C, but the pH doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option C, and the pH is 2.04, but I'm not seeing why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the initial assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the reaction uses a different stoichiometry. What if the acid is H3PO4 or another triprotic acid? No, the problem states it's a monobasic acid, so only one H+ per molecule.

Another idea: Perhaps the Fe(OH)3 has a molar mass I miscalculated.

Wait, Fe is 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.

Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) =55.85 + 3*17 =55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. Correct.

So 0.1 g is 0.0009358 mol.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in acid, the resulting solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but in the case of the minimum volume, which is exactly the stoichiometric amount, there's no excess H+. So, the pH is solely due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis, which I calculated as pH ~2.6.

But none of the options have this value. The closest is option B: pH 2.69, but the volume doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is higher because there's more Fe^3+ in solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp calculation. Let me double-check.

Another approach: Maybe the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But if the acid is added exactly the stoichiometric amount, there's no excess. So pH is from Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the Ksp value. Let me look up the correct Ksp for Fe(OH)3.

Upon checking, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is indeed about 6 × 10^-37.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I calculated the pH. Let me try an alternative approach.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M. The solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis reaction of Fe^3+.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Assuming that [Fe(OH)3] is a solid, K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

So, [H+] = cube_root(K * [Fe^3+]).

But I need the correct K for this reaction.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the pH using the formula for a solution of a weak acid. Since Fe^3+ is a weak acid, perhaps the pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak acid's dissociation.

The formula is:

pH = ½ (pKa - log C)

Where pKa is the acid dissociation constant. But for Fe^3+, the first dissociation can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+ 

The K for this reaction is K1 = [Fe(OH)^2+][H+] / [Fe^3+].

But I don't have the exact value of K1, which makes it difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid. Wait, but Fe^3+ is itself the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the initial calculations, the correct answer should be option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.6, which is not exactly matching any option. But the closest option for pH is B (2.69), but the volume doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that Ksp relates directly. Let me think again.

Another approach: The solution after reaction contains Fe^3+ and the pH depends on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.009358 M.

The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = (pKa + log C) / 2

But I don't have pKa for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be found using the relation:

pH = ½ (pKa + log (C))

But without knowing pKa, I'm stuck.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed to select the option that has the correct volume, which is option C (volume 28.05 cm³), even though the pH doesn't match my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the pH calculation, and the correct pH is indeed 2.04.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction between Fe(OH)₃ and the strong monobasic acid is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3 \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3(16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.0009358 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the moles of H⁺ required
From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of H⁺ are required for each mole of Fe(OH)₃. Thus:
\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.0009358 \approx 0.0028075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M acid needed
The volume of acid required is given by:
\[
V = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Molarity of acid}} = \frac{0.0028075}{0.1} = 0.028075 \, \text{L} = 28.075 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]
This matches closely with the volume of 28.05 cm³ in **Option C**.

### Step 4: Determine the pH of the resulting solution
After the reaction, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe³⁺:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3 \text{H}^+.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe}^{3+}}{\text{Volume of solution}} = \frac{0.0009358}{0.1} = 0.009358 \, \text{M}.
\]
Using the solubility product constant (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃:
\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3.
\]
For Fe(OH)₃, \(K_{sp} \approx 6 \times 10^{-37}\). Solving for \([\text{OH}^-]\):
\[
[\text{OH}^-]^3 = \frac{K_{sp}}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]} = \frac{6 \times 10^{-37}}{0.009358} \approx 6.41 \times 10^{-35}.
\]
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = (6.41 \times 10^{-35})^{1/3} \approx 4.0 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(4.0 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 11.40.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 11.40 = 2.60.
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated pH of 2.60 is closest to the pH of 2.69 in **Option B**, but the volume of 28.05 cm³ matches **Option C**. Since the question asks for the minimum volume, **Option C** is the correct choice, even though the pH does not perfectly align with the calculation.

Answer: C
