Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but I'll think it through.

So, the setup is that they're tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP. Then they're giving these to mice orally via gavage. Wait, I remember that rotavirus is a gastrointestinal pathogen, so oral delivery makes sense because that's how it enters the body normally.

The next part says that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Stomach acid is really acidic, so maybe the GFP got broken down or the proteins denatured. But some made it through and got entangled in intestinal mucus. Oh, right, the intestinal tract has mucus which can trap things. But they managed to reach the secondary lymphoid organs. Oh, secondary lymphoid organs are like Peyer's patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, etc. So the GFP must have gotten to these places.

They identified fluorescent Peyer patches. Peyer's patches are sites in the small intestine where a lot of immune responses happen, especially for things entering through the gut. So the tagged proteins must have made their way there.

Then they isolated the proliferating cell population from these patches. Proliferating cells are probably B cells that are activated and dividing. They sequenced their variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. High variability in variable regions suggests that some diversification has happened.

The question is asking which process is taking place. The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let me recall what each process does.

VDJ recombination is during B cell development, in the bone marrow. It's when the V, D, and J segments are joined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. This happens during the formation of the B cell receptor, so it's a process that happens early, in the bone marrow, and it creates the initial diversity. So if this were the case, you would see a variety of B cells, but I think it's more about the initial diversity rather than ongoing changes.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cells have been activated. It's a process where the variable regions are slightly mutated, increasing the diversity and affinity of the antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like Peyer's patches. So when B cells are proliferating there, this process would cause the variable regions to change, leading to high variability in the sequences.

Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG, etc.). This process involves recombination of the heavy chain's constant region. The variable regions aren't affected, so sequencing the variable regions wouldn't show much change here. So probably not C.

Complement activation is more about the activation of the complement system, which leads to lysis of pathogens or opsonization. I don't think this directly affects the B cell's variable regions. So B is probably not the answer.

Putting it together: The GFP-labeled proteins are entering the gut, some get through to the Peyer's patches. The B cells there are proliferating, and their variable heavy chains are showing high variability. This suggests that they're undergoing a process that creates variability in the B cell receptors, which is somatic hypermutation. Because this process occurs in the germinal centers, which are part of the secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. So the right answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins navigate through the intestinal mucus and reach secondary lymphoid organs, such as Peyer's patches. Fluorescent Peyer's patches are identified, and the proliferating cell population is isolated. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells reveals high variability, suggesting a process that diversifies the B cell receptors.

Analyzing the options:

- **VDJ recombination (D)** occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, generating initial diversity in the variable regions of the heavy chain. However, this process does not explain the observed high variability in the Peyer's patches, as it occurs earlier in B cell development.

- **Complement activation (B)** involves the complement system targeting pathogens for lysis or opsonization. This process does not directly affect the variable regions of B cell receptors and is unrelated to the observed variability.

- **Class switching recombination (C)** changes the class of antibody produced by B cells (e.g., from IgM to IgG). While this alters the constant region of the heavy chain, it does not affect the variable regions, so it cannot explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.

- **Somatic hypermutation (A)** occurs in germinal centers, such as those within Peyer's patches, where activated B cells undergo iterative mutations in their variable regions. This process increases diversity and affinity of the B cell receptors, consistent with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences.

Given the context of the experiment and the observed results, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
