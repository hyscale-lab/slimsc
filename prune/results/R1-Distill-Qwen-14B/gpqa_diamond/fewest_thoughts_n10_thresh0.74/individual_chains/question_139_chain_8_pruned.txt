Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite (HNO2) are commonly used in certain reactions, maybe like diazotization or something else. Wait, when you have an alcohol treated with nitrous acid, I think it can lead to the formation of a carbocation, especially if it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol. Or maybe it's related to the Beckmann rearrangement? No, Beckmann is for amides turning into ketones, right?

Wait, another thought: if the starting material is an alcohol, especially a secondary one, treating it with HCl, NaNO2, and water could lead to the formation of a ketone. Oh wait! I think that's the Stephen reduction or something else... Or maybe it's the treatment that leads to cleavage. Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

Oh, right! When an alcohol is treated with nitrous acid (like HCl and NaNO2), it can lead to the formation of nitrous esters, but more importantly, I think that in certain conditions, like with a primary alcohol, this can lead to the formation of an aldehyde, but wait, the products here are diketones. So maybe the starting materials are not alcohols but something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the treatment is leading to the formation of ketones from some starting material. Oh, wait! I remember that when you have a geminal diol (like a 1,2-diol), treating it with acid can lead to the formation of a carbonyl group. Because the diol would lose water, leading to a carbonyl. Or wait, maybe it's the oxidation of a diol.

Wait, but the reagents here are HCl, NaNO2, and H2O. Oh! Oh, wait, I think this is a reaction where a cyclic hemiacetal or something is formed, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann degradation? No
