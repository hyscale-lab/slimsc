Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem, and I need to figure out the angular distance between the first two minima when the number of sides N is infinitely large. Hmm, let me think about what I remember about diffraction and apertures.

The problem says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all apothems are the same length a. Wait, what's an apothem? Oh right, the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of its sides. So if all apothems are the same, the polygon is regular.

The light is monochromatic, wavelength λ, coming along the z-axis and hitting the aperture vertically. So, this is a diffraction scenario. The far field region implies we're looking at the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern.

I remember that for a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles θ where the path difference between the top and bottom of the aperture is an odd multiple of λ/2. The first minimum is at θ = λ/(π a), but wait, that's the first dark ring for a circular aperture. But this problem isn't circular; it's a polygon with N sides, and N is approaching infinity. Oh, so as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a smooth circle.

Wait, but no, that can't be right because a circle has infinite sides, but in this case, the apothems are all a. Hmm. Wait, when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. Oh wait, no. Wait, for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius (the distance from center to a vertex). The radius R is equal to a / cos(π/N). As N becomes very large, π/N becomes very small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²/(2N²)). So R ≈ a (1 + (π²)/(2N²)), which for large N is approximately a. So the radius R approaches a as N becomes large. So the polygon becomes a circle of radius a. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture when N is large.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. So if N is infinite, the shape is a circle. But wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a
