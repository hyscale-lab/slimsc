Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis onto this aperture, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field region when N is infinitely large. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a pattern of bright and dark regions called interference maxima and minima. The shape of the aperture affects the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, I know the minima occur at angles determined by the condition a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer, like m=1,2,3..., and a is the radius. But this is for a circular case. Here, it's an N-sided polygon.

Wait, but the problem says N is infinitely large. Oh right, as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So in the limit of N→∞, the aperture becomes a perfect circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'. Because the apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which for a polygon with many sides is almost the radius of the circumscribed circle.

So, if the shape is a circle, the diffraction pattern we're dealing with is the familiar single-slit diffraction pattern, but wait, no, wait—no, wait, the single-slit is a slit of width 'd', but here it's a circle. Oh wait, no, the single-slit diffraction pattern applies to a slit, but a circular aperture gives a different pattern, like the Airy disk. But the question is about the minima in the far field, which for a single slit is different from a circular aperture.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For a single-slit, the minima occur at θ where a sinθ = mλ, with m being ±1, ±2, etc. The first minima are at θ = λ/(a). But for a circular aperture, the minima are given by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum occurs at θ where the Bessel function J_1 reaches zero. I think that happens at around θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. Wait, but that's the first minimum in the diffraction pattern for
