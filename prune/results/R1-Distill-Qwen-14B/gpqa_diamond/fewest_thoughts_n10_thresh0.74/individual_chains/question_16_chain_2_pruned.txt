Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of optical activity. But let's take it step by step. The question asks how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. There are seven compounds listed, and I need to go through each one to determine if they're chiral and therefore optically active.

Alright, let's start by recalling what makes a compound optically active. I remember that a compound is chiral if it has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it can have another form of asymmetry, like an axial chirality, such as in allenes or certain rings. But most of the time, it's about chiral centers.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm. The structure here is a double bond. Since the double bond is at position 1, the molecule is but-1-ene. The substituents on each end of the double bond are Cl and CH2CH3 (from the 2-methyl group), right? Wait, the structure is actually 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So the structure is ClCH2
