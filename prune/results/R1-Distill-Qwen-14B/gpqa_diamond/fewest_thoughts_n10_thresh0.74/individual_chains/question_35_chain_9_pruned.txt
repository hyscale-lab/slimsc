Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, a muon is a lepton, similar to an electron, but I don't think that's too relevant here. The problem gives me a matrix representation of the operator Ay and asks about its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Alright, let me read the problem again. So, Ay is equal to c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, but wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are usually denoted by σx, σy, σz. Oh right, σy is actually the same as this S matrix. Because σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by some factors?

No, wait, the Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is exactly S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. So Ay is c multiplied by this Pauli Y matrix.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin matrices are usually represented as (ħ/2)σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. Because the spin angular momentum S is (ħ/2)σ. So for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

Let me think. So the intrinsic angular momentum operator A is probably the spin operator here, so Ay would be (ħ/2)σy. But wait, the problem says Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π), and S is this matrix. Let me compute that.

c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. But S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So let me compute the value of c multiplied by each element.

But wait, wait a second. Planck's constant h is related to ħ by h = 2πħ. So ħ = h/(2π). Let me compute c in terms of ħ.

c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). Oh, that's right. So c is ħ/2. So, Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. So Ay is exactly (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, which is the standard spin operator.

So, the eigenvalues of the spin operator σy are ±1 multiplied by (ħ/2), because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So for Ay, the eigenvalues a should be (ħ/2) * (±1) = ± ħ/2. But wait, let me compute that.

Wait, ħ is h/(2π). So ħ/2 is (h/(2π)) / 2 = h/(4π). Oh wait, so the eigenvalues of Ay are a = ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are plus and minus h/(4π). But wait, in the options, some of them talk about the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues.

Wait a minute, eigenvalues of spin components are real numbers, right? Because angular momentum operators have real eigenvalues when measuring in their respective directions. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be real numbers. But wait, wait, hold on. The matrix Ay is a 2x2 matrix, so it's a spin-½ system. The eigenvalues of Ay should be ± (ħ/2), but since ħ is h/(2π), that's ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts
