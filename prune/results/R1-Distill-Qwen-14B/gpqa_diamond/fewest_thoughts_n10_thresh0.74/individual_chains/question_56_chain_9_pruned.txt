Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom's states and transitions. Hmm, let me try to think this through. The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

So first, selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, I think the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Right, so the orbital angular momentum quantum number l changes by ±1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. Wait, but the transition is happening in two steps. So it's two dipole transitions, not a single one. Because from n=3 to n=1, that's a big jump, so maybe it goes through an intermediate state in between.

So the first transition would be from n=3 to some n=2 or n=1? But wait, since two transitions are needed, the first step must go from n=3 to n=2, and then n=2 to n=1. Because n can't decrease by more than 1 in a single dipole transition, I think.

Wait, no, wait. The selection rules for n are not as strict as for l and m. Oh right, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but for dipole transitions, the main thing is that the photon must have the right angular momentum. But wait, no, the selection rule for n in dipole transitions is Δn = 0, ±1, but for hydrogen, the transitions between n levels are allowed as long as l changes by ±1. So from n=3, l=0, to n=2, l must be 1 because l can go from 0 to 1 (Δl=+1) or maybe 1 to 0, but wait, the initial state is l=0. So the transition from l=0 can only go to l=1 or maybe l= something else? Wait no, for dipole transitions, the selection rule is Δl = ±1. So from l=0, the next possible
