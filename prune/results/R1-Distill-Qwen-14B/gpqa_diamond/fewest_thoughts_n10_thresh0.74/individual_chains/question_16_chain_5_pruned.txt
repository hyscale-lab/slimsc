Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter or some kind of asymmetric center. So I need to look at each compound and see if they have any chiral centers or if they have a plane of symmetry.

Let's go one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, that's an alkene with substituents. The configuration is Z, which refers to the geometry around the double bond. But for optical activity, I'm more interested in stereocenters. Let me draw the structure. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Cl is on C1, a methyl on C2. The other substituents: C1 has Cl, double bond, and two other substituents? Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C=CH-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH
