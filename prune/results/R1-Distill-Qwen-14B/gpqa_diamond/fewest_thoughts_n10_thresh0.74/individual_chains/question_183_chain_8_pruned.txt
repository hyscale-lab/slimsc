Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency in the product after a reaction. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting material. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's visualize that. So it's a cyclohexene ring, right? So cyclohexene has one double bond. The substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So 5-vinyl would mean the vinyl group is attached at position 5. And the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Or wait, the numbering... Let me think. The cyclohexene part is the base ring, and the substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond—so position 3 and 4 are double bonded. Then, at position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent.

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with double bond between C3 and C4. Positions 2 and 5 have substituents: at C2 is a formyl (CHO), and C5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's attached as CH2=CH- at position 5). Then, the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Wait, no—the name says cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at position 3. So the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4, and the COOH is attached at C3. Wait, no, wait—the 'cyclohex-3-ene' part means the double bond is between C3 and C4. The carboxylic acid is substituent on the ring. So perhaps
