Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, stability constants... I remember they have to do with how stable a complex is, right? The higher the stability constant, the more the complex tends to form.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants, β1 to β4, are provided as 9, 40, 63, and 16. Wait, why are there four β values? Oh, right, because there are four possible complexes, each with a different number of SCN- ligands attached.

The complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and [Co(SCN)_4]^3-? Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)]^n- where n changes. Wait, the charges would depend on the number of ligands and the oxidation state of Co. Co is +2, each SCN is -1. So for n ligands, the complex charge would be (2+) + (n*(-1)) = 2 - n. 

But wait, the actual names of the complexes and their colors matter here. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN ligands, so the complex [Co(SCN)_2] is the one in question. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the colors—maybe the blue is for a different one. Oh, but the problem states it's the blue dithiocyanato, so that's [Co(SCN)_2] for sure.

The goal is to find the percentage of this blue complex among all Co species. So I'll need to calculate the concentrations of all four complexes and find what fraction the [Co(SCN)_2] is.

Stability constants are given as β1 to β4. Wait, what do these βs correspond to? I think βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (since Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^0), β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^3-.

So the four complexes are:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+ (β1=9)
2. Co^2+ + 2 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2] (β2=40)
3. Co^2+ + 3 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_3]^- (β3=63)
4. Co^2+ + 4 SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_4]^3- (β4=16)

Wait, wait. Order of β's? Because β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63, β4 is 16. So β3 is the highest, followed by β2, then β1, and β4 is lower than β1. Interesting.

The problem is that Co^2
