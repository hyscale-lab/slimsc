Okay, so I've got this question about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the nucleus in question is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li has atomic number 3, right? So, Li usually has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So X is Li-6. So the molar mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). But wait, each u is about 1.66e-27 kg. I'll need that for calculations.

The problem is about finding the energy of the RHIC. The speed is given as 0.96c, so I think I need to calculate the relativistic energy of the nucleus. Relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's compute gamma first. v is 0.96c. So, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 which is 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 minus that is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So yeah, gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of the nucleus is needed. The nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass of 6 u. So m = 6 * 1.66e-27 kg. Let's compute that: 6 * 1.66 is 9.96e-27 kg. Hmm, wait, 1.66e-27 *6 is (1.66 *6)=9.96e-27 kg.

The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s, but when calculating E, since we'll be using gamma multiplied by m c², maybe I can compute it step by step.

So E = gamma * m * c².

Let me compute m c² first. m is 9.96e-27 kg. c squared is (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s². So m c² is 9.96e-27 * 9e16 = Let's calculate that.

9.96e-27 *9e16 = 8.964e-10 J. Wait, that's a very small number. But wait, energy in particle physics is usually expressed in GeV. So I need to convert Joules to GeV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, which is 1.602e-10 J.

So, 8.964e-10 J is equal to 8.964e-10 / 1.602e-10 GeV. Let me compute that: 8.964 / 1.602 ≈ 5.59 GeV. So m c² is about 5.59 GeV.

Then, multiplying by gamma which is about 3.5714, E = 5.59 * 3.5714 ≈ Let's calculate that. 5 *3.57 is 17.85, 0.59 *3.57 is about 2.1063. So total is approximately 19.956 GeV. Hmm, but wait, that's an approximate calculation.

But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the gamma calculation. Let me redo the gamma part.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 

Let me compute 0.96 squared again: 0.96 *0.96 = 0.9216.

So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. 

sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So gamma is approximately 3.57143.

Now, let's compute m c² more accurately.

m = 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 kg. Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values. Because 1 u is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 6 u is 6 * 1.66053906660e-27 = 9.9632344e-27 kg.

Then m c² is 9.9632344e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

(3e8)^2 is 9e16 m²/s².

So m c² =
