Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to identify an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are either Cis or Trans versions of propenyl acetate or butenyl acetate. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to recall what these compounds look like. Acetate esters have the structure R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. For propenyl, the R group would be CH2CHCH2, but wait, no, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Oh wait, wait. Let me get that right. Propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, propenyl has three carbons, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So, the acetate would be (CH2=CHCH2)OAc. Similarly, butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond.

Wait, so the options are between propenyl and butenyl. So, the structures would be:

Cis-propenyl acetate: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituents on either end (like the OAc group and the CH2) are on the same side.

Trans would have them opposite.

Similarly for butenyl, but with four carbons. Let me think about the NMR data given.

The 1H NMR has:

7.0 ppm: 1H, doublet, J=16 Hz.

5.5 ppm: 1H, doublet of quartets (dq).

2.1 ppm: 3H, singlet. That's likely the acetate methyl group, OAc-CH3.

1.6 ppm: 3H, doublet. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, so acetate is OAc- (with CH3COO-), so the ester group is OAc. The R group is connected to the oxygen. For propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that would be 1-propenyl acetate. Alternatively,
