Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Hmm, let's see. The options are Superstring Theory, Quantum Chromodynamics, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinities that pop up in calculations. So when a theory has these infinities, you need to regularize it, which means you find a way to make the calculations finite before taking the limit where the regularization is removed.

Now, which of these theories are quantum and which are classical? Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory, right? It's Maxwell's equations and all that without quantum mechanics. So maybe that's a clue.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I think QED has things like loop diagrams that can lead to divergences. So they must require regularization. Same with Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong interaction. QCD deals with things like quarks and gluons, and I remember that at high energies (or equivalently, short distances), QCD becomes asymptotically free. But even so, it's a quantum theory and probably has loop divergences, so it would need regularization.

Superstring Theory is a type of string theory, which is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. String theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences that QED and QCD have. Or wait, do they? I think in string theory, especially when you include all the necessary components like different string states and the right background, the theory doesn't require the same kind of divergent regularization because the calculations are inherently finite. Or maybe it's because string theories don't have the same loop divergences as point particle theories.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Why wouldn't string theory need regularization? Oh, right, because string theories calculate amplitudes using sums over all possible topologies of the strings, which in certain cases can lead to finite results without needing to introduce a cutoff. Or perhaps the infinities that would appear in loop integrals in QFT are somehow canceled out due to the extended nature of the strings, making the theory finite. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization.

So looking at the options, the question is which one never requires regularization. So D is Classical Electrodynamics—since it's a classical theory, do you even have divergences in the same way? Well, in classical theories, you can have issues like the infinite self-energy of a charge (like the electron), but I think those are handled differently than in quantum theories. But wait, does classical electrodynamics require regularization? Or is it just the quantum version that does?

Regularization techniques like introducing a charge screening or using a cutoff are more about handling infinities in quantum theories. Classical theories might have their own issues, but they aren't typically "regulated" in the same way. So maybe the correct answer is D) Classical Electrodynamics because it's a classical theory and doesn't need regularization in the same sense as quantum theories. Or wait, no, because the question is about which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. So let's think about each theory
