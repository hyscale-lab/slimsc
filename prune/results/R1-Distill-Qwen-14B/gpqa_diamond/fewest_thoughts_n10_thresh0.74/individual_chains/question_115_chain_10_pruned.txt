Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrons and positrons annihilating into photons. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis but in opposite directions. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, so first, I should probably recall what happens when a positron and electron annihilate. They typically produce gamma-ray photons. Since they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. But because they have different Lorentz factors, their energies and momenta aren't the same. Hmm, right, the positron has a lower Lorentz factor, so lower energy than the electron?

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time dilates and mass increases. So the electron has gamma=4, and the positron gamma=2. Since their rest masses are the same (electron and positron are each other's antiparticles), their energies are gamma * m_e * c².

So the total energy before annihilation would be the sum of their energies. Let me calculate that. The electron's energy E_e is gamma_e * m_e c² = 4 m_e c². The positron's energy E_p is gamma_p * m_e c² = 2 m_e c². So total energy E_total = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Now, when they annihilate into two photons, the total energy must be conserved, and so must the momentum. Since the initial system has some total momentum, the photons must carry off momentum in such a way that their vector sum equals the initial momentum.

Hmm, let's think about initial momentum. The electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (coming from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, since gamma is 4, maybe it's easier to use the relation that for a particle, E² = (pc)
