Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Right, that's from Einstein's theory of relativity. So the idea is that time moves slower for the moving object compared to a stationary observer.

The problem says that an astronaut from the Large Magellanic Cloud is traveling to Earth at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The spacecraft is moving at a constant speed, so this is a case of special relativity, not general relativity, which deals with acceleration and gravity. Right, so special relativity applies here.

The astronaut is 22 years old and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. Wait, wait, no—wait, the question says, "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth." So we're looking for the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, but I think I need to calculate the time from Earth's frame of reference first, and then apply the time dilation effect to find the astronaut's experienced time. Or is it the other way around?

Let me think. The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth—what's that? Oh, wait, the question doesn't give that. Hmm, that's a problem. Without knowing the distance, how can I compute the time?

Wait a second. Oh, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question might be expecting
