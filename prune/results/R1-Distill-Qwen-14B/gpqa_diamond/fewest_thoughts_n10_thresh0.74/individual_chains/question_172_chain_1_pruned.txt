Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm trying to remember what I learned about stellar atmospheres and excitation levels. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, I think.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy levels. The equation is (n_i)/(n_j) equals (g_i/g_j) times exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Right, so n_i is the number of particles in state i, and g is the statistical weight.

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that's interesting. So E = k * T * something.

The iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, so n_1/n_2 = 2. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So n_i for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1/n2 = 2.

Assuming LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which we are told holds. So for each star, the
