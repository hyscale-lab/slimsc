Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So a triplet means two neighboring protons, quartet means three neighboring.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. That makes me think of something like two equivalent CH3 groups next to a CH2. Because if you have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, each CH3 would be split by the two protons of the CH2. So each CH3 would be a triplet. Oh wait, but 6H would be three CH2 groups? No, wait, maybe it's two equivalent CH2 groups. Or wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted group. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane scenario. No, probably not. Another thought: if it's a triplet for 6H, maybe two sets of three H each? Or perhaps it's two CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2, which would split into a triplet. Because each CH3 is next to a CH2 (with 2 H), so the triplet would come from coupling with two neighboring Hs. So 2 CH3 groups, each with 3 H, so total 6 H. That makes sense.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet (which is split into four) comes from coupling with three neighboring H. So each H in that quartet has three neighboring H. So maybe a CH2 group next to a CH3. Or perhaps a CH connected to something else. Wait, 4H in a quartet. Oh, maybe it's two CH2 groups each coupled to something with three equivalent H. Wait, but 4H as a quartet. Alternatively, could it be a CH2CH2 group, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH3. Wait, let's think: if you have a CH2CH3 group, each H in the CH2 would be a quartet because they are next to a CH3
