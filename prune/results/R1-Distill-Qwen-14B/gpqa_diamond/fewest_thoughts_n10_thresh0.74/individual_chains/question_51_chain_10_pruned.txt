Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, and I'm supposed to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, electrons can move freely, so charges will redistribute based on the external charge.

Wait, when you have a grounded conducting sphere and place a charge near it, the sphere's induced charges will have a certain distribution. The sphere being conducting means the charges will reside on the surface. But since it's grounded, any excess charge from the sphere (if any) can go into the ground. But in this case, the sphere is neutral initially, right?

So when a charge q is placed near the sphere, it induces a charge on the sphere. The induced charge on the sphere's outer surface would be -q because the sphere is conducting and the charge on the conductor will be opposite to the external charge. But wait, noâ€”wait, the external charge is a point charge, and the sphere is neutral. The induced charges would be such that the inner surface has charge -q and the outer surface has +q, but wait, no, the sphere is grounded. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, when a conducting sphere is placed near a charge, the charges inside the conductor (the sphere) will redistribute. Since the sphere is neutral, the induced charge on the inner surface would be -q,
