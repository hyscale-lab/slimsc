Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two reactions, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products. The options are given as A and B for each, so I have to determine what happens in each reaction and then match them to the options.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A.

Second reaction: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacts with acetyl bromide in the presence of LDA (a base) to give product B.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction A:

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings joined by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure would have two cyclopropane-like rings? Wait, no, spiro compounds are when two rings are connected by a single atom. So in this case, the spiro is [3.5], meaning one ring has 3 carbons (probably cyclopropane) and the other has 5, making a spiro structure. The substituents are 1-vinyl and the alcohol is on the same carbon.

Wait, the compound is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the main structure is a spiro ring system, which is nonane (9 carbons). The numbering is a bit tricky, but the key is that there's a double bond at position 5. Also, the spiro position is at carbon 1, which has both the vinyl group and the hydroxyl group.

The reaction conditions are THF with KH and then H+. THF is a solvent, and KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base. But wait, when I think about reaction conditions, sometimes when you have a strong base like LDA, it's used to deprotonate things. But in this case, it's KH. Wait, but maybe it's more about the reaction type.

Wait, the first reaction is with THF, KH
