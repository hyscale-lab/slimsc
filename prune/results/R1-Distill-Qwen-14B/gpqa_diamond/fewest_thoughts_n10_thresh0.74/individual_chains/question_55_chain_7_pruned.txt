Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The NMR data is given as:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

So I need to figure out which structure this corresponds to. Let's start by recalling what these structures look like.

First, acetate esters have the structure R-OAc, where Ac is the acetyl group (O=C-O- attached to R). So in this case, the R groups are propenyl or butenyl, and the configuration is either cis or trans.

The options are:
A) Cis-butenyl acetate
B) Trans-propenyl acetate
C) Cis-propenyl acetate
D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Wait, but butenyl has four carbons, while propenyl has three. So butenyl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, butenyl is CH2CHCH2CH3 maybe, but with a double bond. So the structures would be something like CH2=CHCH2OAc for propenyl acetate, but waitâ€”no, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or maybe it's CH2CH2? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but in these esters, the double bond position matters.

Wait, but the structures vary based on where the double bond is. For propenyl, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), making it a propenyl group. But for butenyl, the double bond could be between 1-2 (butenyl) or 2-3 (butenyl). Wait, but the options are butenyl and propenyl, so the main chain is either three or four carbons.

But let's think about the NMR data. The key peaks
