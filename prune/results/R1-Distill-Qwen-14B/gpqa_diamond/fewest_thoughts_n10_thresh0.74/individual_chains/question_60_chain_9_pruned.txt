Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation happens. So the astronaut's own time would be different from the time observed from Earth. Let me think through this.

The question says the spacecraft is going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth. We need to find out how long it takes from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, the average lifetime is 150 solar years. Oh, but the astronaut is 22 now, and the trip time might be longer than that. Hmm, but maybe the spaceship's speed makes the trip short enough for the astronaut to survive.

I think I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut using the time dilation formula. Right, time dilation in special relativity is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

So v is 0.99999987c. Let me calculate that. First, compute v squared over c squared. (0.99999987)^2 is approximately (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Wait, let me compute 0.99999987 squared. 

0.99999987 is almost 1, so squaring it gives about 1 minus
