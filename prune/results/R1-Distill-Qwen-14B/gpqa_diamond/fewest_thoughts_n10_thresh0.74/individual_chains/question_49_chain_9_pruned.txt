Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic reactions involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond, right? The examples given are Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are both [3,3] sigmatropic shifts.

The problem has three parts, each with a reactant and some conditions (like H+ and heat), and I need to pick the correct products from the options. Let's take them one at a time.

Starting with the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A

Hmm, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw that structure. It's an ethanamine where both H's on the N are replaced by methoxy groups. So, structure is OMe2NCH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would have the amine group on carbon 1, and both substituents on that carbon are methoxy. So, the structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, no. Wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would mean both H's on the NH are replaced by OMe. So, HN(COCH3)2? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? No, wait, the amine is on carbon 1, so the structure is CH2CH2 group with the amine. Wait, perhaps it's (CH3O)2N-CH2CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. 1,1-dimethoxy would replace two H's on the NH2 with OMe groups. So, structure is (CH3O)2N-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that would be 1,1-dimethoxy-N-ethylamine? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3O)2NHCH2CH3? No, maybe the correct structure is (CH3O)2NCH2CH3. Alternatively, maybe it's more like OMe groups on the ethylamine's N.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think again. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine: the ethanamine is CH2CH2NH2. The '1' position is the N, so dimethoxy would be on the N. So, N has two methoxy groups and one ethyl group? No, wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So, 1,1-dimethoxy would replace two H's on the NH2. So, the structure would be (CH3O)2N-CH2CH3? But wait, that's three substituents on N. Oh wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-
