Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but isn't that just the same as the ejecta moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s from the Galaxy's frame? Because in inertial frames, velocities are relative but the speeds should be the same if it's moving directly towards, right? Or wait, maybe not. Hmm, no, actually, if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But in the ejecta's frame, it's stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, the velocity as observed from each frame is 60,000 km/s towards each other. But when we're calculating distance, I think I need to consider time and relative velocity.

Wait, the question is asking: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, time is different here because of special relativity, I think. Because if there's a significant relative velocity, time dilation comes into play. Oh right, because from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's clock would be running slower than the Galaxy's clock, or vice versa.

Wait, let me get this straight. In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But in the Galaxy's frame, the time elapsed would be longer, due to time dilation. Because the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy. So, the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time would be its speed multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

So the steps I should take are: calculate the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame, then multiply by the speed of the ejecta (60,000 km/s) to get the distance.
