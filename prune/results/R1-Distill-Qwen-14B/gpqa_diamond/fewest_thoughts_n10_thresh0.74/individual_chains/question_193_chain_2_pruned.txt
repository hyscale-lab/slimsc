Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it. The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relation involving parallax. Hmm.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Oh right, parallax plx is inversely related to distance. Because I remember that parallax (in parsecs) is 1 over distance. So plx = 1/r, where r is distance in parsecs. Or wait, parallax in arcseconds is equal to 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, meaning as r increases, plx decreases.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx = 1/r gives N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me compute that. (1/r)^5 is 1/r^5, so 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, I think that's about the differential change, like the number per unit distance.

Wait no, the question says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Hmm. Maybe I need to
