Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. It's about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². And the question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Wait, I remember that for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz. Oh wait no, in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, I think the 3D isotropic case is actually treated with the radial quantum number and the angular momentum. No, wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the total energy states, independent of the angular part because the potential is spherically symmetric.

Wait, the energy levels in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are given by E = (n + 3/2)ℏω, right? Where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers in each direction, like n = nx + ny + nz. Oh wait, but wait, no. Wait, each direction (x, y, z) contributes (n_i + 1/2)ℏω, so the total energy would be the sum. So E = (nx + ny + nz + 3/2)ℏω. So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers.

But wait, I think I'm getting confused. Oh, right, another approach: for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized as E = (n + 3/2)ℏω, where n is a non-negative integer, n = 0,1,2,... Each n corresponds to a certain degeneracy. Because in 3D, the number of states (eigenfunctions) for a given n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, or something like that. Wait, no, I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, in 3D, the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. But I think the correct formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ℏω. So the possible values of n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers. So for each energy level, the sum of these three quantum numbers is a certain value. Let me see: for the ground state, each quantum number is zero, so sum is 0, E = (0 + 3/2)ℏω = (3/2)ℏω. First excited state: the sum could be 1. So the energy would be (1 + 3/2)ℏω = (5/2)ℏω. Then the next would be sum=2, E=(7/2)ℏω, then sum=3, E= (9/2)ℏω, and so on.

Wait, the question is about the third excited state. So I need to figure out what the energy is when it's the third excited state. But wait, in 3D, how are the states ordered? The ground state is the lowest energy, then first excited, second, etc. So for the ground state (n=0), E=(3/2)ℏω. Then the first excited state has n=1, E=(5/2)ℏω. Second excited state, n=2, E=(7/2)ℏω. Third excited state, n=3, E=(9/2)ℏω. So the energy should be (9/2)ℏω. That matches option A and C.

Now the second part of the question: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue, i.e., the degeneracy. The degeneracy for each energy level in 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator depends on the value of n, where E = (n + 3/2)ℏω. The number of states (degeneracy) for a given n is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me think. For n=0, sum is 0, so the only state is 0,0,0. So degeneracy is 1. For n=1, the sum is 1, which can be (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three states, so (1+1)(1+2)/2 = 3, yes. For n=2, the sum is 2. The possible combinations are (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). That's 6 states. So (2+1)(2+2)/2 = 3*4/2=6, yes. For n=3, sum is 3. The possible combinations include things like (3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3), (2,1,0), (2,0,1), etc. How many? Let's calculate using the formula (n+1)(n+2)/2. For n=3, that's (4)(5)/2=10. So the degeneracy is 10. So for the third excited state, which corresponds to n=3 (since ground is n=0), the degeneracy is 10.

Looking back at the options, option A says (9/2)ℏω and 10. Option C says same energy but 3 eigenfunctions. So option A must be correct.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by \( E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial directions. The degeneracy of each energy level is determined by the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue, which is given by \( \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \).

To find the energy of the third excited state, we note that the ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right)\hbar\omega = \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the third excited state is calculated using the formula \( \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \). For \( n = 3 \), this gives:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing this with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2}\hbar\omega, 10 \)**.
