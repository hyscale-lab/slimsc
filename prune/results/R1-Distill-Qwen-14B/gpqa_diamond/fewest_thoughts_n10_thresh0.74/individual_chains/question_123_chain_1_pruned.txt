Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of ejecta. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see.

The question states that a supernova occurs, and part of the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which is good because that means we can apply special relativity principles here. 

Wait, so the ejecta's frame is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. But wait, because in the problem, it's the ejecta's frame where the Galaxy is moving towards it at that speed. Oh right, because in inertial frames, if one is moving at velocity v relative to the other, the other is moving at -v in the first's frame.

Wait no, in the problem, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame? Or is it the other way around? No, the question says, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s? Because relative velocities would be negative of each other. So I think in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about it. If frame E is the ejecta, and frame G is the Galaxy, then according to E, G is moving at +60,000 km/s towards E. So, from E's perspective, G is approaching at 60,000 km/s. In G's frame, the ejecta (E) is moving at -60,000 km/s (since velocity is relative).

Wait, no, the direction depends on the frame. Let's clarify the reference frames. Let me imagine that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center (which is the origin perhaps) at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta's velocity is v = 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy center.

But the problem says, from the
