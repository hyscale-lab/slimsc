Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The main difference is that synchrocyclotrons use a varying magnetic field, unlike the constant field in a regular cyclotron. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think. Oh right, because as the particles gain energy, their radius increases, so the magnetic field needs to adjust to keep them on the same orbit. Or wait, maybe the frequency changes? I'm getting a bit mixed up here.

The question says a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy at t=0, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0], with given U0 = 190 kV and Φ0 = π/4. The problem asks how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. The options are A to D.

So, first, I need to figure out the relationship between the potential, the kinetic energy, and the number of revolutions. I remember that in cyclotrons, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the gap between the D-shaped boxes. Each time they do that, they gain energy equal to the voltage applied.

Wait, the proton is accelerated twice, so maybe each full cycle (like passing through the gap twice?) contributes twice the voltage? Or perhaps each half
