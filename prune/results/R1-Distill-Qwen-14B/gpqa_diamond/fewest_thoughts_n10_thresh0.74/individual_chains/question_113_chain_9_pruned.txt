Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are various chemical formulas, so I need to match the data to one of them.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad. If it's an alcohol, the O-H stretch is usually a broad peak around 3300, but maybe carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H around 2500-3300. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH from something else, like a phenol or an alcohol.

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 peak is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak could correspond to conjugated carbonyls, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or something else.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has a double bond somewhere, possibly conjugated with the carbonyl group. That makes me think of something like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. Because vinyl protons usually show up around 5-6 ppm, but in the NMR, they'd have specific splitting depending on their environment.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm. So, what fragments have a mass of 45? Let's think. The molecular ion peak might not be given, but the fragment could be a common one. Looking at 45, it could be a CH3CO+ ion (acetate), which is 45. Or maybe something else. Acetate has a mass of 45 (12*2 +1*3 +16*2 = 24+3+32=59? Wait, no, wait, acetate is CH3COO-, which is molecular weight 60. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CO, but that's acetone, which is 58. Hmm, perhaps it's the fragment from a ketone. Wait, if the fragment is 45, perhaps it's something like (CH2)2O, but that's 44. Maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, another possibility is the acetyl group (CH3CO), which is 43, but maybe with an oxygen? Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a fragment like C3H7O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C
