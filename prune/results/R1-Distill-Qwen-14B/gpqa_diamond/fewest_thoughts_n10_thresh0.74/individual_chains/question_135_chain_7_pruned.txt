Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics and decay modes of a boson. Let me try to break it down.

The problem says that the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by this Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this is a Yukawa interaction, similar to how the Higgs field interacts with fermions. So the boson X is interacting with various fermions, probably giving them mass when it gets a vacuum expectation value (vev), but in this case, the v might be the vev, and X is the fluctuation around it.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means the decay products' masses must be less than the mass of X, right? Because energy and mass are related via E=mc², so for a decay to happen, the rest mass of the products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle.

Looking at the options, they list possible decay channels. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different fermion pairs.

So I need to find which fermion pairs have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Let's list the fermions and their masses.

Wait, but wait. For fermions, each decay would produce a pair like f and f-bar. So the total mass would be twice the mass of each fermion. So the sum of the masses of the two particles (each being a fermion and anti-fermion) must be less than the mass of X.

Wait, no. Actually, for a decay X → f f-bar, the minimum energy required is the sum of the rest masses of f and f-bar. Because each needs to have enough energy to create their rest mass. So for X to decay into f f-bar, the mass of X must be greater than 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion f.

So first, I need to find all fermions f where 2m_f < 6 GeV. Let's list the known fermion masses.

Fermions and their approximate masses (in GeV):

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.1057 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.0045 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
- Neutrinos: even lighter than electrons, negligible.

So let's calculate 2m_f for each possible fermion:

- e: 2*0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → way below 6 GeV → allowed.
- μ: 2*0.1057 = 0.211 GeV → allowed.
- τ: 2*1.777 = 3.554 GeV → which is less than 6 GeV → allowed.
- u: 2*0.003 = 0.006 → allowed.
- d: 2*0.0045 = 0.009 → allowed.
- s: 2*0.095 = 0.19 → allowed.
- c: 2*1.275 = 2.55 → allowed.
- b: 2*4.13 =
