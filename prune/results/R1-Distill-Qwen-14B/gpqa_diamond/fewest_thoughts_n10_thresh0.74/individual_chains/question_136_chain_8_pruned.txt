Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So, f(r) = [something]/r², but only in the radial direction.

Hmm, I remember that in vector calculus, the divergence of a vector field has certain properties, especially when the field is radial. Since the field is only radial, maybe the divergence calculation will be simpler.

Wait, the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that's purely radial. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² A_r) + ... other terms for angular components, but since our vector field only has a radial component, those terms drop out.

Right, so divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field f(r) = F(r) er (where er is the unit radial vector) is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)). So in this case, F(r) is 1/r². Let me plug that in.

So F(r) = 1/r². Therefore, r² F(r) is r²*(1/r²) = 1. The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence would be (1/r²) * 0 = 0. Wait, that can't be right because then the integral would be zero. But wait, is that correct? Because if the divergence is zero, the integral over any volume would be zero, right?

Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check. The divergence formula for a radial vector field F(r) er is indeed (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)). So F(r) is 1/r², so r² F(r) is 1. Taking the derivative with respect to r gives zero. So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the field might have a delta function. Because the divergence is zero everywhere else, the integral over the volume of the sphere (which doesn't include r=0 unless R is zero) would be zero. But wait, when R is non-zero, the origin is inside the sphere, so maybe we need to consider the delta function at the origin.

Ah, right! The divergence isn't just zero; the field might have a singularity at the origin. Let me think. If the vector field is like the electric field of a point charge, for example, which is radial and falls off as 1/r². The divergence of such a field is zero except at the origin, where there's a charge (a delta function in divergence).

Wait, but in this problem, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r². So it's similar to, say, the electric field of a point charge, which is (k q)/r² er. The divergence of that is 4π q δ³(r), where δ is the Dirac delta function. So the integral of the divergence over the sphere would be 4π q only if the sphere encloses the origin. But in this problem,
