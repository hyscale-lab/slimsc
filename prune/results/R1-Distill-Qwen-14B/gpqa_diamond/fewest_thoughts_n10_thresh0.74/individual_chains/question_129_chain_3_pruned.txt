Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through the question again. 

The question gives a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. Then, there are some hints and options to choose from. I need to figure out what E is based on the reactions and the hints.

Let me break down the reaction steps first.

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (probably nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, there are two hints provided. Hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, that sounds like a cyclopropane or maybe some ring structure. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent with a double bond, right? So maybe it's an alkyne or an alkene?

Hint b) talks about IR spectra. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group (like a ketone or an ester). Compound E has a strong peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl but maybe a different type. Wait, 1750 is higher, which could be an ester or maybe a ketone. 1715 is lower, perhaps an aldehyde or a ketone that's more substituted, or maybe an ester? Wait, aldehydes are around 2800 (stretch for aldehyde C-H) but their carbonyl is around 1720. Wait, but in the question, compound A's IR is 1750, which is higher, so maybe it's an ester or a ketone. Since the product E is 1715, perhaps a more substituted carbonyl? Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Hmm, not sure yet.

Let me think about each reaction step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups, like in ketones or aldehydes, forming cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, adding HCN would add a cyanide group to the carbonyl carbon. So perhaps A is a cyclic ketone.

But considering hint a), which involves a phosphorous ylide. Phosphorus ylides are typically used in alkyne synthesis, like the Wittig reaction. Oh wait, no—Wittig reagents are phosphorus ylides that form alkenes when they react with aldehydes or ketones. So if A reacts with a Wittig reagent to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests that A has a carbonyl group that reacts with the ylide to form a new double bond.

Wait, the product after Wittig is a cyclopent
