Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem. Let me read through it again and think about what each part means.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene sequencing. The problem is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm, so the idea is that the gene produces a compound that's bad, so we want to disrupt its synthesis. Probably, a mutation that affects the gene's function would do that. So, which mutation would disrupt the gene's coding sequence?

Looking at the sequences given. The intact gene is:

5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Each mutant has a change in the first exon area. Let's compare each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, the first part has changed. Let me line them up.

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT...

Wait, so the first few codons are changing. Let's see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG C...

So, I think the second codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), but in mutant 1, it's TTC (also Phe). So that's a silent mutation. Then the third codon: intact is CTC (Leu), mutant is TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr. Wait, no, CTC is Leu (CTC is Leucine, yes). TAC is Tyrosine. So that's an amino acid change. So the protein product might be altered.

But does that disrupt the compound production? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet. Let's look at the other mutants.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing again.

Intact has after ATG, TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 2: TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT...

So the second codon is TTC (Phe) again, same as Mutant 1. Third codon: TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon. Oh! So at position where the wild type has CTC (Leu), Mutant 2 has TAA, which is a stop. So this would cause a premature stop codon. The protein would be shorter. Maybe
