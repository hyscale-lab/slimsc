Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question is about the decay of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The problem is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's resolution here? I think it refers to the minimum distance that can be measured in the chamber. So particles moving quickly would travel a certain distance before decaying, and the chamber's resolution must be good enough to detect that. If the chamber can't resolve small enough distances, it might miss a lot of decays.

I remember that the lifetime of a moving particle is longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So when the particle is moving at a high speed, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the bubble chamber's frame) is longer. The formula for that is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

Lorentz factor γ is given by E/(m c²), right? Because the total energy E is γ m c². So γ would be E divided by the rest mass energy. Wait, but wait, the units here are in GeV. Let me confirm the units. Since E is given in GeV and mass m is also in GeV, so E = γ m c², so γ is E/(m c²). But wait, if E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², then E/(m c²) would have units of (GeV) / (GeV/c² * c²) ) =  (GeV) / (GeV) )= unitless, so that's correct.

So let's compute γ. E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 * 7.9 is approximately 27. So 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9. Let me do the exact calculation: 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 - 23.87 = 3.13 left. 3.13 /3.41 ≈ 0.918. So total γ is about 7.918, approximately 7.92.

So γ is about 7.92. Then the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 s. So τ = 7.92 * 8e-16. Let's compute that. 7.92 *8 is approximately
