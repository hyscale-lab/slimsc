Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy levels. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum, right?

Wait, dipole transitions follow certain selection rules. For the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are usually Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh right, because the dipole operator has components that change the angular momentum by one unit.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (which is an s orbital), m=0. And it wants to go to n=1, l=0, m=0. But it has to go through two dipole transitions, so it's a two-step process.

First transition: from n=3 to something, then from that state to n=1. Let's think about the possible intermediate states. The initial state is |3,0,0>. The first transition must follow the selection rules. So for l=0, the next possible l is 1 because l can change by ±1. So after the first transition, l becomes 1. Then, in the second transition, l must change back down to 0.

Wait, but wait. The initial state is l=0. So in the first transition, l can go to 1 (since Δl = +1), but wait, Δl for dipole transitions is from l to l±1, right? So from 0, possible l's are 1. So after first transition, the state is |n',1,m'>. Then, from that state, to reach |1,0,0>, the next transition must have l going from 1 to 0, since again, Δl can be -1. So that's possible.

So intermediate state must be for n=2 or maybe n=4 but wait, the final state is n=1. Let me think about the possible steps.

The initial state is n=3, l=0. The possible first transitions would change n to either 2 or 4, but wait, because when you make a dipole transition, n can change by ±1. Wait, no, the selection rule for n is a bit more flexible. Actually, in hydrogen, the principal quantum
