Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a pretty complex organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me think through this step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I'll try to visualize its structure. I think it's a molecule with multiple double bonds and branching. Oh wait, looking at the formula, there are two C=C double bonds. That might be important because double bonds have higher bond energies.

The question provides the enthalpy of atomization for carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an atom to form separate atoms. So for carbon, which is tetravalent, that would mean breaking four C-C bonds or something else? Wait, no, atomization is usually about breaking into individual atoms. So for carbon, which is a solid, getting each carbon atom free, maybe considering the energy to break all bonds in graphite or something. But for the purposes of this problem, I'll just use the given value.

The bond energies provided are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation. Enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for this hydrocarbon, the elements would be carbon (solid, maybe graphite) and hydrogen gas (H2).

The formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf = (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds formed)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by assuming that the molecule is built from its constituent atoms. So we consider the energy required to break all bonds in the elements (atomization) and then the energy released when the molecule's bonds form.

So the general formula is:

ΔHf = [Σ (atomization energies of elements)] - [Σ (bond energies in the molecule)]

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies. The standard way is
