Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about Michael additions, right? I remember that the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The product is an enolate, and it's a really important reaction in organic synthesis.

Looking at the problem, there are three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C, and I need to determine the major products of each. Then, I have to match them with the options given (A, B, C, D) which list possible products for each. 

Let's tackle each part one by one.

First, Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). 

I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diethyl malonate derivative. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in Michael addition, the nucleophile is the enolate. Oh wait, but wait, here, the first compound is dimethyl malonate, which is a diester. Under basic conditions (like NaOEt), it should form the enolate. The enolate would attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituent at the E position. Wait, actually, the structure is more accurately CH2-CO-OCH3 with the substituent at position 3. Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. The acrylate part is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but since it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, I think the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3.
