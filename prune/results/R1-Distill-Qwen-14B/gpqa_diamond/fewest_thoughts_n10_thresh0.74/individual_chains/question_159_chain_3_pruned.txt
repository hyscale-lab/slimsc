Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question is about the comoving distance of a quasar given certain observations and cosmological parameters.

The observations are in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, that's probably the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to the quasar's emission line. Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the rest frame. But if the observed wavelength is longer, that's due to redshift. So, the quasar's light is being redshifted.

The peak is at 790 nm. So, I think I can calculate the redshift. The formula for redshift is z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength - 1. So, rest is 121 nm, observed is 790 nm. Let me compute that. 790 / 121 is approximately 6.5289. Subtract 1, so z is about 5.5289? Wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the peak is the Lyman-alpha absorption? No, the question says it's a peak, so perhaps it's emission. Or maybe it's the 912 Angstrom (91.2 nm) Lyman limit? No, wait, I'm getting mixed up. Lyman-alpha is 121 nm, Lyman-beta is 102.6 nm, but wait, maybe it's the Balmer limit? Not sure, but I think for quasars, the Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent feature.

So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer than 121 nm. So, z would be (790 / 121) - 1. Let me compute that: 790 divided by 121 is roughly 6.5289. So 6.5289 minus 1 is z ≈ 5.5289. Let's call it z ≈ 5.53.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance at a=1. Wait, wait, comoving distance is D_c,
