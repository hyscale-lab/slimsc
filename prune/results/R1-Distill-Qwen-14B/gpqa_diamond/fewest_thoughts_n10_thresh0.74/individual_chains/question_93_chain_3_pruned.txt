Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran qPCR on serially diluted samples, doing three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that in qPCR, a slope around -3.32 is considered ideal for a 100% efficient reaction because the formula involves log base 10, so the ideal slope is -3.32. So his slope is close enough, maybe a bit off, but maybe within acceptable limits.

Looking at the results, the Ct values for each dilution are given. Let's list them out:

100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6
10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3

Wait, each dilution is a tenfold decrease. So each step is 1/10th the previous concentration. Now, the Ct values increase as the concentration decreases, which makes sense because lower starting amounts take longer to reach the threshold (higher Ct).

The question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options suggest possible explanations for these discrepancies.

Looking at the options. Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. That can't be right because qPCR is used for quantification. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target amounts. But wait, his R² is 1, so the curve fits perfectly. So the Ct values do correlate with the amount, meaning the data is consistent. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Let me think. Each tenfold dilution should ideally result in a change of about 3.32 Ct values if efficiency is 100%. So for example, from 100,000 to 10,000 copies (a tenfold decrease), the Ct should increase by about 3.32. Let's calculate the difference between the first two points. 33.9 (from 100,000) and 30.6 (from 10,000). The difference is about 3.3, which is very close to the expected 3.32. Similarly, the next step: 30.6 to 27.3 is 3.3, same for all. So each tenfold dilution gives a change of about 3.3 Ct. So option C says ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles, but here it's exactly 3.3. Hmm, maybe the point is that a 10-fold change should correspond to a 3.32 change, but in this case, it's 3.3. So perhaps the slope is a bit off, but option C's statement is about whether ten-fold is more than 3.3, which in this case, it's exactly 3.3, so no. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the slope. The slope was -3.3, which is close to ideal. So maybe the problem isn't with the dilution causing more cycles, but perhaps something else.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Let's look at the replicates. For 100,00
