Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and start breaking it down.

The question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, that sounds familiar. I think that's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx, and the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So yeah, this must be a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The problem asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. But wait, since it's isotropic, each direction (x, y, z) behaves like a 1D harmonic oscillator, and the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

In the 3D case, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are the quantum numbers for each direction, each being a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, ...).

Alternatively, I think it's sometimes expressed in terms of a total quantum number n, where n = n_x + n_y + n
