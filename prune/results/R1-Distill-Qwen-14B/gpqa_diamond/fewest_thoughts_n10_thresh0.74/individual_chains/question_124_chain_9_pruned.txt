Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. The setup is that these particles are produced and then they move at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, alright. So I think this has to do with the particles' velocity and the distance they can travel before decaying. Since they are moving at a certain speed, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame would be affected by time dilation because of their high velocity. The longer the lifetime, the more likely they are to reach the detector's walls.

Wait, the problem mentions that they are ultra-relativistic, so their gamma factor (Lorentz factor) is significant. The initial gamma is 20, and one third reach the walls. We need to find a gamma such that two-thirds reach.

I remember that the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The formula for the decay length (L) is L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame), and c is the speed of light.

But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau. So if a particle's lifetime is longer, it can travel a longer distance before decaying. So, the fraction of particles that reach the detector's walls depends on whether their decay length is longer than the radius of the detector.

Wait, but in the initial scenario, with gamma 20, one third reach. So I guess that's because only one third have a decay length longer than 30 meters. Wait, no, because the decay length is the average. So the number that reach depends on whether the decay length is longer than the detector's radius. So if the decay length is longer, more particles will have decayed before reaching the wall, but maybe it's the opposite. Wait, no: if the average decay length is longer than the detector's radius, then more particles will reach the walls. Because the detector is 30 meters in radius, so
