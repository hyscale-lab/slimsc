Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that particles like mesons can decay, and the mean decay distance depends on their lifetime, right? But wait, how exactly do I calculate that?

The question gives me some specific values: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in terms of meters, so I need to figure out the decay length in meters.

Wait, I think the decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So it's c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), where c is the speed of light. But how do I find the lifetime from the given data?

I remember that the width Γ is related to the lifetime through the uncertainty principle. Specifically, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ℏ/2. For a resonance, the width Γ is the uncertainty in energy, and the lifetime τ is approximately the uncertainty in time. So Γ * τ ≈ ℏ, but I think the exact relation is Γ = ℏ/τ. Wait, no, more accurately, Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ
