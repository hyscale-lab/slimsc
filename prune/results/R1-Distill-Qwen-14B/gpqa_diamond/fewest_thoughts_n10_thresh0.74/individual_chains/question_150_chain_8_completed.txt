Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me first think about the NMR data provided. The 1H-NMR is given as:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

So, I need to figure out what structure this corresponds to, based on the NMR. Then, after reacting it with certain reagents, I have to determine the final product from the options.

First, let's try to interpret the NMR. The peaks can give us information about the functional groups and the structure of the molecule.

Starting with the peak at 9.72 ppm. That's a triplet (t), integrating to 1H. A triplet at around 9-10 ppm is often an aldehyde proton. Wait, because aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm and as a triplet, maybe it's part of an enal system, like a conjugated aldehyde with adjacent groups. But wait, sometimes other protons can peak around there, like an acidic proton, but that's less likely here.

Next, looking at the aromatic region. The 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d) for 2H. Another doublet at 6.51 ppm for 2H. These are probably adjacent protons on a benzene ring. Wait, that makes me think of a para-substituted benzene ring because the doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the protons are equivalent and would be doublets if they're coupled to each other. Alternatively, maybe these are part of a meta or ortho substitution, but I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another thing: The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broadly suggests maybe some exchange happening, like an -OH group nearby, but as a singlet, perhaps two equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe these are vinyl protons next to an electron-withdrawing group, making them deshielded. Hmm.

Then the 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That region is typical for CH2 groups adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester. Or perhaps a CH2 next to an aldehyde or another electronegative atom.

So putting this together. Let me try to imagine the structure.

The aldehyde at 9.72 ppm suggests an aldehyde group. But wait, could it be something else? Like an enamine or something else? Not sure. But aldehyde is a good starting point.

The aromatic regions: maybe two benzene rings, each substituted with something. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm might be protons from two different benzene rings. Wait, but each is a doublet of 2H. That suggests each benzene ring has two equivalent protons, perhaps para-substituted, so each ring has two Hs in a para position. Wait, but if a benzene ring is para-substituted, the protons are equivalent and would be a singlet if there's no coupling. Wait, but they are doublets. Hmm, maybe the rings are attached to each other or to another group, leading to coupling across the rings.

Alternatively, maybe these are two different aromatic systems. Let's think: perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings connected by some chain, maybe a butene chain. The 3.66 ppm could be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, perhaps in a -O-CH2-CH2- structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 3.66 ppm doublet of 2H could be adjacent to another CH2 group. Like maybe a CH2-CHO group, where the CH2 is next to the aldehyde. The doublet would come from coupling with the adjacent CH2.

Wait, but the 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which suggests the proton is coupling with two equivalent protons. So if it's an aldehyde, the aldehyde proton (R-CHO) would have coupling with adjacent protons. But in an aldehyde, the proton is at the end, so maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CH2-CHO, but in a conjugated system.

Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde is part of an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde). So maybe a conjugated diene with an aldehyde. For example, something like CH2=CH-CHO. But that's a bit small for the molecule.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated by:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO.

So substituting:

C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1 ) /2 = (18-9-1+1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I must have made a mistake. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So X is 0 (no halogens given), N=1, O=1.

So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5.

So five degrees of unsaturation. That can be from rings and double bonds. Five could be a combination of a ring and double bonds.

Now, how to fit this into the structure.

Looking back at the NMR, the 6.27 ppm (2H, bs) suggests either two equivalent protons in an aromatic ring or perhaps a diene system. Alternatively, maybe they're part of an enol structure or something with exchange.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm could be the protons adjacent to an aldehyde group in an enal system. For example, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CHO, but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, it's possible that the molecule has two benzene rings attached to a central chain. Let's think about the structure of the starting compound.

Wait, considering the reagents used later: first, NaNO2 and HCl. That's typically used for diazotization of an aromatic amine, especially under cold conditions (like 0-5°C). Then, H2O would be a workup, maybe hydrolysis. The third reagent is aqueous KOH with heat, which is typical for elimination or alkylation reactions, perhaps a Hofmann elimination or some kind of elimination to form a double bond.

But wait, the starting material is C8H9NO. So with an N, perhaps it's an amine or an amide or something else. The molecular formula after the reactions might change, but let's focus on the starting material.

Wait, but the product options are all aldehydes or ketones or something similar. Hmm.

Wait, the starting compound... Let me think again about the NMR.

Looking at the 9.72 ppm triplet: maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but in an environment where it's coupled with two neighboring protons. So perhaps the structure is something like R-CH2-CHO, but then the coupling would be with the CH2 group. So the aldehyde proton would be a triplet if it's adjacent to a CH2 group which is split by neighboring groups.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents causing coupling.

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets (each 2H) suggest possibly two sets of para-substituted benzene rings. Let me think: each ring has two substituents, perhaps in para positions, leading to two doublets. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. For example, maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2-. Or perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

Putting all this together, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound where the two benzene rings are connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde group and some CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like diphenylbut-3-enal. Let me think: the aldehyde is at one end (the 9.72 ppm peak), with a conjugated double bond. Then, attached to the other end, two benzene rings.

Wait, but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzalacetophenone or something similar, but with the substituents.

Wait, another approach: let's try to count the number of signals. We have five signals, which suggests a relatively symmetric structure. So maybe some equivalent protons.

Let me think about the possible structure. If the molecule is a di-substituted benzaldehyde, where the substituents are causing the NMR signals.

Wait, but the two aromatic doublets (6.98 and 6.51) could correspond to two para-substituted benzene rings, each with two protons. So each ring is probably attached to a substituent in the para position, and maybe the substituent is a group that's part of the main chain.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the initial structure. Maybe I should try to think about the reaction steps and see if that gives any clues about the starting material.

The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. aq. KOH, Heat

First, NaNO2 and HCl. That's the standard conditions for diazotization of an aromatic amine, especially a primary amine. So the starting material likely has an aromatic amine group (like an aniline derivative), which is being converted to a diazonium salt.

Then, reaction with H2O. Diazonium salts can undergo hydrolysis under certain conditions. For example, if it's an aryl diazonium salt, heating with water (like in a Sandmeyer reaction) can lead to substitution, but without a catalyst, maybe it's a simple substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, after diazotization, the next step is H2O. So maybe it's a hydrolysis to form a phenol. Because when an aryl diazonium salt is treated with water (especially under acidic or basic conditions), it can form a phenol. So for example, if you have an aryl diazonium chloride, treating it with water would replace the diazo group (-N2Cl) with an -OH group.

Then the third step is aqueous KOH and heat. That sounds like a strong base condition, possibly leading to elimination reactions. For example, if there's a leaving group adjacent to a CH2 group, KOH could cause elimination to form a double bond.

So putting it all together, the starting material probably has an aromatic amine group (so aniline derivative) which is converted to a diazonium salt, then hydrolyzed to a phenol, and then perhaps an elimination occurs to form a double bond.

Wait, but looking at the product options, all are aldehydes or related structures. So perhaps the starting material was a benzalacetophenone derivative with an amine group, which upon reaction converts to a phenol and forms a double bond.

Wait, let me think again. If the starting compound is a benzalacetophenone with an amino group attached to the benzene ring, then:

1. Diazotization converts the amine to a diazonium salt.
2. Hydrolysis replaces the diazonium group with -OH, making a phenol.
3. Then, treatment with KOH and heat could cause an elimination reaction, perhaps removing a water molecule to form a double bond.

So, maybe the starting material is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. Let me see if that makes sense.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count:

If it's aniline derivative: benzene ring (C6H5) plus a substituent. The substituent would be something like CH2-CH2-CHO, but let me check:

C6H5-CH2-CHO would be C7H7O, but the formula is C8H9NO, so perhaps the substituent is more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2-CH2-NH2 group. Wait, but that would give more hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diphenylamine derivative. For example, diphenylmethane with an aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached to the benzene ring, and another substituent.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product options.

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal.

Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO.

Wait, but that's but-3-enal, meaning the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but I think but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO. Hmm, not sure.

Option B: 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-2-enal.

Structure: (PhOH)2C-CH2-CHO? No, but-2-enal would be CH2=CH-CHO.

Wait, perhaps it's (PhOH)CH2-CH2-CHO, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Option C: 3-hydroxy-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butanal.

But that would be a longer chain with multiple hydroxyphenyl groups.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

So structure: CH2=CH-CH(PhOH)-CHO?

Wait, but but-3-enal would have the double bond between C3 and C4. So for butanal, it's four carbons, aldehyde at the end. But-3-enal would be CH2CH2-CH=CHO? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, but-3-enal would be CH2CH2-CH=CHO. Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, maybe it's:

Structure for D: CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OH? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structures.

Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal.

So the but-3-enal part is CH2CH2CHO, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but butanal is four carbons, so positions are 1 (CHO), 2, 3, 4. So but-3-enal would be CH2CH2-CH2-CHO but with a double bond between 3 and 4. Hmm, that doesn't seem possible because that would be beyond the aldehyde.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: butanal is CH3CH2CH2CHO (butyraldehyde), but but-3-enal would have double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible as the aldehyde is at C1, so the chain would be C1 (CHO), C2, C3, C4. So but-3-enal would have double bond between C3 and C4, but that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm thinking in the wrong way.

Alternatively, perhaps but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. Because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but that would be but-1-enal. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the nomenclature here.

Wait, but the key point is, after the reactions, the product has an aldehyde group. So the starting material must have an amine group that becomes a phenol, and perhaps the elimination creates a double bond, leading to an aldehyde.

Wait, but how does the starting material with an aldehyde group (as per the NMR) react?

Wait, the starting material's NMR shows an aldehyde proton. So the starting material has an aldehyde group. So the starting material is an aldehyde with an amino group attached to a benzene ring.

Wait, but if the starting material is an aldehyde, then when you treat it with NaNO2 and HCl, it would undergo diazotization if there's an amino group attached to the benzene ring.

So, structure: benzaldehyde with an amino group attached para to the aldehyde.

Wait, but that's not the molecular formula. Let me see. The molecular formula is C8H9NO.

If it's a benzaldehyde with an amino group, that would be C7H7NO. But our compound is C8H9NO. So maybe it's diphenyl something.

Wait, another approach: the starting material could be 4-aminophenylpropenal or something similar.

Wait, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde would be C8H9NO.

Wait, let me count: benzene (C6H5), then a CH2-CHO group (so C2H3O), and an NH2 group.

Wait, but that would be C6H5-CH(NH2)-CHO. Let's count the carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (CH and CHO) + 1 (NH2 is a substituent, not adding a carbon). So 6+2=8, but the formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CHO. Let's see: that would be C9, which is more than the given formula. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound with a chain that includes an aldehyde and an amine.

Wait, perhaps it's diphenylbut-3-enal with an amino group on one of the phenyl rings.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the possible NMR signals.

The 9.72 ppm triplet (1H) is probably the aldehyde proton. The triplet implies that it's adjacent to a CH2 group which has two protons. So the structure might be R-CHO where R is CH2-CH2-Ph or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. But that's just a butyl group attached to benzene. But then the NMR would have other signals.

Wait, but the NMR shows aromatic protons as 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H). Let me think of a para-substituted benzene. For example, the substituent is in the para position, so the ring has two protons in each of two sets of doublets.

Wait, but that would imply two different substituents on the benzene ring, each causing their own set of doublets. Or perhaps it's a biphenyl structure.

Wait, maybe the molecule is diphenylbut-3-enal. So two benzene rings attached to a but-3-enal chain.

In that case, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with another benzene ring attached somewhere else. Hmm, perhaps the but-3-enal is in the middle, connected to two benzene rings.

Wait, but but-3-enal is CH2=CHCH2CHO, so the chain is four carbons with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, but that would be pentanal, not butanal.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structure, so perhaps I should think about the reaction steps again.

The reaction steps:

1. Diazotization (NaNO2, HCl) → forms a diazonium salt.
2. H2O → likely hydrolysis to form a phenol.
3. Aqueous KOH, heat → elimination reaction, perhaps forming a double bond.

So the starting material must have an aromatic amine group that is converted to a phenol. Then, the elimination step forms a double bond, possibly creating an aldehyde.

Wait, but the starting material already has an aldehyde group, so perhaps the elimination is creating a new double bond adjacent to the aldehyde.

So, maybe the starting material is 4-(aminophenyl)butanal. Then after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes 4-(hydroxyphenyl)butanal. Then, the elimination step with KOH and heat forms a double bond, making it an enal.

Wait, but the product options have aldehydes as well. So maybe the starting material is a secondary amine adjacent to a carbonyl group, which upon elimination forms a double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the starting material is 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. So, Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an amino group on the benzene ring.

Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, the amino group becomes a hydroxyl, so Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO becomes Ph-OH-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with an amino group on the benzene. So, 4-aminophenylpropanal. Then, after diazotization and hydrolysis, it becomes 4-hydroxyphenylpropanal. Then, treatment with KOH and heat could cause elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

So, the initial structure would be 4-(aminophenyl)propanal. The formula is C8H9NO: benzene (6 C), propanal (3 C, but wait, 4-(aminophenyl)propanal would be C6H5-CH2-CH2-CHO, which is 6 + 3 = 9 C, but the formula is C8. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

So that's not possible. Maybe it's a shorter chain.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminobenzaldehyde, but that's C7H7NO, but our compound is C8H9NO. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a diphenyl compound. Let's think: two benzene rings connected by a chain that includes an aldehyde and an amine.

Wait, if the structure is diphenylacetaldehyde with an amino group attached. For example, (Ph)2CH-CHO with an amino group somewhere.

Wait, but that would be C13H11NO, which is way beyond the given formula. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's aniline with a side chain that includes an aldehyde. For example, 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde.

So, structure: benzene ring with NH2 at para position, and a CH2CHO group attached. So, C6H4(NH2)-CH2-CHO.

The molecular formula would be C8H7NO, but the given formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminophenylpropionaldehyde. Then, the formula would be C9H11NO, which is higher than what's given. So that's not it.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the NMR again.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a doublet, which suggests two protons coupled with each other, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom. So maybe it's a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2 or CH2CHO.

Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm. So perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CHO, with the CH2 connected to a benzene ring.

Wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets are probably two different sets of aromatic protons, each in a para-substituted position. So perhaps the molecule has two benzene rings, each with a substituent.

Wait, maybe the structure is diphenylacetaldehyde, which is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. But let's see:

Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. The NMR would have:

- Aldehyde proton at ~9.7 ppm, triplet if adjacent to a CH2 group.
- The CH2 groups: the CH2 next to the aldehyde would be around 3.66 ppm as a doublet. Then the other CH2 would be another peak, perhaps around 2.5 or similar.
- The aromatic protons would be the two Ph groups. Each would have a doublet if they're para-substituted, but that depends on the substituents.

Wait, diphenylacetaldehyde would have two benzene rings attached to a propanal chain. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. The aromatic protons in each benzene ring would be in a para-substituted position, leading to two doublets: one for each ring's protons. So that could account for the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm signals.

But wait, each benzene ring in diphenylacetaldehyde would have equivalent protons, so each would have a singlet, not a doublet. Hmm, that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on each benzene ring is not the same. For example, one ring has an amino group, and the other has a substituent that leads to different coupling.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminophenylpropiolic aldehyde. No, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzalacetophenone, but with an amino group.

Wait, another approach: the NMR shows two sets of aromatic doublets. So perhaps each benzene ring has a substituent that is causing the protons to split into doublets. For example, if each ring has an electron-withdrawing group in the para position, causing the adjacent protons to split.

Wait, but the starting material has an amino group (since it's undergoing diazotization). So one of the rings must have an amino group.

So, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde linked to another benzene ring via a chain.

Wait, but then the chain would need to have other groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diphenylbut-3-enal with an amino group on one of the rings. For example, Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with an amino on one benzene ring. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to count the NMR signals again:

1. 9.72 (t, 1H) → aldehyde proton.
2. 6.98 (d, 2H) → aromatic protons (probably from one benzene ring).
3. 6.51 (d, 2H) → aromatic protons (probably from another benzene ring).
4. 6.27 (bs, 2H) → maybe some vinylic protons or protons adjacent to an electronegative group.
5. 3.66 (d, 2H) → CH2 group next to something electronegative, like O or CHO.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is 4-amino-2-phenylbut-3-enal. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the 6.27 (bs, 2H) could be the protons adjacent to the aldehyde in an enal system. So, for example, in a structure like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, but with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, if the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO, then the CH2 groups would show up around 3.66 and maybe another peak for the other CH2. But the NMR only shows one peak for CH2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CHO, but that's benzyl aldehyde, which wouldn't account for the other aromatic signals.

Wait, another idea: the starting material is a diphenylamine derivative with an aldehyde group. Maybe something like (Ph)2NH-CHO. But that's not correct because the formula wouldn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde with an amino group attached to a benzene ring, and another benzene ring attached via a chain.

Wait, perhaps it's 4-(aminophenyl)but-3-enal. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(PhNH2)-CHO.

But then the molecular formula would be C11H11N O, which is higher than C8H9NO. So that's not right.

Wait, maybe the structure is more compact. Like, a benzalacetophenone derivative with an amino group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-aminobenzaldehyde linked to another benzene ring via a CH2 group.

Wait, let's calculate the molecular formula for 4-aminobenzaldehyde: C7H7NO.

But our compound is C8H9NO. So perhaps it's diphenyl with a chain that includes NH2 and CHO.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule is diphenylacetaldehyde with an amino group on one of the rings. So, structure: Ph-CH2-CHO-Ph.

Wait, but that would have the formula C12H10O, which doesn't match.

I'm really stuck on the initial structure. Maybe I should think about the product options and see which one would result from the given reactions.

The product options are all aldehydes with phenyl groups. So the final product must be an aldehyde with phenol groups attached.

Looking at the reactions:

1. Diazotization → forms a diazonium salt.
2. Water → hydrolyzes the diazonium to a phenol.
3. KOH and heat → elimination, perhaps forming a double bond.

So, the starting material has an aromatic amine that becomes a phenol. Then, elimination forms a double bond, leading to an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an aniline derivative with a substituent that upon elimination forms the aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a secondary amine attached to a carbonyl group. Then, diazotization isn't applicable because secondary amines don't form diazonium salts under those conditions. So, the starting material must have a primary aromatic amine.

So the starting material is an aniline derivative with another functional group.

After diazotization and hydrolysis, the amino group becomes a phenol. Then, elimination with KOH and heat forms a double bond, possibly converting a carbonyl into an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylacetone. Structure: Ph-CH2-CO-NH2.

But upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl, the amine would form a diazonium salt. Then, hydrolysis would replace the diazo group with a hydroxyl, giving Ph-CH2-COH. Then, treatment with KOH and heat could cause dehydration, forming Ph-CH2-CO-OH → elimination to Ph-CO-CHO? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylpropanal. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group on the benzene.

Wait, but the formula would be C8H9NO. Let's see:

Ph is C6H5. Then, CH2-CH2-CHO is C3H5O. But wait, that's 6+3=9 C, but the formula is C8. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is 4-aminophenylacetaldehyde. C6H5-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group on the benzene. So the formula is C8H7NO. But the given formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, not matching. So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylpropionaldehyde. C6H5-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group on the benzene. The formula would be C9H11NO, which is more than C8H9NO. So that's not it.

I think I'm stuck on the initial structure. Maybe I should think about the NMR again.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) could be a CH2 group between two carbonyls, but in this case, perhaps it's adjacent to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 next to the aldehyde would be at 3.66 ppm as a doublet. The other CH2 would be around 2.5 ppm as a triplet.

But in the given NMR, there's no peak around 2.5 ppm. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is part of a cyclic structure, but that's hard to see.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm (2H, bs) could be the protons adjacent to the aldehyde in a conjugated system. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-CHO, the vinyl protons would be around 6.27 ppm as a broad signal due to coupling or possibly exchange effects.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylpropenal. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH=CHO with an amino group on the benzene.

Upon hydrolysis, the amino becomes a hydroxyl, forming Ph-CH2-CH=CH-OH. Then, elimination with KOH and heat could form a longer double bond, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated enal system.

Wait, considering the product options, option D is 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal. So, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH-OH attached to a benzene ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enal (conjugated aldehyde and double bond), which would have the aldehyde at one end and a double bond adjacent.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is 4-aminophenylpropanal. Structure: Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with an NH2 group on the benzene.

After diazotization, it becomes Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO with a diazo group on the benzene. Hydrolysis replaces the diazo with -OH, giving Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, treatment with KOH and heat could cause dehydration, forming a double bond. So, elimination would occur between the CH2 groups, forming a double bond and releasing water. The product would be Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination, Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph(OH)-CH=CH-CHO.

Wait, but that would require the presence of a suitable leaving group, which I'm not sure exists in this case.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination forms a conjugated enal. So, the product would be Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CHO → Ph(OH)-CH2-CH2-CHO → upon elimination, Ph(OH)-CH=CH-CHO. But that's but-3-enal if the chain is four carbons.

Wait, but the product options have but-3-enal, so perhaps that's the case.

So, putting it all together, the final product would be 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal, which is option D.

I think that's the correct answer.


The compound has the molecular formula **C₈H₉NO** and the given **¹H-NMR data** is analyzed as follows:

1. **9.72 ppm (t, 1H)**: This is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, likely part of an enal system.
2. **6.98 ppm (d, 2H)** and **6.51 ppm (d, 2H)**: These are doublets corresponding to aromatic protons, suggesting two para-substituted benzene rings.
3. **6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely due to vinylic protons in a conjugated system.
4. **3.66 ppm (d, 2H)**: A doublet for a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom, such as an aldehyde.

The **reaction sequence** involves:
1. **NaNO₂ + HCl**: Diazotization of an aromatic amine.
2. **H₂O**: Hydrolysis of the diazonium salt to form a phenol.
3. **Aqueous KOH, Heat**: Elimination reaction to form a double bond.

From the NMR data and molecular formula, the starting material is identified as **4-aminophenylbut-3-enal**. The reactions convert the amino group to a hydroxyl group, forming **4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**. The elimination step with KOH and heat ensures the formation of the conjugated enal system.

The **final product** matches **Option D: 4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)but-3-enal**, which has the structure CH₂=CH-CH(PhOH)-CHO.
