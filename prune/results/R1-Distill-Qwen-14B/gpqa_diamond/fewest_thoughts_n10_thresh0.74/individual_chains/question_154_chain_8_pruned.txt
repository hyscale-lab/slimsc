Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here where I need to identify an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, let's see. The question gives me options A to D, each a different organic compound. The data provided includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR.

First, let's go through each piece of data step by step.

The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%) and another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Wait, the molecular ion is the highest peak, so the molecular weight should be 156 g/mol. The 158 peak could be an isotope. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance. Chlorine-35 is about 75% and Cl-37 is about 25%. So, if the molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion would have a 37Cl isotope peak. Let me think: the molecular weight is 156, and the isotope is 158. So 156 and 158 would correspond to Cl-35 and Cl-37, respectively. The molecular ion is at 156, but wait, no, because for Cl, the molecular ion would have an average. Oh wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think: if the molecular formula includes Cl, which has a mass of about 35 (approx 34.97). So if the molecular ion is at 156, but 158 is 2 mass units higher. So maybe there's a Cl in the structure. Because Cl has a natural abundance of about 75% for Cl-35 and 25% for Cl-37. So the molecular ion (M) would be at m/z 156, and the Cl isotope (M+2) would be at 158 with about 32% intensity. That makes sense because 25% of Cl would lead to a 32% peak if considering possible other factors. So the presence of Cl is indicated.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually suggest O-H stretches, like from alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be an amine, but looking at the options, none are amines. The IR also shows a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The position of 1720 suggests it's possibly an ester, acid, or aldehyde. Let's think about each possibility. A carboxylic acid has a broad O-H stretch, an aldehyde has a peak around 2800 (for the aldehyde C-H), but in IR, the carbonyl for aldehyde is around
