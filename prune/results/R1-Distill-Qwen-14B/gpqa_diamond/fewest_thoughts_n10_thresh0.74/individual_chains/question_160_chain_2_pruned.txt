Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field. Hmm.

Wait, the aperture is a regular polygon, so all sides are equal and all angles are the same. The apothems are all of length 'a'—the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, right? So for a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the side length and the number of sides.

When light passes through this aperture, it's like a diffraction scenario. The far field means we're looking at the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, so the intensity variations result from the interference of light diffracted by each point in the aperture.

But wait, for a polygon with a large number of sides N, when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle. Because as N increases, the polygon approximates a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture? Because the first minima in a circular aperture is known.

Wait, but the question says N is infinitely large, so it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be the same as a circular aperture. But I'm not sure if that's correct because the problem starts by considering a polygon, but as N approaches infinity, it becomes a circle.

In the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot, and the first minimum occurs at an angle θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. Wait, no, wait—Wait, the formula I remember is sinθ = 1.22 λ / (π a), no, wait. Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, the Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture has the first minimum at θ where sinθ = 1.22 λ / D, with D being the diameter. But wait, in terms of the apothem 'a', how does D relate?

The apothem 'a' for a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) as a = R cos(π/N). But when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem becomes equal to the radius because each side becomes infinitesimally small, but wait, no.

Wait, wait. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is the radius of the inscribed circle. The radius of the circumscribed circle is R = a / cos(π/N). So for a very large N, R ≈ a (1 - (π²)/(2N²)) ) approximately, using Taylor expansion. But as N approaches infinity, R approaches a because cos(π/N) approaches 1. So for a circular aperture, the radius R is equal to the apothem a? Or wait, no. Wait, the apothem a is the distance from the center to the side, which for a circle would be the same as the radius? Because in a circle, the apothem is the radius, right? So when N is very large, the apoth
