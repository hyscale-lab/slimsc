Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's see. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so three spins would have 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to calculate each state's energy and then sum up their Boltzmann factors.

First, let's figure out all possible states and their corresponding energies. Each S_i can be +1 or -1. Let me list all combinations:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   Then S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E= J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1 =-1. E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1= -1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   All products are 1, sum is 3. E= -3J.

Wait, let me double-check the sums for each state. State 1: 3, that's correct. State 2: 1 (S1S2) + (-1) (S1S3) + (-1) (S2S3) = 1-1-1 = -1, so E= J*1= J. Similarly, others: for states 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the sum is -1 each. State 8: sum is 3, E=-3J.

So each state's energy is either -3J or J. How many states have each energy? Looking at the list, state 1 and state 8 are the only ones with E=-3J. So two states with E=-3J. The remaining 6 states have E= J.

So the partition function Z is the sum of exp(-βE) for each state.

Each of the two states with E1 = -3J contributes exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ). Similarly, each of the six states with E2=J contributes exp(-β*J) = exp(-Jβ).

So Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} + 6 * e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{Jβ} → No, because 2 is multiplied by e^(-3Jβ), which would be if E was +3J.

Wait wait, no. Wait, the energy is E = -J(...), so for the case where the total is 3, E is -3J. So when calculating exp(-β E), it's exp(3Jβ). So that's correct. So Z = 2 * e^{3Jβ} +6 * e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A is 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^{J
