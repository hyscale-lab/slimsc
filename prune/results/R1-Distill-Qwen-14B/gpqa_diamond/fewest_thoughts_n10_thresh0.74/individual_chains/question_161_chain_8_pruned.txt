Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in the vacuum. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. So, the setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope at 1000 kV. He's connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as much gas as possible because gas molecules can interfere with the electron beam, right?

But even with all that pumping, some gas particles are still there. They detected that with a mass spectrometer. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I think. It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that variable isn't changing. But why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

Wait, mean free path in gases is usually given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the mean collision diameter. Oh, right, n is inversely proportional to pressure (since n = P/(kT), maybe?), so lower pressure (higher vacuum) gives a longer mean free path.

In this situation, before the electron beam is turned on, the vacuum is at some pressure, and the mean free path is λ1. But when the beam is on, the gas in the compartment might be getting ionized or excited somehow. Oh, wait, electrons in the beam can interact with the gas molecules.

Wait, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might become charged. Electrons hitting the gas can cause them to lose or gain electrons—ionization. So, if the gas becomes ionized, that could change their behavior. Because ionized particles (ions) have a charge, they would interact more strongly with each other and with the walls or other particles.

Wait, but wait. If the gas particles are neutral, their mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas particles might become ionized. So now, the gas has ions and electrons. How does ionization affect the mean free path?

Ions have a charge, so they would experience stronger electric fields. But in a vacuum, are there any electric fields present? The electron beam itself is a source of electric fields, perhaps. Alternatively, ions might be accelerated or attracted to the beam.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit off track. The main point is that the presence of the electron beam affects the gas. So perhaps the gas particles are more likely to collide now, either with each other or with the walls.

Wait, but the mean free path is the average distance between collisions. If the conditions change such that collisions happen more frequently, the mean free path would be shorter. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but what conditions make collisions more frequent? Higher pressure, but the pressure is already ultra-low. Hmm. Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, maybe the effective cross-section for collisions increases because charged particles might interact more strongly.

Oh, right! The mean free path depends on the collision diameter.
