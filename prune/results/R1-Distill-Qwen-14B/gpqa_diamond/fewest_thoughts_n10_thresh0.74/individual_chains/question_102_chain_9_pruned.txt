Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a genetic construct and why a fluorescent signal isn't showing up. Hmm, I remember that constructs like this often use things like loxP sites and IRES elements for regulation.

So, the setup: They made a bicistronic vector with the ligand and receptor. The ligand is at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. Both have stop cassettes with loxP and another with lox2272. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. They used Cre to recombine these.

Wait, what's the normal setup here? Oh right, in a bicistronic vector, both ORFs are under a single promoter but have internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or other elements to allow separate translation. But in this case, each has a stop cassette. So, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor has an IRES, which is a weaker way of driving expression because it allows for separate translation without a separate promoter.

They used Cre to delete the stop cassettes. The vector uses loxP and lox2272. When Cre is expressed, it recombines these sites. So, if the Cre is active, the stop cassettes would be removed, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the experiment, when they crossed the mice with SOX10-Cre, which is a neural crest specific Cre, the eGFP (from the receptor) isn't showing up. So why isn't the eGFP being expressed?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells, I think. Because the construct is in the same cell, so if the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, it's autocrine. So maybe A isn't the issue here. They're looking for expression in the same cells, so if it's paracrine, the proteins might not be expressed in the same cell, but here the issue is expression in the cells where Cre is active.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. That would mean the eGFP isn't expressed on the surface, but they're looking for fluorescence. If the construct isn't properly trafficked, maybe no signal. But the question says the vector uses the correct signals. Alternatively, if the stop cassette wasn't removed, the receptor might not be expressed at all. So maybe B is possible, but why would the stop cassette not be removed?

Option C: Missing enhancer. CBA is a strong promoter. If the ligand is under CBA, maybe the promoter is sufficient. The receptor is under IRES. Wait, IRES doesn't need a promoter? Or does it? I think IRES allows for internal initiation, so the receptor's expression depends on the upstream CBA promoter. If there's no enhancer, maybe the expression isn't happening. But the vector has CBA, which is a constitutive promoter. So perhaps C isn't the issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh! If the ORF for the receptor isn't in frame with eGFP, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by eGFP, but also a stop cassette. So if the lox2272 stop isn't correctly recombined, the receptor might not be expressed, and the eGFP would be expressed in frame? Or maybe the other way around. Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF first, then a stop, then the receptor, then another stop. The stop is flanked by loxP and lox2272. When Cre is
