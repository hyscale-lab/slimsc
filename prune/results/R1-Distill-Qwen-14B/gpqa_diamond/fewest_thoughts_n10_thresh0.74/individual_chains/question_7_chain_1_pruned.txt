Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I need to find out at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, I remember that when particles annihilate, their energy needs to be sufficient to produce the products. So in this case, gamma-rays and CMB photons annihilate into electron-positron pairs. The key here is to find the energy threshold where this reaction becomes possible. 

The reaction is γγ → e+e-. For this to happen, the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of two electrons, since each has a mass of about 0.511 MeV. So two electrons would be about 1.022 MeV. But wait, the center-of-mass energy is calculated from the energies of the two photons. 

Since the CMB photons are at low energy (1e-3 eV), which is way lower than gamma-rays, the high-energy gamma-ray's energy is what we're concerned with. Let me think about how to calculate the required energy. 

The threshold condition for the reaction is when the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products. So, sqrt(s) = 2*m_e*c², which is approximately 1.022 MeV. 

The photons are moving in opposite directions since they're in a uniform background like the CMB. So, their energies are E_photon and E_gamma. But since the CMB is isotropic, the average photon energy is much lower. 

Wait, when two photons collide, their energies add up in the center-of-mass frame. But wait, no, the center-of-mass energy squared is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons have E = pc, and in opposite directions, their momenta cancel in the CM frame. So sqrt(s) = E1 + E2. 

Wait, so if photons are moving in opposite directions, then their energies add. So sqrt(s) = E1 + E2. But in our case, one is the high-energy gamma-ray (E_gamma) and the other is the CMB photon (
