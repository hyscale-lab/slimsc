Okay, so I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of product 4. Let's start by understanding each step of the reaction sequence to identify what product 4 is.

First, the initial reaction: acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Wait, I remember that acetic acid can undergo acetylation when treated with acetic anhydride in the presence of a base like pyridine. The acetylation typically occurs on the hydroxyl group. So, acetic acid has an -OH group which would get converted to an acetate group. But wait, another reagent is bromine. Hmm, that's confusing. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, bromine in the presence of a base like pyridine could lead to some kind of substitution or addition. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a bromination reaction. Maybe the acetic acid is being brominated. Wait, acetic acid has the structure CH3COOH. When treated with bromine and pyridine, maybe it's undergoing a substitution. Oh, wait, Pyridine is often used to absorb HBr in such reactions, like in the bromination of alcohols. So maybe the -OH is being replaced by Br.

Wait, but another possibility: I've heard that when acetic acid is treated with Br2 and pyridine, it can form bromoacetic acid. Because the OH is a good leaving group in such conditions. So product
