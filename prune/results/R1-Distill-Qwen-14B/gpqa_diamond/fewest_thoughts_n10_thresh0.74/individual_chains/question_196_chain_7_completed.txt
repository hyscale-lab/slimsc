Okay, so I need to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but I'll try to break it down.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The setup is a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. And the speed of light is c.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Oh, that's option C. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so maybe that doesn't apply here.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh right, so in special relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So we need to approach this using relativistic energy equations. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx² as in the classical case. Or is it still the same?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. The problem states it's a relativistic oscillator obeying Hooke's law. Hooke's law is F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², same as before. But when combining with relativistic effects, the kinetic energy isn't classical.

The total mechanical energy E is the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude. At the maximum amplitude A, the oscillator is momentarily at rest, so all energy is potential. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, no, because in the relativistic case, the total energy should account for the rest mass plus kinetic, but at maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is just the rest energy plus potential energy. But wait, potential energy in relativity? Or is that not the case?

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is (γ mc²) at any point, but that would be the case if the potential energy isn't considered. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's model it correctly. The system's total energy E is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy. At the maximum amplitude A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is it E = mc² + (1/2)kA²?

Wait, maybe not. Because mc² is the rest energy. In the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero—so E = mc² + U, where U is potential energy. U is (1/2)kA².

So E = mc² + (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the oscillator has maximum kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy equals E - mc², which is (1/2)kA².

So the kinetic energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, kinetic energy is (γ - 1) mc². So setting (γ - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Solve for γ.

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as some term, say, α. So α = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, γ = 1 + α.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root.

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

So,

(1 + α)^2 (1 - v²/c²) = 1.

Expanding,

(1 + 2α + α²)(1 - v²/c²) =1.

Hmm, but since α is (k A^2)/(2 m c²), if k A^2 is not much larger than m c², α could be small. But let's not assume that yet.

Wait, but perhaps I can make an approximation. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, when v is much less than c, α would be (k A^2)/(2 m c²), which is ( (k A^2)/(2 m) ) / c². But (k A^2)/(2m) is the classical expression for (1/2) m v_max², so let's see, v_max² = (k A^2)/(m). So (k A^2)/(2 m) = (1/2) m v_max² / m = (1/2) v_max². So in non-relativistic case, α = (1/2) v_max² / c². But since v_max is << c, α would be very small. So in that case, 1 + α ≈ 1, and 1/(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1 + v²/c². Hmm, but maybe that's not the way to go here.

Alternatively, let's solve for v².

Let me rewrite the earlier equation:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

Rearranged,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

Then,

v_max² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 ].

So,

v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 ).

Hmm, let me compute 1/(1 + α)^2.

Wait, let's compute 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

That is,

[(1 + α)^2 -1 ]/(1 + alpha)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v_max² = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2 ].

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c²). Let's substitute back.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ 2 alpha + alpha² ] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, but if alpha is small, perhaps we can approximate this.

Wait, but let's look at the options given.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Wait, wait, let me compare. From our earlier expression, v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2 ), which is same as option D.

Because option D is written as:

sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches our result.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option A has a square root of (1 + 1/(something squared)). That doesn't match. Option B has 1/(1 - ... ), which would be 1/(something) in the denominator inside the square root. No, our expression is 1 minus 1/(something squared), which is what D has.

So the maximum speed is given by option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy principles.

In the relativistic case, the total energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of its rest energy and potential energy at maximum amplitude \( A \). At \( x = A \), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. The potential energy is given by \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the total energy is:

\[
E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), the potential energy is zero, and the oscillator has maximum kinetic energy. In relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is expressed as:

\[
K = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. At maximum speed, the total energy equals the kinetic energy plus the rest energy:

\[
(\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we find:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v_{\text{max}} \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. The other options do not align with the derived expression. For example:

- Option A incorrectly adds terms under the square root.
- Option B has an incorrect denominator structure.
- Option C corresponds to the classical result, which does not account for relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
