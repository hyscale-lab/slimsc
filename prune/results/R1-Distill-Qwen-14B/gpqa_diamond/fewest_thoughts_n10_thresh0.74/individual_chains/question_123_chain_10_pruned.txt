Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the problem says that a supernova in our galaxy has some ejecta moving directly towards the center. Both the ejecta part and the galaxy are inertial frames of reference. So, from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame?

Wait, okay, so I need to find the distance the ejecta travels according to the galaxy's perspective, given time in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation or length contraction. Since the frames are moving relative to each other, I guess we'll need to use the Lorentz transformations or something like that.

Let me recall. In special relativity, when two frames are moving relative to each other, time and space measurements differ. The key here is that the time elapsed in one frame is different from the other. So, if 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (let's call this frame S'), how much time passes in the galaxy's frame (frame S)? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, wait. The ejecta's frame and the galaxy's frame are moving at a high speed relative to each other. The problem gives the velocity as 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that into units I'm more comfortable with. 60,000 km/s is 60,000,000 meters per second. But wait, the speed of light is approximately 3x10^8 m/s, which is 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 20% the speed of light (since 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2). So beta (β) is 0.2, and gamma (γ) is 1/sqrt(1 - β²).

Let me calculate gamma. β is 0.2. So β²
