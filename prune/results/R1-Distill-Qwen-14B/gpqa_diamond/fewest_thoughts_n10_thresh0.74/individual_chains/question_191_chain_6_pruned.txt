Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the product looks like after a series of reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. So, cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone group at position 1). At position 3 is a hydroxymethyl group, which is like -CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Hydroxymethyl is -CH2OH. Oh wait, actually, 3-(hydroxymethyl) would be a CH2OH group attached to carbon 3 of the cyclohexane ring. Then, at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is the same as isopropenyl. So that's a CH2-C(CH2) group attached. So, the structure is a cyclohexanone ring with CH2OH at C3 and an isopropenyl group at C5.

Reaction 1: Treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, typically used as a base in alkylation reactions. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So, probably an SN2 reaction. But wait, where's the nucleophile here? The starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH) at C3. When NaH is added, it's a strong base, so it would deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, the benzyl bromide would react with that alkoxide. So, the oxygen at C3 would attack the benzyl bromide, replacing the bromide. So, the product would have a benzyl group attached to the CH2O- group. So, that would substitute the OH with O-benzyl. So, the hydroxymethyl group becomes a benzyl-protected group, like O-benzyl. So, product 1 would be 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-isopropenylcyclohexan-1-one. Wait, or more accurately, 3-(benzyloxy)methylcyclohexanone. Let me make sure: the original structure has a CH2OH. After alkylation, it becomes CH2-O-Bn (Bn is benzyl). So, that's the first step.

Reaction 2: Product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in presence of catalytic HCl, forming product 2.

I remember that p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) hydrazide is used in the von Braun degradation or in the formation of a hydrazone. Wait, when a ketone is treated with hydrazine derivatives, it forms a hydrazone. So, the ketone (cyclohexanone) in product 1 would react with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. The presence of HCl probably helps in protonating the carbonyl, making it more reactive.

So, the ketone group (at position 1) would form a hydrazone. The product would be a hydrazide. So, the cyclohexanone becomes a hydrazide at that position. So, the structure would be 1-(3-(benzyloxy)methyl-5-isopropenylcyclohexyl)-p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. So, product 2 is the hydrazone of the ketone.

Reaction 3: Product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium at low temperature, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride, forming product 3.

n-BuLi is a strong base, used for deprotonation. But wait, after forming a hydrazone, what's next? Oh, wait, when a ketone is converted into a hydrazone, and then treated with a strong base like BuLi, it can lead to the formation of an enolate. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrazone has a certain group that can be deprotonated.

Wait, another approach: The hydrazone is a good leaving group. When treated with a base, perhaps it can undergo a cyclization or elimination. Alternatively, maybe this is a case of the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but Wolff-Kishner usually uses a hydrazine and strong base (like KOH or NH2NH2) under high heat to eliminate the carbonyl group, forming an amine. Wait, but in this case, it's a hydrazone, so maybe it's similar.

Wait, another thought: When the hydrazone is treated with a strong base, maybe it forms an enolate. Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrazone is being deprotonated somewhere, leading to a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Wait, considering the structure of product 2: it's a hydrazone attached to the cyclohexane ring. The ring has a benzyl group at C3 and an isopropenyl at C5. The hydrazone is at position 1. So, the structure is R-Câ‰¡N-N-R', where R is the cyclohexyl group and R' is the p-toluenesulfonyl group.

When BuLi is added, perhaps it deprotonates the compound. Where are the acidic protons? The hydrazine has NH groups which are acidic. The p-toluenesulfonyl group is a good leaving group. So, when BuLi deprotonates, it could form a strong base. Maybe the hydrazone is deprotonated, and then undergoes some elimination.

Wait, another possibility: The hydrazone group can be considered as a good leaving group if the base abstracts a proton. Alternatively, perhaps the Li from BuLi can attack the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but in a hydrazone, the carbonyl is converted into a C=N-NR2 group. So the C=N is part of the structure. Maybe the reaction is leading to a ring expansion or some kind of annulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrazone group is converted into an amine. Because when you have a hydrazone and you treat it with a strong base, sometimes it can undergo elimination. Wait, but in the presence of BuLi, perhaps the hydrazone is undergoing some kind of deproton
