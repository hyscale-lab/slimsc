Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of the listed stars meet the S/N ratio requirement of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

First, let me recall what I know about ESPRESSO. I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's known for its high efficiency and precision, especially in detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method. But I'm not exactly sure about its specific detection limits.

The question gives me six stars (a to f) with varying properties. I need to determine for each whether the S/N is at least 10. The key here is understanding how the S/N depends on factors like the star's brightness (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, and the instrument's capabilities.

Wait, S/N ratio in spectroscopy generally depends on the number of photons detected. So, the brighter the star (lower magnitude), the higher the S/N. The formula for S/N is something like S/N = (N_photons) / (sqrt(N_photons)), which simplifies to sqrt(N_photons). So if I can calculate the number of photons from each star, I can estimate the S/N.

ESPRESSO's performance is probably characterized by its collecting area, efficiency, and the exposure time. The VLT has 8m telescopes, which have a certain collecting area. I think the effective area of an 8m telescope is about 60 m² (since area is πr², r=4m, so π*4²=50.27, but maybe approximated as 60 considering the mirror's reflectivity and other factors).

The formula for the number of photons (N) received by the telescope from a star is given by:

N = (L * t * ε) / (4π d²) * A * Q * R,

But maybe it's easier to use the relation between apparent magnitude and photon flux. The apparent magnitude (m) of a star tells us how bright it appears from Earth. The V magnitude scale is such that a difference of 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in brightness.

Wait, but perhaps a more straightforward approach is to relate the S/N to the star's apparent magnitude. ESPRESSO's S/N per pixel depends on the star's brightness. I think ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N ratio of about 100 per pixel for bright stars (like those with V magnitudes around 10) in an hour. But how does that scale with magnitude?

I remember that each magnitude step (5 magnitudes) corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness. So each magnitude step is a factor of approximately 2.512 in brightness. The S/N scales with the square root of the number of photons, which is proportional to the brightness. So for each step in magnitude, the S/N changes by a factor of sqrt(2.512), which is about 1.58.

So if a star of magnitude m gives S/N S, then a
