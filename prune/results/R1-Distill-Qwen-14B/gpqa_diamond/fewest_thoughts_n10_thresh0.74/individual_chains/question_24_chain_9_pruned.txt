Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again and make sure I understand all the parts.

The problem is about a mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28% and is a solvent. Also, X's compounds don't have conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out what's going on here. So, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually means it has double bonds because alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine. But since it's a mixture of two liquids, perhaps they are alkenes or something similar.

When treated with Pt and heated, X undergoes a reaction to become Y. The result is a disproportionation reaction, meaning one of the substances is both oxidized and reduced. Since Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, the products have no double bonds or perhaps are saturated.

When X and Y are hydrogenated, they both give the same hydrocarbon Z. So Z must be an alkane because it's fully hydrogenated. Let's calculate Z's formula first.

Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. Let's convert that to a molar fraction. Mass fraction is (mass of H)/(molar mass) * 100%. Let's call the molecular formula of Z CnH2m. Wait, no, wait. Hydrocarbons can be alkanes, alkenes, etc. But since Z is formed by hydrogenation and doesn't react further, it must be an alkane, so formula would be CnH2n+2.

Wait, but let me double-check. If Z is an alkane, then yes, it's CnH2n+2. Let's compute the mass fraction. The mass of H in Z is (2n+2)*1 g/mol divided by the molar mass (12n + 2n +2) = 14n +2.

So (2n+2) / (14n + 2) = 14.28% = 0.1428.

Let me write that as an equation:

(2n+2)/(14n + 2) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by (14n + 2):

2n+2 = 0.1428*(14n +2).

Compute 0.1428 *14n = 2n, because 14 * 0.1428 is approx 2 (14 * 0.1428 = 1.9992, which is nearly 2). And 0.1428 *2 is approximately 0.2856.

So the equation becomes:

2n +2 = 2n + 0.2856.

Wait wait, that can't be
