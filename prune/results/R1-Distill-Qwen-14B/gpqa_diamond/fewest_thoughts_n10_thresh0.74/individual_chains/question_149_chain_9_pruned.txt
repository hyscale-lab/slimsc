Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try my best.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, each is about half, maybe. But when looking at coupling patterns, it's ruled out that this is spin-spin coupling. Hmm, why would that be?

Wait, spin-spin coupling would usually cause splitting into multiple peaks, like a triplet or something, depending on the neighboring protons. But the question says they've ruled that out. So the two peaks aren't due to coupling with adjacent protons. Maybe they're due to some other effect, like splitting from something else or perhaps something in the structure causing it.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, and the MS is consistent with the expected molecule. So, same molecular weight, same everything. But two peaks. So, possibly two isomers with the same molecular weight?

Hmm, so the options are A to D. Let's go through each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. A precursor would be a larger molecule, maybe the starting material before some reaction. But the LC-MS shows same mass as expected. So that's probably not it. Because a precursor would have a higher mass.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. In NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, the peaks would be the same because the environment is achiral. Unless the instrument is chiral, which it isn't. Wait, wait. Wait, in NMR, if you have enantiomers, you wouldn't see different peaks because the environment is the same. Unless you have some diastereotopicity or something else. Oh, wait, but if the environment is not chiral, then the NMR wouldn't show splitting between enantiomers. So the NMR would appear as a single peak. But in the question, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So maybe this isn't the case. Unless there's some other effect. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide formation. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' refers to. Maybe like two coupling events or something during the reaction? Or perhaps some kind of coupling that leads to two peaks. But I'm not really familiar with this term. Maybe during the formation of an amide bond, like if a side reaction occurs where another bond forms, causing some diastereomers or something?

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, including different NMR shifts. But if the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment, then their peaks would be close but maybe split into two. Wait, but in the NMR, theyâ€™re seeing two peaks for the same proton. So, if the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, that could cause two separate peaks for the same proton
