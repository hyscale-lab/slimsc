Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. The question involves exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and orbital periods. Oh right, they found these using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure how that affects this problem, maybe it's just context.

Alright, the question says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4. Then the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so T2/T3 = 2.3. So, let me write that down:

T1/T2 = 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 T2
T2/T3 = 2.3 → T3 = T2 / 2.3

So combining these, T1 = 1.4 * T2 = 1.4 * (2.3 * T3) = 3.22 T3. So the ratio T1/T3 is about 3.22. Or wait, maybe I should compute T1 over T3. Let me think: T1 is 1.4 times T2, and T3 is T2 divided by 2.3. So T1 = 1.4 * T2, and T3 = T2 / 2.3. So T1 / T3 = [1.4 * T2] / [T2/2.3] = 1.4 * 2.3 = 3.22. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3.

But equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star, right? The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )^(1/2), wait no, let me recall the formula. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = Tstar * sqrt(Rstar/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature scales with ( (L / (16πσ a² (1 - a)) ) )^(1/4), but L is the star's luminosity, and a is the planet's orbital semi-major axis. Alternatively, since L is proportional to R_star^2 * T_star^4 (from the Stefan-Boltzmann law), we can substitute that in. So, the equilibrium temperature for a planet is:

Te = Tstar * sqrt( Rstar / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25.

Wait, but in this problem, the albedo is the same for all three planets, 0.3, so (1 - albedo) is 0.7 for all. So that factor remains the same for each planet. Therefore, when comparing the equilibrium temperatures of the planets, the albedo cancels out because it's the same for all. So we can just consider the other factors.

Therefore, the ratio of Te between two planets can
