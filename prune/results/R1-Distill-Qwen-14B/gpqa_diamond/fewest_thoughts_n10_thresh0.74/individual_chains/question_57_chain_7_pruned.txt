Okay, so I have this physics problem about scattering of electrons, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question says.

The problem gives me phase shifts for an elastic scattering experiment with 50 MeV electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are δ0 = 90 degrees, δ1 = 67 degrees, δ2 = 55 degrees, δ3 = 30 degrees, and δ4 = 13 degrees. They tell me to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. The main goal is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. And then choose the correct option from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts. For each angular momentum l, the phase shift δ_l contributes to the amplitude. The formula I think is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ ( (2l +1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l + lθ) ), where k is the wave number.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction would be θ=0 degrees, the forward direction. So I need to evaluate the imaginary part of f(0).

Wait, or wait, no. Let me think. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is a complex quantity. The imaginary part of f(θ) is related to the differential cross-section. But the problem says, calculate the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. So θ is 0 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. The incident beam direction would correspond to θ=0 in the scattering angle. But wait, in the context of scattering, the initial direction is often considered as θ=0, but when the electron is scattered, θ is the angle from the original direction. So when θ=0, the electron goes straight through without scattering.

But more importantly, I think the key formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part comes from the phase shifts.

I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude
