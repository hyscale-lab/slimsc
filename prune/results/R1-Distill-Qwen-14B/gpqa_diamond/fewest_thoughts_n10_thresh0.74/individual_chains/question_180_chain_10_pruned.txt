Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about gravitational interactions or anything like that. Oh wait, right, because electric interactions are what's happening here.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I think that means point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other twelve are arranged around it at a distance of 2 meters each. So imagine a sphere with twelve charges equally spaced on the surface, each 2m away from the center where the 13th charge is.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, energy in an electric system usually refers to the electric potential energy. So I need to calculate the total electric potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics. Right, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. And since the system is isolated, we're probably considering the potential energy of each pair of charges.

But wait, when multiple charges are involved, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Because each charge interacts with every other charge. Oh, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, so it's part of all interactions except with the other twelve charges on the sphere? Or no, wait, all the charges except the 13th are identical and at 2m from P.

Wait no, the 13th is at P, and the other twelve are at 2m from P. But are the other twelve spaced in such a way that each is 2m from P but perhaps a different distance from each other? Hmm, that might complicate things. Wait, but the problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but doesn't specify their arrangement among themselves. If it's an isolated system, probably the charges arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy, which would typically be in a symmetric configuration. So maybe the twelve are equally spaced on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m around P. So each of the twelve
