Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused about where to start, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and that these complexes can affect the concentration of the free ions in solution.

The problem gives me that the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is a standard condition, so maybe I don't need to worry about temperature affecting the K value. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10, which is a pretty large number. I remember that a large K means the reaction favors the product, so the complex is stable.

So the reaction I'm thinking of is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10. Now, I'm trying to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in the solution. I think this involves the concept of the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The K expression for this would be K = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. Since the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, I can let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M. But wait, when it dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-.

So, let me set up an ICE table in my mind. Initially, the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are zero. Then, when it dissociates, let's say it dissociates by x amount. So, the change would be: [Ca²+] increases by x, [EDTA] increases by x, and [Complex] decreases by x, becoming (0.02 - x).

Wait, but wait a second. Since the K is so large (5e10), the dissociation of the complex must be very small. Because K is very big, the denominator [Complex] is going to be approximately 0.02, and the numerator [Ca²+][EDTA] would be
