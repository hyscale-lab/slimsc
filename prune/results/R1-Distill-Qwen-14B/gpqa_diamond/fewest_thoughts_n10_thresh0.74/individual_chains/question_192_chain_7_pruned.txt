Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the setup is a bit complicated, but I'll take it slow.

So the question is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, where r is less than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. We're supposed to find the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and l is the distance from the center of the cavity to point P. Also, l and L are both greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside. The angle between l and s is theta. 

The options are four expressions for E, each involving different distances squared in the denominator. I remember that for conductors, the charges redistribute in certain ways, but since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think the induced charges will be important here.

Wait, since the conductor is uncharged, but it has a cavity with a charge inside, what happens? Oh right, when a conductor encloses a charge, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced charge opposite to the enclosed charge. But since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface would have no charge. So in this case, the cavity has +q, so the inner surface of the conductor must have -q. And since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface would have +q?

Wait, no. Wait. Let me think. The conductor is initially neutral. Inside the cavity, there's a charge +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have an induced charge of -q because the conductor's material will redistribute to cancel the field inside the conductor. So the cavity's inner surface has -q. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q, because the total charge of the conductor is zero, and the inner is -q, so the outer is +q.

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor's total charge is zero. The inner surface has -q because of the enclosed +q. So the remaining charge on the conductor is +q on the outer surface. Because all the conductor's charge is on the outer surface,
