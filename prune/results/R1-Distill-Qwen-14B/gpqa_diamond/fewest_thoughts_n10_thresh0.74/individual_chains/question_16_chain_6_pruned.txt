Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D, with the answers ranging from 2 to 5. 

First, I remember that a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning they have four different substituents. Alternatively, it could have a plane of symmetry or be a meso compound, which would mean it's not chiral. So the key is to check each compound for these conditions.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-Cl? Wait, but wait, the numbering is 1-chloro, so maybe it's Cl attached to the first carbon of the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2. The configuration is Z, which refers to the geometry around the double bond. For a compound to be chiral, it needs a chiral center, but does this structure have any?

   The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Let me draw that. The structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another substituent. Wait, the molecule is CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)-? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, it's CH2Cl connected to a double bond, but wait, the double bond is at but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

   Wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. The 1-chloro substituent is on the first carbon. So it's ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be replacing one H on C1. So it's ClCH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and
