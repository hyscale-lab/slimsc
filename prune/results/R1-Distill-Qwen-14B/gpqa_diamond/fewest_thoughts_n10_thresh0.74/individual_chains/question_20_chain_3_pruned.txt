Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics and the impulse approximation. Hmm, let me think. I remember that in nuclear physics, when dealing with many-body systems, approximations are often made to simplify calculations. The question is asking which assumptions lead to the impulse approximation where nucleons behave like free particles.

The question lists four assumptions, and I have to pick which combination of three are correct. Let me go through each assumption one by one.

Assumption 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. So, if the current only deals with each nucleon separately, that makes sense for an approximation where each nucleon is treated as if it's free. Because in reality, they're all interacting with each other, but if the interaction is considered only pairwise or individually, maybe we can treat them as free.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what does transparent mean here? I think it refers to the idea that other nucleons don't affect the interaction. So, when a nucleon interacts with something, the others just pass through without influencing it. That would mean each nucleon is only interacting with the external force, not with the rest of the nucleus. So this would imply that the nucleon behaves as if it's free because the others don't interfere.

Assumption 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, so quarks are non-relativistic. Wait, non-relativistic implies that their kinetic energies are much less than their rest mass energy, so we can use non-relativistic mechanics to describe them. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? Well, maybe if the quarks are non-relativistic, the nucleon itself isn't moving at speeds where relativistic effects are significant, so it's treated in a simpler way. But does that contribute to the overall approximation where the nucleon is free? I'm not so sure. I thought the impulse approximation more deals with the external interactions rather than the internal structure of the nucleon.

Assumption 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, that makes sense. If the nucleon is not experiencing binding forces from the nucleus, then it's like it's free. Because in reality, the binding forces (like the strong nuclear force) hold the nucleons together, but if we ignore that, each nucleon acts as if it's free.

So putting it together, the impulse approximation assumes that when a nucleon interacts (like via an electroweak force), it does so without being influenced by the other nucleons. So the other nucleons don't affect the interaction (assumption 1), the nucleus doesn't block or affect the interaction except for the target nucleon (assumption 2), and the nucleon itself isn't bound during the interaction (assumption 4).

Wait, what about assumption 3? I'm wondering if the quarks being non-relativistic is part of this. Because if the internal structure is non-relativistic, perhaps it's part of treating the nucleon as a point particle, but I'm not sure if that's part of the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation is more about the external interactions and the treatment of the
