Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² π² ħ²) / (2mL²), right? They mention that E is given as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, these are four identical particles. Oh right, identical particles are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions, each must occupy a unique quantum state. So no two can have the same set of quantum numbers.

In a 1D infinite well, the quantum state of a particle is determined by the principal quantum number n. So each particle must have a different n.

Wait, but each particle is spin-1/2, so each can have two possible spin states: up or down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins.

Ah, right. So with four particles, the maximum number you can have in each n is two, since each can have a spin up or down.

But wait, the particles are identical fermions, so each must have a unique combination of quantum numbers. That includes both the spatial part (n) and the spin part. So for each n, you can have two particles: one with spin up and one with spin down. So for each energy level n, you can have two particles.

But since we have four particles, we'll need to fill up the lowest energy levels, each taking two particles.

So let's think about how the particles fill the states.

Ground state: the lowest energy configuration. For four particles, you'll fill the lowest possible n's, each with two particles (since each n can hold two spins).

So the lowest n is 1. Two particles here, each with spin up and down. Then the next level, n=2, which can hold two more particles. That's four particles total.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait, wait. No, no, because
