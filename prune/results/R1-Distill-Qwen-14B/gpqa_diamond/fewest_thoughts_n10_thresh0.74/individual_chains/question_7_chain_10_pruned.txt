Okay, so I have this physics problem about the annihilation of gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking at what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by the process where they annihilate with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The reaction is γγ → e+ e−. I remember that this process is a way gamma-rays can lose energy or even disappear, depending on the photon density.

I think the key here is to find the energy where the mean free time for this annihilation becomes comparable to the age of the universe or something like that. Because if the gamma-ray's lifetime is shorter due to this process, their energy would be limited beyond which they can't exist anymore.

Wait, but how does the energy of the gamma relate to the CMB photon? Oh right, the CMB has an average photon energy of 1e-3 eV. So each CMB photon is about that energy. And the gamma is high energy, so its energy E is much higher than that.

I remember that for pair production by gamma-CMB interaction, the cross-section depends on the product of the photon energies. The process is only significant when the combined energy is enough to produce the rest mass of an electron-positron pair. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, I think.

Wait, so the threshold energy for this reaction is when the sum of the two photons' energies is equal to twice the electron mass. So E_gamma * E_CMB ≈ (m_e c²)^2, but wait, no, the condition is E1 + E2 >= 2 m_e c². But since the CMB photon is much lower energy than the gamma, in the center of mass frame, I might need to think about it in terms of invariant quantities.

Alternatively, since the CMB is isotropic and the gamma is moving through it, maybe the effective photon energy in the gamma's rest frame is important. Because in the gamma's rest frame, the CMB photon appears blueshifted. So the product of the photon energies in the lab frame (gamma moving) would have to be such that when viewed in the gamma's frame, their energies sum to more than 2 m_e c².

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the product of the gamma's energy and the CMB photon's energy is on the order of (m_e c²)^2. Because in the center of mass frame, the sum of the energies must be at least twice the electron mass.

Wait, but the CMB photon energy is given as E_CMB = 1e-3 eV. So E_gamma * E_CMB ≈ (m_e c²)^2.

So E_gamma ≈ (m_e c²)^2 / E_CMB.

Let's calculate that. m_e c^2 is about 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV. So (511,000 eV)^2 is (5.11e5 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

Divide by E_CMB, which is 1e-3 eV. So 2.61e11 / 1e
