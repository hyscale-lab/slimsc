Okay, so I've got this question about polymer chemistry, specifically ethylene polymerization and catalyst systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The scenario is a scientist using a homogeneous organometallic catalyst to make a high-density polymer. He wants to add a second catalyst to introduce regular branches. So the goal is to form a polymer with branches, using only ethylene as the monomer, and a dual catalyst system.

The senior scientist gives four statements, and I need to figure out which are correct. The options are A to D, each a statement from the senior.

Wait, the question says that the scientist uses ethylene as the only reactant. So it's about ethylene polymerizationâ€”probably polyethylene. High density suggests linear low-density polyethylene? Wait, no, high density usually means low branching. Wait, no, high density polyethylene (HDPE) is more linear, less branched than LDPE (which is more branched and lower density). So the initial polymer is probably HDPE, made with a catalyst that gives a linear structure.

Now, the scientist wants to add a second catalyst to introduce regular branches. So the process is going from linear to branched. Like, maybe a metallocene catalyst or something else. Oh wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me recall: Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used for HDPE and LDPE. They are typically TiCl4 with an organoaluminum co-catalyst. But for branching, maybe a different type of catalyst is used. Oh, wait, for producing polymers with controlled branching, like in some grades of polyethylene, they might use a dual catalyst system. 

So the senior says: 

1. "Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US." So option B is statement B.

2. "One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators." Group VIa is the same as group 6 (like Cr, Mo, W). So maybe a molybdenum or tungsten-based catalyst. I think some catalysts for branching might be from group VI, but I'm not entirely sure.

3. "Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step." Wait, because in Ziegler-Natta, the activator is often an organoaluminum compound. So if the second catalyst
