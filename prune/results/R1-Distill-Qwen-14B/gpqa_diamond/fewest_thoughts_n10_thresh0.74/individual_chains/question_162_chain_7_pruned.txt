Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and calculating the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm. Let's try to think this through step by step.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I'm trying to remember what a pseudosphere is. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a hyperbolic surface, right? But wait, how does this metric relate to that?

I remember that the metric for a surface can tell us about its curvature. For a 2D space, the metric is in terms of dx and dy. The general form for a 2D metric might look like ds² = f(r)² (dr² + dθ²) for polar coordinates, but this one is in terms of x and y.

Wait, this metric is written in Cartesian coordinates. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. Let me see, so the coefficient in front of dx² and dy² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). That's interesting because the denominator could be zero when 4 - x² - y² = 0, so at x² + y² =4, which is a circle of radius 2. So the metric blows up there. That makes me think that the surface has a boundary at x² + y² =4, which might be the edge of the pseudosphere.

But wait, what's the
