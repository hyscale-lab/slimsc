Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So I know that |up> and |down> are orthonormal basis states, probably spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The task is to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator. The operator's matrix representation has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, that would look like:

A = [ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. So for A_ij: when i != j, A_ij = hbar/2, else zero. So in a 2x2 system, the matrix would have zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. Hmm.

I remember that this kind of matrix is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if we multiply by hbar/2, it's [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So yeah, this operator A is (hbar/2) times σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So the eigenstates of A would be the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, because A is just a scalar multiple of σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(+1) = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)(-1) = -hbar/2.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator A. So we need to find the probabilities of the system being in each eigenstate of A when measured.

Wait, but the state |alpha> is given in the z-basis (|up> and |down>). So if we can express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, then the square of the coefficients would give the probabilities.

Alternatively, another approach is to find the eigenstates of A and then compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate. The square modulus of those inner products would give the probabilities.

So the first step is to find the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, its eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So the eigenstates of A would be these, scaled by hbar/2.

Wait, no, the eigenstates are the same regardless of the scalar multiple. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)}. These are the eigenstates with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

So now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let's find the normalization factor first. Because the state must be normalized, the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients must be 1.

The coefficient for |up> is (1+i), whose magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. The coefficient for |down
