Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. That's why, for instance, you can't have a magnet with just a single pole sticking out. This is related to one of Maxwell's equations.

Wait, Maxwell's equations include four laws. Let me think about each one. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity, which deals with electric flux and charge. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. Oh right, because there are no isolated magnetic charges in our universe—so that equation would be different if such charges existed.

The third equation is Faraday's Law of induction, which is about the curl of the electric field and changing magnetic fields. The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, dealing with the curl of the magnetic field and currents plus displacement current.

So the question is, in a universe where magnets can have isolated poles, which equations would change? Well, if there were isolated magnetic monopoles, that would mean that the total magnetic charge density exists. In such a case, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because in the regular equation, divergence of B equals zero, representing no magnetic monopoles. If monopoles exist, that equation would change.

Which equation is that? Oh yeah, it's Gauss's Law for magnetism, which is the second of Maxwell's equations. So that equation would definitely be different. Are there any others? Let me think about what else would be affected.

Wait, another thought: Maxwell's equations also include the concept of displacement current, but that's more about the time-varying electric fields. If magnetic monopoles exist, would that affect Faraday's Law? Faraday's Law involves the curl of E related to the negative rate of change of B. I don't think that would change because it's about how magnetic fields change creating electric fields. So Faraday's Law probably remains the same.

What about Ampère's Law? Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the current density plus displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect the curl of B? Well, Ampère's Law is about how the magnetic field circulates around currents. If there are magnetic charges, perhaps there's also a current associated with them. But I'm not sure if that directly modifies Ampère's equation as it's currently formulated. Wait, no, Ampère's Law is about the sources of the magnetic field, which are currents. The current would still be the same unless magnetic monopoles contribute to current as well. Hmm, but I think the question is about which Maxwell equation changes. Since Gauss's Law for magnetism is the key one that changes, that's the main point.

So, looking at the options, the question is which equations are different. The second Maxwell equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, would be different because it would have a non-zero divergence of B. Are any others changed?

Wait, another thought: The existence of magnetic monopoles would imply an equation similar to Gauss's Law for electricity but for magnetism. So perhaps the divergence of B equals the magnetic charge density. So that equation definitely changes. Are
