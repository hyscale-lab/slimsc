Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, there's a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems. Each has a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, and when they measured the positions, the particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a'.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. Since no particles were found outside x=1 and x=3, that must mean the wave function is zero outside that region. So, the wave function must be zero for x < 1 and x > 3.

Wait, but the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So, for it to be zero when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the expression must be zero in those regions.

Let me think. The wave function is a function of x. So, maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So when x is less than 1 or greater than 3, the wave function is zero.

But the given expression is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, maybe that's the general form, but outside x=1 and x=3, the wave function should be zero. So perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, and the given form is only between 1 and 3.

Wait, but the problem says that the wave function is as given in the part of space where the particle can exist. Oh, wait, the part where it can exist is between x=1 and x=3 because when they measured, particles were only found there. So, the wave function is zero outside, and the given expression is the form within that interval.

So, the wave function is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition, right? The integral of |Ïˆ|^2 dx from -infinity to infinity should equal 1.

So, I need to integrate the square of the modulus of this wave function between x=1 and x=3, and set it
