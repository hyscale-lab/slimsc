Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. The goal is to find out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. The options are A) 14, B) 10, C) 12, D) 11.

First, I'll try to break down each step of the reaction.

Starting material: trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring connected to a propenal group. Wait, more accurately, it's phenyl group attached to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Cinnamaldehyde is actually benzaldehyde with a vinyl group attached. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. No, wait a second. Cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No. Wait, perhaps I should visualize it better. Cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached. The structure is benzaldehyde with a double bond. So, it's Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal, which means it's an aldehyde with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3, and a phenyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is: O=CH-CH₂-Ph? No, wait. Wait, prop-2-enal would be CH₂
