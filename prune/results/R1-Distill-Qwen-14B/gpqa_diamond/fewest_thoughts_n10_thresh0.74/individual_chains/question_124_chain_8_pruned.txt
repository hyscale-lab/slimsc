Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure it out. So the question is about particles being collided in a detector, right? And these particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reaches the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But since these are ultra-relativistic, v is very close to c, so gamma is large. 

The key here is probably the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls. Because if they decay quickly, only some of them will make it. So the problem must be related to their lifetime as observed in the lab frame versus the proper frame.

Oh, right! Time dilation. From the lab's perspective, the particles' lifetime is gamma times their proper lifetime. So the decay length would be gamma multiplied by c multiplied by the proper lifetime. 

Wait, the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So if a particle's lifetime is tau in its rest frame, then in the lab frame, it's gamma tau. So the distance it travels is v * gamma tau. But since v is approximately c, it's approximately c * gamma tau.

So the decay length L is approximately c * gamma tau. 

Now, in the first scenario, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the walls. That means that the decay length L must be equal to the radius of the detector, right? Because if the average decay length is equal to the radius, then on average, particles have a 50-50 chance of decaying before reaching the wall. But wait, actually, the fraction that makes it depends on the relation between L and the detector radius.

Wait, no. Think again. The decay is a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a certain distance depends on the decay length. The probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall is e^(-R/(L)), where R is the distance to the wall. Wait, no, let me think. The decay probability is exponential. So the survival probability is exp(-R/L). Because R is the distance to the detector wall. So if the particles are produced at the center, then R is the radius, 30 meters.

So in the first case, when gamma is 20, one third of the particles reach the wall. That means the survival probability is 1/3 when gamma is 20. So:

1/3 = exp(-R/(L)) = exp(-R/(c gamma tau)).

Wait, because L is c gamma tau. So R/(L) is R/(c gamma tau). But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the decay length L = gamma c tau. So R is the detector radius, 30 m. The survival probability is exp(-R/(L)) = exp(- R/(gamma c tau)).

Wait,
