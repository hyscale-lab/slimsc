Okay, so I've got this problem about a vector field and calculating the volume integral of its divergence inside a sphere. Hmm, I remember from my vector calculus class that divergence is related to how a field spreads out or converges. Let me think.

The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r² radially. So, in spherical coordinates, it only has a radial component. That probably means that the vector field is pointing directly away from or towards the origin. Since it's along the radial direction, I guess its components in theta and phi (the angular directions) are zero.

Wait, the problem says it's a vector field, so it's a function that assigns a vector to each point in space. The magnitude is 1/r², and it's only radial. So maybe the vector field f(r) can be written as f(r) er / r², where er is the radial unit vector.

Now, I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV. Hmm, I remember that there's a theorem related to this, maybe Gauss's theorem or the divergence theorem. Oh right, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to go that way. Alternatively, I can compute the divergence directly and then integrate.

Let me compute ∇ · f. Since the field is purely radial, the divergence formula in spherical coordinates might be simpler. Oh right, in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field A is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) d/dφ A_φ. But since A_θ and A_φ are zero, the divergence simplifies.

So here, A_r is the radial component, which is f(r) = 1/r². So,

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) + 0 + 0.

Simplify that. Let's compute d/dr of (r² * 1/r²) which is d/dr (1) = 0. So wait, the divergence is zero?

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere inside, except maybe at the origin, but wait, the field is f(r) = er / r². Oh wait, actually, when r is zero, this field is not defined. So the divergence might have a delta function at the origin, but in the volume integral excluding the origin, it would
