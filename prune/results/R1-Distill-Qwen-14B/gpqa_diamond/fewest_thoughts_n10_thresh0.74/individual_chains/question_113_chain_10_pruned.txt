Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about identifying an unknown compound using spectroscopic data. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all based on C6H something O. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the FTIR data: a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the presence of a broad peak can also be due to hydrogen bonding, which is more typical in carboxylic acids or maybe an acid derivative. But wait, let me not jump to conclusions yet.

Then, the FTIR also shows strong absorption at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which probably indicates a carbonyl group. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated double bonds, maybe an aromatic ring with substituents). Or could it be an amide group? No, wait, amides typically absorb around 1650 and 1680. But let me think again. 1700 is a classic for a ketone or aldehyde or maybe an ester. But the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretch) or perhaps another carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, if there are two carbonyl peaks, that suggests maybe two different types of carbonyl groups. Like maybe a conjugated system. But wait, esters usually have a carbonyl around 1740, right? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl would be lower, like 1650. Oh! Maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyls. Or perhaps a conjugated ester or something.

Wait, but the 1700 might be an ester or a ketone. The 1650 could be conjugated with something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with C=C bonds. Because 1650 is in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl and an aromatic component.

Moving on to the 1H NMR: there are several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have a double bond, probably an alkene. So maybe the structure has both a carbonyl and an alkene.

Now, the Mass Spec: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass. Let me think. The mass 45 could correspond to several fragments. For example, a methyl group (15) and a CO group (28) might add up to 43, but that's not 45. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be an ethylene group or maybe a ketone fragment. Alternatively, think about common fragments
