Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH, giving a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. Then product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. Finally, we need to determine the coupling pattern in the 1H NMR of product 3, specifically for the most deshielded hydrogen that doesn't exchange with the solvent.

Hmm. Let's start with the first reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically an E2 mechanism, forming an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two bromines on adjacent carbons of the adamantane framework.

Wait, no, actually, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the bromines on carbons 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. Oh, but wait, in the adamantane structure, each carbon is connected to three others, right? So 1 and 3 would be two carbons apart? Or maybe they're adjacent in some way. Wait, I might need to visualize the structure. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure, with each carbon connected to three others. So the positions 1 and 3 would be across a face or something. Hmm, but regardless, when heated with KOH, probably an elimination occurs. But wait, if both Br are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if they're not adjacent, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane: perhaps each carbon has only one Br, and the two are not adjacent. So when KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but that would require adjacent leaving groups. Oh wait, but in this case, maybe it's a
