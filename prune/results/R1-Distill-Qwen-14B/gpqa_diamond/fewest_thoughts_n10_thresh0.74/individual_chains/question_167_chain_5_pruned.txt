Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. The relative entropy method compares the given state to a reference Gaussian state. The formula given is del_b, which is the difference between the entropy of the state rho and the reference state tau.

The state is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. I know that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, which are Gaussian states. But the superposition of two coherent states usually creates a non-Gaussian state, like a Schrödinger cat state.

The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). Let me plug in the values: phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5.

Wait, let's compute sin(2phi) first. Phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2). Let's calculate that exponent: 2*(0.25) is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is about 1/sqrt(e) which is approximately 0.6065.

So N^2 = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. Taking the square root, N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

But wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute exp(-2*(0.5)^2) again. 0.5^2 is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.60653066.

So N = sqrt(1 - 0.60653066) = sqrt(0.39346934). Let me compute that: sqrt(0.393469) ≈ 0.62745.

So the state |psi> is normalized by this N. Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The reference state tau is a Gaussian state. But what kind? I think for the relative entropy, the reference Gaussian state is often the thermal state or maybe the closest Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, sometimes it's the vacuum or a coherent state. Wait, but the problem says "the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state." So perhaps tau is the state that is the closest Gaussian to rho, minimizing the relative entropy? Or maybe it's the state that has the same first and second moments as rho. Because for Gaussian states, the density matrix is determined by the first and second moments.

Wait, but in this case, rho is a superposition of two coherent states, so its first moments (like the mean photon number) might be somewhere between the two. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because for Gaussian states, the second moments (like variance) determine the state uniquely.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one which is the "closest" to rho in some sense, perhaps the one that minimizes the relative entropy. But I'm not entirely certain. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the properties of the state. The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Given that phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4
