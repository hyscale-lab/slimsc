Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me try to break it down.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where ε is an energy constant, σ is the Pauli vector (I think that's what they mean), and n is a unit vector. Oh wait, the Pauli spin matrices are σx, σy, σz, right? So σ · n would be the dot product, which means n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. 

Wait, eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian... I remember that for Pauli matrices, when multiplied by a vector, the operator's eigenvalues depend on the magnitude of the coefficients. But wait, wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you have a sum, the eigenvalues might be different.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, and any linear combination like σ · n would have eigenvalues equal to the magnitude of the vector multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, I think the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1, but scaled by ε? No, wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have trace zero and determinant -1. But when multiplied by a scalar and added together, the eigenvalues are the sum multiplied by the coefficients? Or perhaps the eigenvalues are just ±1 multiplied by some factor.

Wait, let's consider a simpler case. Suppose n is along the z-axis, so n = (0,0,1). Then σ · n is σz. The eigenvalues of σz are +1 and -1. So then H would be ε σz, right? So the eigenvalues would be ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), which are ±ε. So in that case, the eigenvalues are ±ε. 

But wait, n is arbitrary. The direction of n doesn't affect the eigenvalues, does it? Because any rotation just changes the direction, but the magnitude remains the same. So for any unit vector n, the operator σ · n would have eigenvalues ±1. Then H would be ε times that, giving eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, but wait another thing. Pauli matrices are dimensionless? Or do they have units? Oh, wait, in the context of quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, but when you multiply them by ε, which has units of energy, then H has units of energy, which makes sense.

So the eigenvalues of H should be ±ε. Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. Option C has ε multiplied by hbar/2. Why would that happen? Oh wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The Pauli matrices are actually 2x2 matrices with entries like [[0,1],[1,0]] for σx, and so on. Their trace is zero, and determinant is -1. But the eigenvalues of σ · n would be the same as the eigenvalues of σz, which are ±1, but wait, is there a factor of ħ involved?

Wait, no. The Pauli matrices are usually written with factors of ħ (like σ · B would involve ħ in some contexts), but in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. So perhaps in this case, the operator doesn't have the ħ factor. So the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

But wait, let me think about the Dirac equation or spin terms. In some cases, the spin term is (σ · p) ħ, but in this problem, ε is just a constant with energy dimension. So the Hamiltonian is already scaled by ε, so the eigenvalues should be ±ε, right?

So the correct answer would be option B, which is +ε and -ε. So the eigenvalues are plus and minus ε.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian depend on the eigenvalues of the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The Pauli spin matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \) are 2x2 matrices, and any linear combination \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) (where \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). This is because the dot product \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) corresponds to a spin operator in the direction of \( \vec{n} \), and the eigenvalues of such an operator are always \( \pm 1 \). When scaled by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \).

The direction of \( \vec{n} \) does not affect the eigenvalues, as the eigenvalues depend only on the magnitude of the operator, not its direction. Therefore, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not dimensionless.
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues do not involve a factor of \( \hbar/2 \) in this context.
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not \( \hbar/2 \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
