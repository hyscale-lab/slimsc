Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear physics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about nuclear decay processes. The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The outgoing E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q. Now, there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

I need to compare the energy spectrum of E particles in the two cases. The options are about whether the spectrum becomes discrete or remains continuous, and whether the endpoint increases or decreases.

Hmm, I remember that in beta decay, when a nucleus emits a beta particle (like an electron), the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the beta particle's energy depends on the Q value and the kinetic energy distribution. But in that case, the decay is 1A → 1B + beta + antineutrino. Wait, but that's for beta minus decay.

In the original decay here, two E particles are emitted. Their total energy is continuous, which suggests that the energy each can take varies. That makes me think that perhaps the decay process has multiple particles, and the energy is shared among them, leading to a continuous spectrum.

Wait, but why is the E spectrum continuous? Because when multiple particles are emitted, their energies can vary as long as the total energy and momentum are conserved. So in the original case, two E and two V particles are emitted. Each E would have a certain energy, but since they are emitted in the decay, their energy distribution is spread out, hence the continuous spectrum.

In the variant decay, instead of two V particles, there's one M which is massless and exotic. So the product is 2B + 2E + M.

Wait, but M is massless. So M doesn't contribute any rest mass, only energy and momentum. Since M is emitted along with the E particles, how does this affect the energy available for the E's?

I think the total energy released in the decay is fixed (the Q value). So in the original process, Q is the total energy available for the emitted particles. That energy is distributed among the E's and V's.

In the variant decay, the products are 2E, 2B, and M. So the energy that was previously going into two V
