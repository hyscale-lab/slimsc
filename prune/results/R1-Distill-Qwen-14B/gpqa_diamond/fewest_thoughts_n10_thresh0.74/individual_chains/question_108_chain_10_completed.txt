Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's see... I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem states that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much bigger, much smaller, or comparable to ΔE.

Wait, what's the paramagnetic coupling term here? Oh right, in the context of atoms in a magnetic field, the magnetic interactions come into play. I remember that the Hamiltonian for paramagnetism usually involves the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field.

So the paramagnetic term is probably something like H_para = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is given by μ = gμ_B m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but the problem mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m, but since spin is more relevant here for paramagnetism, maybe I'm mixing them up. Wait, paramagnetism in hydrogen primarily comes from the electron's spin, not the orbital motion because for a hydrogen atom, the orbital angular momentum is zero in the ground state. But maybe the question is more general.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the orbital contribution, but I'm not sure. Let me think. The orbital magnetic moment is given by μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e)) * L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. But for hydrogen, in the ground state, l=0, so μ_orbital would be zero. So the paramagnetism must come from the spin.

Wait, but the problem says m is small. Oh, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which ranges from -l to +l. If m is small, perhaps l is small, like l=0 or 1. But if l is zero, the orbital contribution is zero. So maybe this is about the spin magnetic quantum number? Or maybe the problem is mixing terms up.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number m can be small, but for a hydrogen atom, even with m=0, the orbital term would be zero. Hmm, perhaps the problem is talking about the spin part. Or perhaps it's considering an atom with higher l, but let's proceed.

The paramagnetic term's expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be the energy shift due to the magnetic field. So let's compute that. The energy is H_para = - μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for spin is given by μ = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is the Landé g-factor for spin, approximately 2. So H_para = - (g_s μ_B m_s) * B.

Wait, but m_s can be ±1/2. So the expectation value, since m_s is ±1/2, the energy shift would be ± (g_s μ_B B) (1/2). Wait, but if the state is an eigenstate, then ⟨H⟩ would be that value. But since the problem is about the magnitude, we can consider the maximum possible value, or perhaps just the order of magnitude.

So the paramagnetic term's magnitude would be on the order of g_s μ_B B. Let me compute that.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is (eħ)/(2 m_e c) or something like that. Let me recall the value. μ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T.

Given B = 1 T, so H_para ≈ g_s * μ_B * B * m_s, but wait, no, the expression is H_para = - μ·B, but the magnitude is μ_B * B * g_s * m_s.

Wait, but m_s can be ±1/2. So the maximum energy shift magnitude is (g_s * μ_B * B) * (1/2). So let's compute this.

g_s is about 2, so:

H_para ≈ 2 * (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T * (1/2) = 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, so that's the magnitude of the paramagnetic term's energy shift.

Now, what about ΔE, the transition energy of hydrogen? The wavelength given is λ = 0.4861 micrometers, which is the wavelength for the Balmer series transition from n=2 to n=1, which is the H-alpha line. So the energy ΔE can be found using the photon energy equation: ΔE = hc / λ.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861e-6 meters (since 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters).

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) 

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 0.4861e-6 m:

1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ (1.9878 / 0.4861) * 1e-19 ≈ approximately 4.09e-19 J.

Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Because 1eV is about 1.6e-19 J, so 4e-19 J is about 2.5 eV. But the Balmer transition is about 13.6 eV (from n=2 to n=1 actually is higher; wait, wait, let me think again.

Wait no, the Balmer series is from n=3 to n=2, and the wavelength for that is about 656 nm, but the given wavelength is 486 nm, which is the transition from n=4 to n=2, I think. Let me double-check. The hydrogen spectrum lines: Lyman series (n=2→1, 121 nm), Balmer (n=3→2, 656 nm), and then the other lines like n=4→2 is 486 nm (that's the Balmer's beta line, H-beta?), and n=5→2 is 434 nm, etc.

Wait, but the exact wavelength isn't crucial for the order of magnitude. So the energy ΔE is hc/lambda. Let me compute it precisely.

hc ≈ 1240 eV·nm. So hc/lambda (in nm) gives ΔE in eV. Lambda is 0.4861 micrometers = 486.1 nm.

So ΔE ≈ 1240 / 486.1 ≈ approximately 2.55 eV. To get that in Joules, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 2.55 eV is 2.55 * 1.6e-19 ≈ 4.08e-19 J.

So ΔE is about 4.08e-19 J.

Earlier, the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ was approximately 9.274e-24 J. Wait, but that's about 1e-23 J, which is way smaller than 4e-19 J.

So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait. Did I compute the paramagnetic term correctly? Let me double-check.

H_para = -g_s μ_B B m_s.

Wait, μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. So with B=1 T, H_para ≈ 2 * 9.274e-24 * (1/2) * 1 T? Wait, wait, wait. Because m_s is ±1/2. So the maximum shift is g_s * μ_B * B * (1/2). So 2 * (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T * (1/2) = 9.274e-24 J. Oh, that's correct.

So 9.274e-24 J is about 5.8e-6 eV, because 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 9.274e-24 / 1.6e-19 = ~5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but the transition energy is 2.55 eV. So the ratio is 5.8e-5 eV (H_para) compared to 2.55 eV (ΔE). So H_para is about 2.27e-5 times smaller than ΔE. So H_para is way, way smaller than ΔE.

Therefore, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, so the correct option should be C) ⟨H⟩ much less than ΔE.

But wait, the question says "for small values of m". Oh, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For hydrogen, the ground state (n=1) has l=0, so m=0. So the orbital contribution would be zero. But higher states have l>0. But the problem says small m, which could mean m is zero or ±1, so perhaps small in magnitude, but if l is small, the expectation value of the orbital term would be small.

Wait, wait. The paramagnetic term for orbital magnetic moment is H_orbital = -μ_orbital · B. μ_orbital is given by μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e c)) * L, where L is angular momentum.

But the expectation value of L_z in a state with quantum numbers n, l, m is mħ. So ⟨L_z⟩ = mħ.

So the expectation value of H_orbital would be - (e/(2m_e c)) * ⟨L_z⟩ * B.

But for a given state, say, with m=0, this would be zero. For m=1, it would be non-zero.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. So perhaps it's considering a state with m=0 or m=±1. Let's suppose m=1. Then what would be the expectation value?

The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e c), so μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T. So the orbital term would be H_orbital = -(e/(2m_e c)) * mħ * B.

Wait, substituting mħ = m (ħ), but m is the quantum number here, but let me think in terms of the variables.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express H_orbital in terms of μ_B.

H_orbital = - m * μ_B * B, perhaps? Wait, let's see:

μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e c)) * L, and L_z = mħ.

So μ_orbital_z = (e/(2m_e c)) * mħ.

H_orbital = - μ_orbital_z * B = - (e/(2m_e c)) * mħ * B.

But e/(2m_e c) is μ_B / ħ, because μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e c). So substituting:

H_orbital = - (μ_B / ħ) * mħ * B = -μ_B m B.

Ah, so H_orbital = -μ_B m B.

So the expectation value of H_orbital would be proportional to m.

Wait, but m can be up to l, which could be up to n-1. But the problem states m is small. So perhaps m is zero or ±1.

In the case of m=0, the expectation value is zero. For m=1, it's -μ_B *1 * B.

So for m=1, H_orbital = - (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 * 1 T = -9.274e-24 J, same as the spin case earlier.

But wait, in the spin case, the maximum shift was about 9.274e-24 J, same as this. So whether it's spin or orbital, the energy shift is similar in magnitude when m=1/2 or m=1.

But the problem mentions that m is small. So perhaps m is 1, which gives a similar magnitude to the spin case.

But regardless, the energy shift is about 1e-23 J, while the transition energy is about 4e-19 J. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller.

Wait, but wait, the paramagnetic coupling term and the transition energy are being compared. So the paramagnetic term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field, while the transition energy is the energy difference between two atomic states.

But in the problem statement, are we talking about the expectation value of the paramagnetic term, or the actual energy shift?

Wait, the problem says: "compare the order of magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term with transition energy ΔE of Hydrogen atom with wavelength λ=0.4861μ m."

So the paramagnetic coupling term is H_para, whose expectation is ⟨H_para⟩, and ΔE is the energy of the transition.

So the conclusion is that ⟨H_para⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term \(\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle\) with the transition energy \(\Delta E\) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two quantities as follows:

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \(\vec{B}\). For spin paramagnetism, the energy shift is given by:

\[
H_{\text{para}} = -\mu \cdot \vec{B},
\]

where \(\mu = g \mu_B m_s\) is the magnetic moment, \(g\) is the gyromagnetic ratio, \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\) is the Bohr magneton, and \(m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2}\) is the spin magnetic quantum number. Substituting these values, the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is:

\[
\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle \approx g \mu_B B |m_s| = 2 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Transition Energy \(\Delta E\)
The transition energy \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the energy difference between two atomic states and is related to the wavelength \(\lambda\) of the emitted or absorbed photon by:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) is Planck's constant, \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\) is the speed of light, and \(\lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Comparison
The paramagnetic coupling term \(\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}\) is significantly smaller than the transition energy \(\Delta E \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\). To quantify the ratio:

\[
\frac{\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{4.08 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

This indicates that \(\langle H_{\text{para}} \rangle\) is approximately \(2.27 \times 10^{-5}\) times \(\Delta E\), meaning the paramagnetic coupling term is many orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
