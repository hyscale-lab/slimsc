Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the scientist is running a quantitative PCR to make a calibration curve. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in three technical replicates. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. The results show Ct values for different concentrations.

Looking at the data, the Ct values decrease as the concentration increases. That makes sense because more copies mean it reaches the threshold sooner, so lower Ct. Like, at 100,000 copies, the Ct is around 33-34, and it goes down to about 20 when it's just 10 copies. So that trend is correct.

The options given are about why there are discrepancies in his results. Wait, the question says 'which explains the discrepancies in his results.' Hmm, but wait, the data looks pretty consistent. Each concentration's Ct values are in a tight range. Like, 33.9, 34.2, 34.5—those are very close. Same with the others. So, maybe the question is about whether these results are correct, not discrepancies.

Wait, the question is asking why there are discrepancies. But looking at the data, the replicates are very close. So perhaps the issue is not with the replicates themselves but with the interpretation of the data in terms of the standard curve.

The options:

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No, that's not true. qPCR is used for quantification, so A is wrong.

Option B: Ct values don't align with target nucleic acid amounts. But the trend shows lower Ct with higher copies, which aligns. Unless the efficiency is wrong, but efficiency is 100% here, so maybe not.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Hmm, wait. The slope is -3.3. Oh, wait, the slope in a standard curve is usually around -3.32 for 100% efficiency. Because a 10-fold dilution should decrease Ct by 3.32 cycles. So the slope is correct. So why is this an option? Oh, maybe the question is about something else.

Wait, the options are about why there's a discrepancy. So if the slope is correct, then perhaps the other options don't fit.

Option D: The deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3. Let's check the data. The maximum deviation between replicates is 0.3, like in the 100000 group: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5—max difference 0.6 between the first and third. Wait, 34.5 minus 33.9 is 0.6. So the deviation is 0.6. So D says the deviation is more than 0.3. So D would be correct if the variance is more than 0.3, but in
