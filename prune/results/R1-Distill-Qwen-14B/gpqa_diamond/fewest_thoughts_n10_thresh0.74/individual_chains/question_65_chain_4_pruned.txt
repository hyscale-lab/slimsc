Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, I need to figure out the major products formed in two different reactions. Let me take it step by step.

First, the first reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that KH is a strong base, often used in deprotonations. THF is a solvent. So, what's the structure of the starting material?

The compound is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom—in this case, the spiro atom is the 1-position. The spiro indicates that there are two rings: one is a 5-membered ring and the other a 3-membered? Wait, no, wait. The spiro notation is [number of carbons in each ring -1 for each part]. Wait, the formula is spiro[m.n], where m and n are the number of carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5]non would mean the main chain is non (nine carbons?), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's two rings connected at a single carbon. Let me think: 1-vinyl would be a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to the spiro atom.

The structure is a spiro compound, so two rings connected at a single carbon. The rings are non-en-5-en-1-ol, meaning perhaps a 5-membered and a 3-membered ring? Or maybe a 4 and 6? Wait, the formula is non, which is 9 carbons. Hmm, maybe the spiro compound is a bicyclic structure.

Wait, maybe the spiro ring is 3 carbons and 5 carbons? Let me visualize. So position 1 is the spiro carbon. The substituents would be a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) and the two rings. So the molecule is a spiro compound with a vinyl group attached. The molecule has an enol structure, which suggests it can undergo some kind of enolization or elimination.

In the presence of a strong base like KH (which is a potassium hydride, a strong base), the alcohol (the -ol group) is deprotonated. Since it's an enol, maybe it's more acidic. Deprotonation would form an enolate. But wait, the conditions are THF and then H+. Wait, maybe a conjugate base is formed, which then reacts.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case for a conjugate addition or elimination. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, another possibility: when a cyclic ether or a similar structure is treated with a strong base, it can undergo ring-opening or some kind of elimination.

Wait, I think this reaction might be a Claisen or Cope rearrangement? Or perhaps an electrocyclic reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, but that involves vicinal diols. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: 1-vinylspiro compounds when treated with a strong base can undergo a ring-opening. Maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to ring strain relief
