Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pericyclic reactions, especially sigmatropic rearrangements. But let's take it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions 1, 2, and 3, each leading to products A, B, and C respectively. The options are given, so I need to figure out which option correctly matches all three products.

Starting with Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under acidic conditions and heat to form A.

Hmm, I remember that when amines react with alcohols, especially under acidic conditions, it's often an example of a Claisen or Cope rearrangement, which are sigmatropic shifts. Wait, wait. But wait, the starting compounds here—1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like a di-substituted amine with two methoxy groups. And but-3-en-2-ol is a secondary alcohol with a double bond adjacent to the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but Claisen rearrangement typically involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But here we have an amine. Oh, wait—maybe it's a variation. The presence of H+ and heat suggests a rearrangement mechanism.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like (CH3O)2CH2NH2? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be OCH3 groups on the ethylamine. So the structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2. Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would make the structure CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or perhaps it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more like (CH2OCH3)2NH.

Wait, maybe I should draw it. The structure is ethan-1-amine, so the amine is on the first carbon. 1,1-dimethoxy means two methoxy groups on the
