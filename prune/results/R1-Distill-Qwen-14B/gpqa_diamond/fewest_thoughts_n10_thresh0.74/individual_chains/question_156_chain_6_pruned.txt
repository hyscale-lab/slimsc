Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene, both treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

Okay, let's start by breaking down the reactions. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are commonly used as oxidizing agents, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. That's Reaction 1 and Reaction 2.

But wait, the question says both reactions go to 100% completion. So each starting alkene will fully convert into an epoxide. Then, after that, they are treated with aqueous acid. Hmm, what happens when epoxides are treated with acid?

Oh right, acid-catalyzed ring-opening of epoxides. In acidic conditions, the epoxide oxygen gets protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, water or another nucleophile attacks. But in this case, since it's aqueous acid, I think the nucleophile is water.

The ring-opening of epoxides under acidic conditions typically proceeds via a two-step mechanism. The first step is the protonation of the epoxide oxygen, breaking the ring and forming a good leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized (like in carbocation formation). Wait, but sometimes it's a concerted process.

Wait, but waitâ€”epoxides can form different products based on the structure. Let me think about oct-4-ene. Both (E) and (Z) isomers have the same carbon skeleton, just different configurations.

When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Similarly for (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then, each epoxide reacts with aqueous acid.

But wait, how does the configuration of the starting alkene (E or Z) affect the epoxide structure? Oh, because the double bond geometry determines the arrangement of the substituents in the epoxide
