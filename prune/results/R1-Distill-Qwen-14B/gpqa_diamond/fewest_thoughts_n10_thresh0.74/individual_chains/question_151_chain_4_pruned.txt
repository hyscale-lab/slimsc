Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, quantum states are usually represented as column vectors, right? Oh, but wait, I should normalize them, right? Because the state vector needs to be a unit vector. Wait, but I'm not sure if the state is already normalized. Let me check.

The state vector is [-1, 2, 1]. To find its norm, I calculate the sum of squares of each component: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector's actual form is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ].

Wait, but the problem didn't specify if the state is normalized. Hmm. I think in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector, so perhaps I should normalize it. So I'll proceed with the normalized state.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix P is given as:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says the elements in the first row are (0, 1/sqrt{2}, 0), the second row as (1/sqrt{2}, 0, 1/sqrt{2}), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt{2}, 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian. To be Hermitian, P must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real, the transpose of P should equal P.

Looking at P's transpose: first column becomes first row. So the first column of P is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], which would be the first row after transpose.
