Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again carefully.

So the setup is that someone is doing an experiment with white lupine plants to find genes that contribute to resistance against a fungal disease called anthracnose. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made knockout mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3).

They know that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes. So the presence of a transcription factor might be necessary to activate certain genes that contribute to disease resistance.

They tested the mutants for their resistance to the pathogen. The control is 100% resistance. The results are as follows:

- g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
- g2: 0% (so completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (moderately susceptible)
- g1g3: 10% (very susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (susceptible)
- g1g2: 0% (susceptible)

Hmm. So looking at the single mutants, g2 is the most affected, with zero resistance. Then g1 is next, at 75%, and g3 at 50%. 

The double mutants' resistances are all quite low. g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. The other double mutants (g1g2 and g2g3) are both 0%, which is the same as g2 alone.

I need to figure out the relationship between these genes based on the resistance levels.

So first, what's the normal situation? The wild type has 100% resistance. So the presence of these genes contributes to that resistance.

In the mutants, knocking out a gene reduces resistance. So if a gene is knocked out and resistance is lower, that gene contributes positively to resistance. 

Looking at the single mutants:

- g2 mutant has 0% resistance. So G2's product is essential for resistance. Or, perhaps G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. If G2 is absent, then those downstream genes aren't expressed, and the plant can't resist the disease.

Wait, but the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. Let's think about that. If G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of target genes. So without G2, the plant can't activate the necessary defense genes, leading to susceptibility.

So for G2: when it's knocked out, resistance is 0%. So without G2, the plant is completely susceptible. That suggests G2 might be the transcription factor, because without it, the downstream genes can't be activated.

Looking at the other single mutants: G1 knockout (g1) has 75% resistance. That's a 25% drop. So G1 contributes to resistance, but perhaps it's not as critical as G2. Similarly, G3 knockout (g3) has 50% resistance, which is a 50% drop.

When considering the double mutants, let's see:

g1g2: 0%. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, resistance is 0%. But g2 alone is already 0%. So in this case, knocking out G1 in a g2 background doesn't change the phenotype. So the phenotype is the same as the more severe one. So perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if G2 is epistatic to G1, that would mean that the presence of a functional G2 gene masks the effect of G1. Wait, but in this case, when G2 is non-functional (g2), the resistance is 0% regardless of G1's status. So G2 is epistatic to G1 because in the absence of G2, the presence of G1 doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, the g2g3 double mutant has 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. So again, the presence of G3 doesn't matter when G2 is absent.

What about the g1g3 mutant? Its resistance is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%) alone. So when both G1 and G3 are absent, the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. That suggests that their effects are additive or perhaps they function in separate pathways. Alternatively, maybe they function in the same pathway and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. But in this case, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone, which is additive.

Wait, but in the case of epistasis, the pathway might have a particular order. For instance, if two genes are in the same pathway, and G1 acts upstream of G3, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more downstream mutation. But here, when both are knocked out, it's worse than either. So perhaps they are in separate pathways, so their effects add up. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant, and each contributes a part of the resistance. But then knocking both out would have a worse effect.

Alternatively, perhaps their genes are in a linear pathway with G2 being upstream of both. Since G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it activates both G1 and G3.

Wait, but in the single mutants, without G2, G1 and G3 wouldn't be expressed. So if G2 is a transcription factor, then in g2 mutants, neither G1 nor G3 is expressed. So perhaps G1 and G3 are downstream of G2.

So let's think about the double mutants. For example, the g1g3 double mutant: if G2 is the transcription factor, then in a wild type, G2 activates G1 and G3. In the g1g3 mutant, both G1 and G3 are knocked out. But wait, in the g1g3 mutant, are their G2 functional? Oh, wait, no. The g1g3 mutant is G1 and G3 knocked out, but G2 is still present and functional.

Wait no, wait. The double mutants are generated by knocking out both genes. So g1g3 is the genotype where G1 and G3 are both knocked out, but G2 is normal. So in that case, G2 is functional.

Wait, but in the results, the g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance. That's much worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance plummets.

But in the single mutants, when G2 is present, and either G1 or G3 is knocked out, the resistance is higher than when both are knocked out. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance, and knocking out both makes the resistance much worse.

Alternatively, perhaps G2, G1, and G3 are in a linear pathway. Suppose G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Then, in a g2 mutant, both G1 and G3 are not expressed. So in the g1g3 mutant, which has G2 functional, so G2 would activate any remaining G1 or G3â€”but wait, if G1 and G3 are knocked out, then they can't be activated. So perhaps in the g1g3 mutant, even though G2 is active, it can't activate G1 or G3 because those are knocked out. So the plant's resistance is very low.

Wait, but the g1 mutant has 75% resistance. So without G1, but G2 and G3 are present. So maybe G2 activates G3, which then contributes to resistance. Or maybe G3 is also a transcription factor that activates other genes.

Alternatively, perhaps when G1 is knocked out, the plant can still get some resistance through G3, which is partially functional. But when G3 is knocked out, the plant's resistance is lower.

Wait, maybe I should try to model this.

Let me make a table of the data:

Mutant genotype | Resistance
----------------|-----------
Wild type (WT) | 100%
g1 | 75%
g2 | 0%
g3 | 50%
g1g2 | 0%
g1g3 | 10%
g2g3 | 0%

So, the first thing I notice is that all double mutants that include g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) show 0% resistance. Since g2 alone is 0%, that suggests that when G2 is non-functional, the other gene's status doesn't matter. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

Now, what about the g1g3 mutant, which is 10% resistance. Since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional, perhaps the plant relies on another pathway or another gene that is still functional. But without G1 and G3, the remaining resistance is minimal.

So, G2 is the most critical gene because its knockout alone gives 0% resistance. So G2 is likely the transcription factor because if it's a TF, then in its absence, the downstream genes (G1 and G3) can't be activated, leading to no resistance.

So the hierarchy would be G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, perhaps.

But looking at the single mutants: g1 is 75% which is better than g3's 50%. So G1 is more important than G3. Or perhaps they function in separate pathways.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single knockout. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. So knocking both out removes both contributions, leading to much lower resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are redundant, so each can compensate for the other. If they are redundant, then knocking out both would have a much worse effect than either single knockout. So for example, if each contributes 25% of the resistance, then together they contribute 50% (g3 is 50%, so maybe G3 alone does 50%, which doesn't add up. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the wild type is 100%. So without G2, it's 0%, which suggests that G2 is essential for any resistance. So G2 must be a transcription factor that is required for activating the genes necessary for resistance.

So, without G2, the other genes (G1 and G3) can't be expressed or can't function because their expression is downstream of G2.

Wait no, because the single mutants g1 and g3 have lower resistance, but not zero. So perhaps G1 and G3 are not directly downstream of G2, but their expression is partially dependent on G2. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is not a direct TF for G1 and G3, but without G2, the plant's overall resistance mechanism is compromised.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a regulator that activates another gene, which in turn activates G1 and G3. But in the absence of G2, that other gene isn't expressed, so G1 and G3 aren't either.

Wait, but the single mutants g1 and g3 have reduced resistance (75% and 50% respectively). So perhaps G1 and G3 are not entirely dependent on G2. Maybe they have some other activation pathway.

But the double mutants that include G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0% resistance. That suggests that when G2 is knocked out, the other genes' status doesn't matter because resistance is already gone. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So the order is G2 is upstream.

So now, thinking about the other double mutant: g1g3 has 10% resistance. Since both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional, that suggests that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance when G2 is present. Without G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, resistance is 0%.

So in the wild type, G2 is active, and activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So without G2, G1 and G3 can't function. But in the wild type, G2 is present, so G1 and G3 are active.

Now, the single mutants:

- g1 (no G1): resistance is 75% of WT. So G1 contributes 25% to resistance. So without G1, the remaining 75% comes from other factors, perhaps G3.

- g3 (no G3): resistance is 50% of WT. So G3 contributes 50% of the resistance, and G1 contributes 25%, and perhaps other factors contribute the rest.

Wait, but when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. So 10% compared to WT. So without G1 and G3, only 10% of resistance remains. So perhaps that 10% comes from another gene or pathway not involving G1 and G3.

But in the absence of G2, even if G1 and G3 are present, resistance is 0%. So G2 is essential for the main pathway of resistance, which likely involves G1 and G3.

Putting this together:

G2 is the transcription factor. It activates G1 and G3, which are downstream. Both G1 and G3 contribute to resistance when G2 is present. So when G1 is knocked out, G3 can still contribute some resistance (g1:75%). When G3 is knocked out, G1 contributes less (g3:50%). When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is present, then only 10% resistance remains, perhaps from another gene or a minor pathway. 

But wait, in the double mutants with G2 knocked out (g1g2 and g2g3), the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So the presence of G1 or G3 doesn't help when G2 is absent. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3.

So what's the epistatic relationship here? Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. So if G2 is non-functional, the presence of G1 or G3 doesn't matter.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

But our analysis suggests G2 is the transcription factor, so A is incorrect.

Option B: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm, same promoter? That might mean they're co-regulated, but I don't know. But from the data, G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. But does G3 being epistatic to G1 make sense? If G3 is epistatic, then the presence of G3 would mask the effect of G1. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So I'm not sure. Also, the question says at least one is a transcription factor. So G2 is the transcription factor here.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. Not sure if that's relevant here. Also, from the data, when G1 and G3 are both knocked out, resistance is worse than either alone. So perhaps their pathways are additive, not epistatic. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then knocking out G3 would not change the resistance if G1 is already knocked out. But in the data, g1g3 is worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%), which suggests that they are additive, not epistatic.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, gene redundancy is when two genes can perform the same function. So if G1 and G3 are redundant, knocking out both would have a worse effect than either alone. Which matches our data: g1g3 is 10% resistance, worse than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So this suggests redundancy. But does G1 being epistatic to G3 make sense here?

Hmm, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G1 is epistatic to G3, then the presence of G1 would mask the effect of G3. Wait, but in the g1g3 mutant, the resistance is worse than either single mutant. That would imply that their effects are additive, not epistatic. So maybe D is not the right option.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that means G3's function is only seen when G1 is not present. So in the presence of G1, G3 doesn't matter. But our data shows that when both are knocked out, the resistance is lower than when either is knocked out. So that would imply that their functions are additive, not epistatic.

So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their effects are additive. But then, the presence of epistasis in the options may not fit.

Wait, let me think again about epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the phenotype of one gene masks the effect of another. So, for example, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the presence of a functional A gene will determine the phenotype, regardless of gene B's state. But in cases where the effects are additive, the two genes are in separate pathways or contribute to the same pathway in a non-epistatic way.

Given that the double mutant g1g3 has a lower resistance than either single mutant, it suggests that their effects are additive, not epistatic. So G1 and G3 are in separate pathways or contribute in a linear way that their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.

But looking at the options, which ones align with this?

Option C: G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy refers to a single gene affecting multiple traits. I don't think that's the case here because the question is about their effects on resistance. Not sure.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. Redundancy would mean that each can perform the same function, so knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. That matches the data (g1g3 is 10% vs g1's 75% and g3's 50%). So this seems plausible.

But what about the epistatic part in D? It says G1 is epistatic towards G3. So if G1 is epistatic, then the presence of G1 would influence whether G3's effect is seen. But in the data, when both are knocked out, the effect is additive. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistasis in D refers to G2 being epistatic to G1 and G3. Because in the options, the statements are about the conclusions, which may not all fit.

Wait, looking back, the options each have three points:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1.

No, because we think G2 is the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same regulation), G3 epistatic to G1.

If G3 is epistatic to G1, then in the presence of functional G3, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. But in our case, when both are knocked out, resistance is worse than either, which doesn't match this.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Again, not sure about pleiotropy. And the additive effect in g1g3 doesn't support G1 being epistatic.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

So redundancy fits with the g1g3 data. But what about the epistatic part? If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the presence of G1, G3's effect is masked. So in the g3 mutant, which has 50% resistance, but in the presence of G1, perhaps G3's effect is only seen when G1 is absent. But in the data, the g1 mutant has 75% resistance, which is better than g3's 50%. So if G1 is epistatic to G3, then knocking out G1 (g1) would allow G3 to contribute more. But in the data, g1 has 75% (so less drop than g3's 50%). So this doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong.

Wait, maybe if G3 is epistatic to G1. Then in the presence of G3, the effect of G1 is masked. So G1's effect is only seen when G3 is knocked out. But that doesn't fit the data either.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is not between G1 and G3, but between G2 and the others.

So perhaps G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which aligns with the data, because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, regardless of G1 or G3.

So looking back at the options, which option includes that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1. So that's part of it.

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But the correct conclusion is that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3, which is not directly stated in any option.

Wait, looking again:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Yes, that's correct in part. But the first part of option A says G1 is the TF, which is incorrect because our data suggests G2 is the TF.

Other options:

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the presence of G1, the effect of G3 is masked. But in the data, the g1g3 double mutant is more susceptible than either single mutant. So if G1 is epistatic, then in the presence of G1, G3's function doesn't matter. So when both are knocked out, you would expect the same as each single (if G1 is epistatic). But in our case, both knocked out is worse than either, which suggests additive, not epistatic.

So perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their effects are additive. But none of the options directly say that.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would explain the additive effect in the g1g3 mutant. But the epistatic part is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps in D, G1 being epistatic to G3 is not related to the data, but the important points are G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 are redundant.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me think again. Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions. So knocking both out has a much worse effect than either alone. So that fits with the g1g3 data. So that part of D is correct.

So D says G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But if they are redundant, their functions are additive, which would not involve epistasis. So perhaps the statement about epistasis in D is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the epistatic part in D is referring to the order of G1 and G3 in the pathway. If G1 is epistatic to G3, that means G1 acts upstream of G3. So, in the pathway, G2 activates G1, which activates G3. So, if both are knocked out, the effect would be as bad as the more upstream gene. But in the double mutant, the effect is worse than either, which suggests they are in separate pathways.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

The options list three conclusions. We need to pick the one that best fits.

Option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy isn't really supported here because the question is about resistance to anthracnose, so it's a single trait. So G1 and G3's effects on this trait are not pleiotropic. So this is probably not correct.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 have gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

We've established G2 is a TF. G1 and G3 are redundant, which explains the additive effect. But the statement about G1 being epistatic to G3 doesn't fit the data. So maybe that part is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic part refers to the position in the pathway. If G1 is upstream of G3, then G1 is epistatic. But in this case, the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more upstream gene. But in our case, the double mutant is worse than either, which doesn't fit.

Wait, another way. Epistasis in genetic terms is about the relationship in the pathway. Suppose gene A is upstream of gene B. Then, if A is mutated (non-functional), the mutation in B doesn't affect the phenotype because B's product isn't made anyway. So A is epistatic to B.

In our case, G2 is upstream of G1 and G3. So G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. So when G2 is knocked out, the phenotype is the same regardless of G1 or G3. So that aligns with the data.

Now, looking for an option that states that G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, the epistatic relationships are:

A) G2 is epistatic towards G1.

B) G3 is epistatic towards G1.

C) G1 is epistatic towards G3.

D) G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Only A mentions G2 being epistatic towards G1. But in reality, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. But the options don't have a choice that includes both.

So in the options, only option A partially captures this, but the first part of A is incorrect because it says G1 is the TF.

Thus, the correct option must be D, because it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, and the fact that G1 and G3 are redundant.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the epistatic statement in D doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the option isn't aligned perfectly, but D is the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic part is not the main point for the answer.

So, to sum up:

- G2 is the transcription factor, as the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance, and all double mutants involving g2 also have 0%.
- G1 and G3 are redundant because their double mutant (g1g3) has a much worse phenotype than either single mutant.
- The epistatic relationships: G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

Looking at the options, option D says G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3. But the data doesn't directly support G1 being epistatic to G3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the possible answer is. The options don't directly include the correct epistatic relationship for G2, but perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, let me go back.

In the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So the functions of G1 and G3 are additive. So they are in separate pathways. So in this case, G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. So when both are knocked out, the plant's resistance is the sum of the contributions of each. So that would be 75% (g1) + 50% (g3) = 125%, but the double mutant is 10%. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each contributes a certain part of the resistance.

Wait, maybe each contributes a part. So without G1, 25% is lost (75% remains). Without G3, 50% is lost (50% remains). So both together would lose 25% +50% =75%, so 25% remains. But the data says 10%, so that doesn't add up.

Hmm, maybe they share some functions. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and both are downstream of G2. In that case, knocking either G1 or G3 would reduce resistance, and knocking both would have a more severe effect.

But considering that, when G2 is present, G1 and G3 contribute to resistance. So G2 is the TF, activating G1 and G3, which in turn do something else, perhaps also activating other genes.

But how does that fit with the epistatic relationships?

So, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream of G2, and their effects are additive. So when both are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone.

Looking back at the options, which one correctly states that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, which is correct. So despite the epistatic part, which may not fit, perhaps D is the best option.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic part in D is not important, and the main point is that G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, pleiotropy is when a gene affects multiple traits. But the question is about a single trait (resistance), so I don't think that applies.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this differently. 

The main points from the data:

1. G2 knockout (g2) has 0% resistance. So G2 is critical and likely the transcription factor.

2. Double mutants involving g2 (g1g2, g2g3) all have 0% resistance. So G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3.

3. G1 knockout (g1) has 75% resistance. G3 knockout (g3) has 50% resistance. So G1 contributes more than G3.

4. The double mutant g1g3 has 10% resistance. That's worse than either single, suggesting their functions are additive, not in a linear pathway.

So, putting this together:

- G2 is the TF, upstream of G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to resistance. Thus, their functions are additive.

So, in this scenario, the conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (gene redundancy?), and their effects are additive.

Looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. But that's when they have the same function. So if they're redundant, their combined knockout would have a worse effect, which is what we see.

But redundancy would imply they have the same function, but in this case, G1 and G3 may have different functions but contribute additively.

Alternatively, perhaps the term 'show pleiotropy' isn't the right fit. But in the options, the only one that correctly identifies G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 having an additive effect (redundant) is D.

So, the answer is D: G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are redundant, their epistatic relationship wouldn't be relevant. So perhaps the 'G1 is epistatic towards G3' part is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the third part of the option is about another relationship. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I don't see how pleiotropy applies here.

Another approach: consider the phenotypes of the double mutants.

The g1g3 mutant has 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. So the effect is additive, not epistatic. So G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other. Therefore, the options that suggest G1 is epistatic to G3 (options C and D) are incorrect in that aspect.

Therefore, the correct option must not involve G1 and G3 being epistatic. So looking at the options, only option A has G2 as epistatic to G1, but the first part is wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF and acts upstream of both G1 and G3. The presence of G1 and G3 in the same pathway would lead to an additive effect when both are knocked out. So option D says G1 and G3 are redundant, which would fit the additive effect.

So the correct answer is D.


The experiment investigates the roles of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in conferring resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. The results of the mutant analyses are as follows:

- **g1 (G1 knockout):** 75% resistance (25% reduction from wild type).
- **g2 (G2 knockout):** 0% resistance (completely susceptible).
- **g3 (G3 knockout):** 50% resistance (50% reduction from wild type).
- **g1g2 (G1 and G2 knockout):** 0% resistance.
- **g1g3 (G1 and G3 knockout):** 10% resistance.
- **g2g3 (G2 and G3 knockout):** 0% resistance.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **G2 is critical for resistance:** The g2 mutant has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is essential for resistance. Additionally, all double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) also show 0% resistance, confirming that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. This suggests that G2 acts upstream of the resistance pathway and is likely the transcription factor (TF).

2. **G1 and G3 contribute additively to resistance:** The single mutants g1 and g3 show reduced resistance (75% and 50%, respectively). The double mutant g1g3 has only 10% resistance, which is worse than either single mutant. This indicates that G1 and G3 contribute independently to resistance, with their effects being additive rather than epistatic.

3. **G1 and G3 are redundant:** The additive effect observed in the g1g3 mutant suggests that G1 and G3 are functionally redundant. Each gene contributes a portion of the resistance, and knocking out both results in a much more severe phenotype than either single knockout.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data clearly show G2 is the critical gene. Additionally, there is no evidence of pleiotropy for G2 and G3.
- **Option B:** Incorrect. While G2 is the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 have the same promoter is unsupported by the data. Furthermore, G3 is not epistatic to G1.
- **Option C:** Incorrect. The claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is not supported, as the data pertain to a single trait (resistance). Additionally, G1 is not epistatic to G3, as the g1g3 mutant shows an additive effect.
- **Option D:** Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, and the additive effect in the g1g3 mutant supports the idea that G1 and G3 are redundant. While the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 is not directly supported by the data, this option aligns most closely with the observed results.

### Conclusion:
The data support the conclusion that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and their combined knockout results in an additive reduction in resistance. Option D best captures these findings.
