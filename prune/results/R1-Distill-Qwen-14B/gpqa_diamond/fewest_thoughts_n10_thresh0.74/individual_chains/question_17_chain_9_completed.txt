Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says that there's a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in this solution, right?

Wait, what do I remember about complexes and dissociation? Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. So Ca^2+ and EDTA form this complex, right? The formula is probably CaY^2-, where Y is the EDTA^4-.

The problem says it's a stochiometric solution. Stochiometric means that the molar ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1. So if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, then the initial concentrations of Ca and EDTA before complexation would be... Wait, no. Because the complex is formed, so let me think.

Wait, the complex dissociates, right? The complex is CaY^2-, which can dissociate into Ca^2+ and Y^4- (EDTA). The equilibrium would look like:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

And the formation constant, Kf, is given. Wait, but the problem gives K_Ca-EDTA. Oh, wait, K for the complex... So K is the formation constant, Kf, which is [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]).

Wait, but in this problem, the solution is at stochiometric point. So initially, all the Ca and EDTA are in the complex. But wait, no. Stochiometric usually refers to the point where the moles of EDTA added are just enough to react completely with the metal ion. So perhaps the complex is at 0.02 M, and it dissociates a tiny bit.

Wait, no. The solution is 0.02 M CaY^2-. So the initial concentration of complex is 0.02 M. Then, it dissociates into Ca^2+ and Y^4-.

So the dissociation is:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-

The K for this reaction would be the inverse of the formation constant. Because the formation constant is Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]). So if the dissociation is CaY^2- dissociating, the equilibrium expression would be K_dissociation = 1/Kf = [Ca^2+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-}.

Wait, but the given K is K_Ca-EDTA. Let me think: is K the formation constant or the dissociation constant? The problem says K_Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. Formation constants are usually large, which makes sense because EDTA forms strong complexes. So I think K_Ca-EDTA is the formation constant, Kf = 5e10.

So for the dissociation, Kd (dissociation constant) would be 1/(Kf) = 2e-11.

So, the reaction is: CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-.

At equilibrium, the concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 minus the amount that dissociated. Let's call the change 'x'. So [Ca^2+] = x, [Y^4-] = x, and [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x.

But wait, given that Kf is so large (5e10), the complex is very stable. So the dissociation will be very minimal. So x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 M.

Then, Kd = x^2 / 0.02 ≈ 2e-11.

So solving for x:

x^2 = 2e-11 * 0.02

Wait, Kd is 1/(5e10) = 2e-11, right? So Kd = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) ≈ (x^2) / 0.02.

So x^2 = Kd * 0.02.

x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5?

Wait, sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(1e-13) is 1e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is about 6.32e-7.

Hmm, looking at the options, C is 6.3e-7 M. So that's likely the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Wait, K is 5e10, so Kf = [complex]/([Ca][EDTA]) =5e10.

At equilibrium, [Ca] = [EDTA] = x, and [complex] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kf = 0.02/(x^2) =5e10.

So x² = 0.02/(5e10) = 2e-12 / 10? Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. 2e-2 / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12.

So x² = 4e-13.

Wait, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5e12) )? Wait, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/(5)) *1e-12= 0.4e-12 = 4e-13.

So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5, which is about 6.32e-7.

So yes, option C is 6.3e-7.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we analyze the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant \( K_f \) is given as \( 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the dissociation constant \( K_d \) is the reciprocal of \( K_f \), so:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Let the concentration of dissociated calcium ions be \( x \). At equilibrium, the concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CaY}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{Y}^{4-}] = x.
\]

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
x^2 = (2 \times 10^{-11})(0.02) = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
