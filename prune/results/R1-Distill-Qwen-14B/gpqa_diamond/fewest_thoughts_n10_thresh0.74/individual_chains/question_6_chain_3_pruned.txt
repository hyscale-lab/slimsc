Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are A, B, C, D with different expressions for energy E.

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, the particle's motion can sometimes be separated into radial and angular parts, especially when using polar coordinates. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions for separation. Oh right, the potential has to be separable in terms of r and θ for the Schrödinger equation to be separable. Let me check the given potential: it's (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Oh, so both terms have r squared, but the angular part is cos squared theta. So, the potential is actually dependent on r² and cos²θ. That suggests it's separable because I can factor out r².

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The potential V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Because 1/2 kr² + 3/2 kr² cos²θ is the same as kr² (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ) = (kr²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). So, it's a function that depends on r² and cos²θ. 

So, in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ). The kinetic energy part is (p_r² + p_θ²)/(2m), right? So when you have a potential that's a function of r and θ, and the kinetic part is in terms of r and θ as well, perhaps you can separate variables.

Wait, but the potential here isn't spherically symmetric because it has that cos²θ term. So, the angular part isn't uniform in all directions. That makes me think that the solution might involve not just the usual spherical Bessel functions but perhaps something else, or maybe a separation into polar coordinates with a specific angular dependence.

The total Hamiltonian in polar coordinates (r, θ) for a two-dimensional system is:

H = ( -ħ²/(2m) ) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂/∂r) ) + ( -ħ²/(2m r²) ) ∂²/∂θ² ) + V(r,θ).

So, the potential here is V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Let me factor that as (1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ) kr². So, V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2 ].

Hmm. So, I can write V(r,θ) as r² times some function of θ. That suggests that the Hamiltonian is separable into r and θ parts, but with an angular dependence in the potential.

Wait, but to separate variables, the potential has to be expressible as
