Okay, so I've got this problem about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2 for the final state. Wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed.

The options are different transitions, like 1S0 going to something like 7D1 plus p, etc. Each option has a final state and a particle emitted. I think I need to look at both angular momentum and parity conservation here.

First, let me parse the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. Using the term symbol notation (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 means 2*0 +1 =1, so S=0. L is S, which is 0 in spectroscopic notation, so the orbital angular momentum is 0. J is 0, so the initial state has total angular momentum J=0.

The two nucleons are in a state with isospin T. Wait, the initial state's isospin must be considered because when they emit a particle, the isospin changes. But the Pauli requirement says that after emission, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, does that mean T, S, L are the quantum numbers of the final state? Because the initial state is 1S0, so S=0, L=0, and T? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the initial state is bound as NN. So what is their isospin? Well, two nucleons can be protons and neutrons or both neutrons. But wait, a 1S0 state is common for NN pairs, like in deuteron. Oh wait, the deuteron has spin 1, but this is 1S0 so spin 0. So maybe the initial state has spin S=0, orbital L=0, so J=0. So the initial NN has spin 0, but what about isospin?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The problem states that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So whatever the final state is, their T, S, L must satisfy this equation. And the final T is 0.

So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, 0 = S + L +1 mod2. So S + L must be 1 mod2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Either S is 0 and L is 1 (so 0+1=1 mod2, okay), or S is 1 and L is 0.

Wait, but what is the initial state's S and L? The initial state is 1S0, which means S=0 and L=0. So initial S=0, L=0. So when the particle X is emitted, the final state of NN must have S and L such that S + L is 1 mod2.

But the initial state's S and L are both 0. When the NN emit a particle, their angular momentum and spin must change. Let me think about the process. The NN system emits a particle X. So the initial NN state is 1S0, which has J=0. After emission, the NN state (the residual) has some state (like 7D1 or 3S1, etc.) and emits X.

Wait, I think I need to consider the conservation of angular momentum. The initial total angular momentum is J_initial = 0 (since it's 1S0). The final state consists of the NN state with angular momentum J_NN
