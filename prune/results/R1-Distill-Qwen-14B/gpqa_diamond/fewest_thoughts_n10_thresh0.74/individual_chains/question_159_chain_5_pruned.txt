Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops significantly below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines like Lyman-alpha (which is about 121 nm) can be redshifted. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the peak is at 790 nm, that's in the near infrared. So if the emission line is at 121 nm, but observed at 790, that means the wavelength has stretched by a factor of 790/121. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528. So the redshift z would be approximately 5.528. Because redshift z is (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength)/emitted wavelength, so 790-121=669, divided by 121 gives z≈5.528.

But wait, wait a second. 790 nm is in the near-infrared. Could this be a Lyman break? I think the Lyman series in quasars often gets redshifted into the optical or infrared. The Lyman-alpha emission line is at 121.6 nm. If the observed wavelength is around 790 nm, that would imply a redshift z = (790 - 121.6)/121.6 ≈ 668.4/121.6 ≈ 5.5. So z≈5.5.

So the redshift z is about 5.5. Now, the question is about the comoving distance to this quasar given the cosmological parameters. The comoving distance D_C is a function of the redshift, and it depends on the model parameters: H0, matter density Ω_m, dark energy Ω_Λ.

Given the parameters: H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m is 0.3, Ω_Λ is 0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0). So the standard Lambda-CDM model with these parameters.

I need to compute the comoving distance for z=5.5. I remember that the comoving distance is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_r (1+z')^4 + Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_Λ). But wait, in this case, since z is high, but Ω_r (radiation density) is probably negligible at z=5.5. Because radiation scales as (1+z)^4, and matter as (1+z)^3. So at z=5.5, matter density is 0.3*(1+5.5)^3 ≈ 0.3*(270.59) ≈ 81.18, but wait, that doesn
