Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll break it down step by step. 

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. There's also information about a product involving a keto acid and X, and something about the cumulative atomic masses of elements in X.

First, I'll try to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's start with the reaction details.

The reaction is violent, so maybe it's something exothermic or involves a strong acid. Liquid Y – could that be water? Because water is a common liquid and reacting violently could imply something like a metal reacting with water to produce hydrogen gas. Oh wait, gas W is mentioned. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think: H2O has 1 proton and 1 neutron, but wait, no, that's for each molecule. Wait, no, each molecule of H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and an O (8 protons, 8 neutrons if it's O-16). But the molecule's total number of protons and neutrons... Wait, no, the question says the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So for each molecule, the count of protons equals the count of neutrons.

Possible gases? Let's think: H2 is possible. Each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So for H2, 2 protons, 2 neutrons. That fits. So gas W might be H2. But wait, O2 would have 32 protons and 32 neutrons in each molecule (each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so O2 has 16 each). Wait, no, wait the total protons and neutrons in the entire molecule. Let's see:

- H2: 2 H atoms. Each has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So molecule H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So 2=2. That's equal. So W could be H2.

But wait, another possibility: CO2? No, that's a gas, but let's check. CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's 12C), O has 8 each. So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So that also fits. But wait, the reaction is violent. If Y is water, then maybe substance X is a metal reacting with water to produce H2 gas. So W is H2.

So if Y is H2O, and X is a metal, like Na or K. But wait, metals reacting with water usually produce H2 and their hydroxide. For example, sodium reacting with water gives NaOH and H2. So precipitate G would be something else? Wait, sodium hydroxide is soluble, so maybe G is another product. Wait, no, if X is a metal, sodium, the reaction is 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2↑. So in this case, the precipitate isn't formed because NaOH is soluble. Hmm, maybe not a metal then.

Wait, another possibility. Maybe X is an active metal that reacts with an acid, but wait, Y is a liquid. Maybe Y is an acid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else. Let me think again.

Wait, when X is a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a compound where one of its elements has an isotope that's heavier. Like Cl has isotopes, so maybe X is something like HCl? No, but HCl is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, a keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. Like acetoacetic acid or something. If X reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it's a base, like NaOH? Because if X is NaOH, a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid with a ketone group) would neutralize with it to form a sodium salt, water, etc. But how does that relate to the other parts.

Wait, let's think about B. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B is a solid that melts just above 0 C. What's a substance that has a melting point around there? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, but wait, when you heat a precipitate, what could it be? Maybe B is something like NaCl, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is a basic oxide or something.

Wait, when G is heated, perhaps it decomposes. For instance, if G is a carbonate, heating might release CO2 and form something else. But let's think about other possibilities.

Another approach: Let's think about the product that has 2 atoms of oxygen. X reacts with a keto acid, and the product has 2 O atoms. What if X is a dehydrating agent or something that adds oxygen? Or perhaps X is a base that neutralizes the keto acid into a salt with certain oxygen count.

Wait, let's list possible X candidates. The substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and especially its close analog. Maybe X is a strong base, like NaOH, KOH, or something else. Alternatively, it could be something like H2SO4, but that's a strong acid.

Wait, substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So it's a compound where one of the elements has a heavy isotope. For example, Cl is a common element with isotopes. If X is HCl, but that's a gas. Alternatively, if X is NaCl, but that's not a liquid. Hmm.

Wait, X reacts with Y (a liquid) to produce H2 gas. So if Y is H2O, and X is a metal, perhaps a Group 1 or 2 metal. But then, the precipitate would be the metal hydroxide, which is not likely to precipitate if it's soluble. Wait, perhaps Y is an acid. For example, if Y is HCl, a strong acid, and X is a metal that reacts violently with it, producing H2 gas.

Wait, let's think about the reaction equation. If X is a metal (M), Y is an acid (like HCl), then the reaction would be M + HCl → MCl + H2↑. If M is a transition metal, the precipitate G would be MCl, which is perhaps insoluble. Wait, but the reaction is violent, so it's probably a more reactive metal. Wait, but the product after G is heated is B, which when heated, releases B. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a carbonate. Wait, if Y is a carbonate and X is an acid (like HCl), then the reaction would release CO2 gas. But CO2 has 12 protons (from C) and 16 neutrons (8 in C, 8 in each O, but wait per molecule? Let me calculate. CO2 has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons for 12C) and two O (each 8 protons, 8 neutrons for 16O). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. So same number. So W could be CO2. Then Y could be a carbonate, like Na2CO3.

So, if X is HCl, Y is Na2CO3. Then the reaction would be HCl + Na2CO3 → 2NaCl + CO2↑ + H2O. The precipitate G would form only if something insoluble is formed. Wait, but HCl and Na2CO3 react to give NaCl (soluble), water, and CO2. No precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe Y is a sulfide? Like FeS. But that would produce H2S gas, which has 2 H (2 protons, 2 neutrons) and 1 S (16 protons, 16 neutrons for 32S). So total protons: 2+16=18, neutrons: 2+16=18. So yes, same number. So W could be H2S. Then X could be a strong acid like HCl reacting with FeS to produce H2S gas.

But then, what would the precipitate G be? FeCl2 is soluble. Hmm, doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe Y is an alcohol, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate. Wait, but if X is a metal, maybe reacting with something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a carbonate and a strong acid, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, going back to the product with the keto acid. X reacts with a keto acid to produce something with 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about what kind of reaction would that be. Keto acids are typically alpha-keto acids, like acetoacetic acid. If X is a base like NaOH, then the reaction would be neutralization: acetoacetic acid + NaOH → sodium salt + water. The product would be sodium 3-keto butanoate, which has a structure with O from the acid and the hydroxide.

But how does that relate to the number of oxygen atoms? The product has 2 O atoms. Let's see: the keto acid has, for example, two carbonyl groups. So when it reacts with a base like NaOH, each carboxylic acid group would lose a proton and gain an OH- as a base. So the product would have more oxygen. Wait, but the problem says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the product would have more O.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Maybe X is a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is PCl5, which is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. PCl5 can dehydrate keto acids to form anhydrides. But then, how does that fit into the other parts?

Wait, PCl5 is a solid, not a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, X could be SOCl2, which is a liquid. SOCl2 is used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. But how would that react with a keto acid? It would produce an acid chloride. The product would have more Cl but I'm not sure about O count.

Wait, maybe X is a metal that reacts with a keto acid. For example, if X is Na, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, then the reaction would produce Na+ and the conjugate base. But the product would have more O atoms, not less.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's approach it differently. Let's think about the possible candidates for X. The question says that X and its analogs are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like SOCl2, PCl5, NaOH, H2SO4, etc.

Wait, maybe X is sodium hydroxide (NaOH). It's a strong base, used in many reactions. So, when NaOH reacts with a keto acid, like acetoacetic acid, it would neutralize it to form the sodium salt. The product would be sodium 3-oxobutanoate, which has the formula C4H5O5Na. Wait, but the product is supposed to have 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent, like H2SO4. When H2SO4 reacts with a keto acid, it might dehydrate it, but I'm not sure how that would form a product with only 2 O atoms.

Wait, another possibility: Let's think about the product of X and a keto acid having 2 O atoms. Maybe it's something like CO2? No, that's a gas. Or perhaps it's H2O, but that's a liquid. Wait, but the product is the result of the reaction. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone, but then O count would be one.

Wait, maybe the product is a carbonyl compound. For example, if X is a reducing agent, like LiAlH4, but that's a solid. Alternatively, if X is a dehydrating agent, like P2O5, but that's a solid.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the initial reaction: X reacts with Y (liquid) to release H2 gas (so W is H2), and forms a precipitate G. Then G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K (about 4°C). So B is likely to be a solid at room temperature, melting just above 0°C. Hmm...

Wait, another thought: If Y is a carbonate solution (like sodium carbonate), and X is something like HCl gas, but that wouldn't produce a precipitate. Alternatively, X is a metal that reacts with water, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate, and Y is HCl. But then the reaction would produce CO2 and HCl would form HCl gas. Hmm, but the precipitate wouldn't form unless it's another product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a sulfide and an acid. For example, FeS reacting with HCl to produce FeCl2, H2S gas. But FeCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a nitride. For example, Mg3N2 reacting with water to produce NH3 gas. But then W would be NH3. Let's check: NH3 has 1 N (14 protons, 14 neutrons?) Wait, N is 7 protons, 7 neutrons for 14N. So each molecule of NH3 has 14 protons and 14 neutrons (14 from N, 3*1 from H). So yes, same number. So W could be NH3.

So if X is a nitride, like Mg3N2, and Y is water. Reaction: Mg3N2 + 6 H2O → 3 Mg(OH)2 (which is a precipitate) + 2 NH3↑. Then when Mg(OH)2 is heated, it might decompose into MgO and H2O. But I'm not sure about the melting point of MgO. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else.

Wait, the precipitate G is heated to release B. If G is Mg(OH)2, heating it might not release a new substance, but perhaps decompose into MgO and water. But then B would be MgO, whose melting point is very high, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe G is something else. Let me think about another possibility. If X is Na2CO3, and Y is H2SO4. Then the reaction would be Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. But CO2 is the gas, which fits the neutrons and protons condition (as discussed earlier). The precipitate would be nothing since all products are soluble. So that doesn't fit the problem's scenario.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. Suppose X is CaCO3, Y is HCl. Then, the reaction would produce CO2 gas and CaCl2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Doesn't fit.

Another thought: Maybe the reaction is between a metal hydroxide and an acid. For example, NaOH reacting with HCl. But that's a neutralization reaction, which produces NaCl and water, no gas. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe X is a sulfite. Reacting with an acid would produce SO2 gas. Let's check: SO2 has 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) = 30 protons and 16 + 2*8=30 neutrons. So yes, same number. So W could be SO2.

If X is Na2SO3, and Y is HCl. The reaction would be Na2SO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + SO2↑. The precipitate would be nothing because everything is soluble. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a compound that when reacted with X produces a sulfite. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps W is CO gas. Let's check: CO has 6 protons (C) and 7 neutrons (if it's 13C), but wait, the question says W's molecule has same number of neutrons and protons in total. So CO has 6+14=20 protons (since O is 8, but wait no, wait:

Wait, each molecule of W has: total protons equal to total neutrons. Let me compute for CO. C has 6 protons, O has 8. So total protons: 6+8=14. Neutrons: C is 6 (if 12C), O is 8 (16O). So total neutrons: 6+8=14. So yes, same. So W could be CO.

So if X is a metal carbonate, reacting with HCl would produce CO2, but we've already considered that.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the precipitate G and what it could be. When heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So B is a solid that melts just above 0°C. What substances have that melting point? Maybe something like ammonium nitrate? No, that's more like 180°C. Wait, maybe something else.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Perhaps I should think about what B is. If B is a basic oxide, maybe. Or perhaps it's a carbonate that decomposes upon heating. Wait, if G is a carbonate, heating it might release CO2. For example, CaCO3 → CaO + CO2↑ when heated. But CaO has a melting point around 2570°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride. Wait, no, NH4Cl decomposes at around 340°C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is something like glucose? No, but glucose is a solid, but I don't think it has a melting point that low. Alternatively, maybe it's a different substance.

Alternatively, perhaps B is something inert, like a noble gas. But noble gases are gases, not solids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a bicarbonate. For example, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) has a melting point around 270°C. No, that's much higher than 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. So perhaps B is something like ice? No, because ice melts at 273 K, which is close. 273 K is 0°C. So B's melting point is very close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. So maybe B is a different form of ice or something similar, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different compound. Maybe it's a salt that has a low melting point. For instance, some salts like Na2CO3·10H2O (a decahydrate) has a melting point around 277 K? Not sure.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the cumulative atomic masses in X. The question asks for the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X must have at least two different elements.

Wait, if X is a compound with two elements, say A and B, where A is light and B is heavy, and considering their isotopes. For example, if X is HCl, then H is light, Cl is heavier. But HCl is a gas, and the question says X is a substance, which might be a solid or liquid. Alternatively, if X is NaCl, which is a solid. But in that case, the isotopes would be for Na and Cl. But Na has a heavier isotope, like Na-23 (composed of 11 protons, 12 neutrons), and Cl-35 (17 protons, 18 neutrons). But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the options given for the cumulative atomic masses: 35, 25, 31, 29.

Hmm, let's think about possible pairs. For instance, if X is HCl, then the lightest element is H (atomic mass ~1), heaviest is Cl (~35.5). Sum is about 36.5, but the options are 35, etc. Not matching exactly, but perhaps if considering exact masses or specific isotopes. Alternatively, maybe X is NaOH, which has Na (~23), O (~16), H (~1). The lightest is H, heaviest is Na. Sum is 24. But option B is 25, which is close but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If X is H2O, which has H and O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not matching the options. So perhaps not.

Wait, let me think about the other parts again. The product of X and a keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. Suppose X is a base, like NaOH. The reaction would produce a salt and water. For example, if the keto acid is CH3COCH2COOH (citric acid?), which has multiple O. But the product would have more O, not 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is something like H2O. But that would require X to react in a way that produces water and another product with 2 O, which doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like H2SO4. When it reacts with a keto acid, maybe it dehydrates it, producing an anhydride. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid, the product could be an anhydride with fewer O. But I'm not sure.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options for the cumulative atomic masses. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If I think about the elements in X, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule. For example, H2O would have H (1) and O (16). Sum is 17. No.

Wait, X is a substance with a heavier isotope. Let's think of elements with heavier isotopes. For example, Cl has a common isotope at 35 and 37. Suppose X is Cl2, but that's a diatomic gas. But the problem states that X is a substance, not necessarily a diatomic gas.

Wait, another angle: Let's think about the cumulative atomic masses. The sum of the lightest and heaviest elements. Suppose X is NaCl. Na has atomic mass ~23, Cl ~35.5. Sum is 58.5. Not matching the options. Hmm.

Wait, what if X is HCl? Then H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum is about 36.5. Closest option is 35 (option A). But let's check the other conditions.

But earlier I thought W was H2, but if X is HCl, reacting with Y (maybe water?), perhaps HCl + H2O doesn't produce a gas. Unless Y is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is something like NH4Cl. It's a solid, and when reacted with something, it releases HCl gas. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NH3. Wait, no, because it's a gas.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think about the reaction again. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, same number of protons and neutrons. If W is CO2, as discussed earlier, then X could be a carbonate. But then the precipitate doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps W is O2. Each O2 molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same. So W could be O2, but that's unlikely because a violent reaction with a liquid would more likely produce H2.

Wait, perhaps W is N2? Each N2 molecule has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Yes, same. But how would that form from a reaction?

Hmm, maybe the reaction is between a nitride and an acid. For example, Mg3N2 + HCl → MgCl2 + NH4Cl. But no gas produced.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me think about the options for the cumulative sum:

Option A: 35 → perhaps Cl (35.5) and something else. But 35.5 is almost 35.

Wait, what if X is Cl2? Then the lightest and heaviest are both Cl. So sum is 35.5 + 35.5 = 71. Not matching.

Another angle: Maybe X is a compound with two elements, and their atomic masses sum to one of the options.

Option D is 29. So 29 could be from, say, Mg (24.3) and O (16). 24.3 +16=40.3, which doesn't fit. Or, maybe Na (23) and O (16), sum 39. Not matching. Hmm.

Option B is 25: perhaps C (12) and O (16), sum 28? Close, but not exactly. Or maybe something else.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think about the possible X first.

X is a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, HCl, PCl5, SOCl2, etc.

Wait, SOCl2 is a liquid. It's used to convert carboxylic acids to acid chlorides. So when SOCl2 reacts with a carboxylic acid (which is a keto acid if it's an alpha-keto acid), the product would be an acid chloride plus SO2 and HCl gases. Wait, but the product in this case would have more Cl and less O. Wait, but the problem says the product has 2 atoms of O. Hmm.

Wait, for example, if the keto acid is RCOOH, and reacts with SOCl2, the product would be RCOCl, SO2, and HCl. So the product RCOCl has only one O. But the question says the product has 2 O atoms. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps another reaction. If X is H2SO4, and reacts with a keto acid, perhaps it dehydrates it. For example, if the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH, then H2SO4 might dehydrate it to form an anhydride. The product would have more O, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is CO2. But that would mean X is a carbonate. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like CH3COCH2COOH, which would react to form Na+ and the conjugate base. But the product would have more O.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking back, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If X is HCl, the sum would be H (1) and Cl (35.5), totaling ~36.5. Closest option is 35 (A). But I'm not sure if the other conditions fit.

Alternatively, if X is NaOH, sum is Na (23) and O (16), totaling 39. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is NH3. But that's a gas, and the sum is N (14) + H (1) =15, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a liquid. But the problem says X has a heavier isotope. Acetic acid has C, H, O. Carbon has isotopes. But the sum of lightest and heaviest would be H (1) and O (16), sum 17. Not matching.

Wait, another thought: The problem says X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps X is a compound where one element is a heavy isotope. For example, Cl-35 instead of Cl-37. But that might not change the sum much.

Wait, going back to the reaction: If X is a carbonate, Y is HCl. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, which fits the W condition. Then, the precipitate would be HCl salt, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if Y is a metal, but that doesn't fit with Y being a liquid.

Another angle: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B with melting point ~277 K. 277 K is about 4°C. So B is a solid that melts just above 0°C. One possibility is ice, but ice's melting point is 273 K. So B is close to that. Maybe it's a different form of water or a hydrated salt.

Wait, perhaps B is a hydrate. For example, sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na2CO3·10H2O) has a melting point around 277 K. I think I've heard that before. So if that's the case, then when G is heated, it loses water and forms anhydrous Na2CO3, releasing H2O as vapor or something. But the question says B is released, which is a solid? Or maybe B is H2O? Not sure.

Wait, if G is Na2CO3·10H2O, heating it would dehydrate to Na2CO3 and release H2O. But H2O is a liquid, not a solid, and its melting point is 273 K. So perhaps B is H2O.

Wait, but B is the product of heating G. If G is a hydrate, heating would release H2O (as vapor), but B is a solid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into CO2 and a metal oxide. But the metal oxide would be B. I'm not sure about the melting point of that.

This is getting too time-consuming. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options and the information given.

Given that, perhaps X is NaOH. The sum of lightest (H, 1) and heaviest (Na, 23) is 24. But option B is 25. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe X is NH3? No, it's a gas.

Wait, perhaps X is H2O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not matching any options.

Another thought: If X is NH4Cl, sum of N (14) and Cl (35.5) is 49.5. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid). Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum is 13. Not matching.

Alternatively, X is HCl. Sum of H (1) and Cl (35.5) is 36.5. Closest option is 35 (A). But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps X is NaCl. Sum of Na (23) and Cl (35.5) is 58.5. Not matching.

Wait, another possibility: X is H2S. Lightest H (1), heaviest S (32). Sum is 33. Not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the product of X with a keto acid has 2 O atoms. Let's think about that. If the product is H2O, which has 2 O atoms, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl compound like an aldehyde or ketone. But those have one O.

Wait, maybe X is a reducing agent. For example, LiAlH4. But that's a solid, and the sum would be Li (7) and Al (27), sum 34. Close to option C (31), but not quite.

Alternatively, X is PCl5. Sum of P (31) and Cl (35.5). 31 +35.5=66.5. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let me think about the initial reaction again.

Violently reacts with liquid Y → produces H2 gas (W). Then, precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B, with a melting point near 277 K. So, G is likely a carbonate or hydroxide.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. Let's say it's Mg. Mg reacts with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas. The precipitate would be nothing, as MgCl2 is soluble. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is CaCO3. Y is HCl. Reaction: CaCO3 + 2 HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. Precipitate is nothing, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of B first. If B's melting point is near 277 K, it's close to 0°C. So perhaps B is a salt with a low melting point. One such salt is Na2CO3·10H2O, which I think has a melting point around 277 K. So if G is Na2CO3·10H2O, heating it would release water vapor and form Na2CO3. But then, when X reacts with Y, what is that reaction?

Wait, perhaps Y is water, and X is Na2CO3·10H2O. Then, when heated, it loses water. But that doesn't involve a reaction with a liquid to produce a gas.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible options again. The sum of lightest and heaviest elements in X is one of 35, 25, 31, 29.

Option C is 31. What elements sum to 31? Let's see:

N (14) + O (17) = 31. So if X contains N and O, their sum is 31. So X could be NO, but that's a gas. Or maybe a compound like NH3, but sum is 14 +1 =15. Hmm, no.

Wait, another possibility: If X is COCl2. Then C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 47.5. Not matching.

Alternatively, if X is NO2, which has N (14) and O (16), sum 30. Close to option D (29).

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements like O and S. O (16) and S (32). Sum 48. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm not getting anywhere. I think I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the options, perhaps the correct cumulative sum is 35 (option A), which would correspond to H and Cl in HCl. So X is HCl, which is a liquid under certain conditions? Wait, no, HCl is a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is H2SO4. Sum of H (1) and S (32) is 33, not matching. O is 16, but H is lighter.

Wait, another thought. The problem says the substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. One such reagent is H2SO4, but that's a strong acid. Alternatively, it could be something like DMSO (used as a polar aprotic solvent), but that's more of a solvent than a reagent.

Alternatively, perhaps X is THF (tetrahydrofuran), but that's not a reagent per se, more of a solvent.

Wait, another possibility: X is a heavy water isotope, like D2O. But that's not a common reagent, and the sum would be D (2) and O (16), sum 18. Not matching.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted my options. Based on the earlier thoughts, I'll settle on option A) 35, thinking that X might be HCl, where H is 1 and Cl is 35.5, summing to about 36.5, but the closest option is 35.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W (with equal numbers of protons and neutrons) and forms a precipitate G. Heating G releases B, a solid with a melting point near 277 K (~4°C). Additionally, the reaction of X with a keto acid produces a product containing 2 oxygen atoms, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include H₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons), CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons), or N₂ (14 protons, 14 neutrons). H₂ is a likely candidate, as it is commonly released in reactions involving metals and acids.

2. **Precipitate G and B**: G forms when X reacts with Y and releases B upon heating. B has a melting point near 277 K, suggesting it is a solid that melts just above 0°C. One possibility is sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na₂CO₃·10H₂O), which has a melting point close to 277 K. This implies G could be a hydrated salt that dehydrates upon heating.

3. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X and a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests X might be a base or a dehydrating agent. For example, if X is NaOH, it could neutralize a keto acid to form a salt with a specific oxygen count.

4. **Cumulative Atomic Masses in X**: X must contain at least two elements, one of which has a heavier isotope. Considering the options:
   - **Option A (35)**: Likely corresponds to H and Cl in HCl (H = 1, Cl = 35.5). HCl is a reagent in organic chemistry, and its isotopes align with the problem's description.
   - **Option B (25)**: Could correspond to C (12) and O (16), but this does not fit the reaction conditions.
   - **Option C (31)**: Could correspond to P (31) and another element, but this does not align with the reaction or reagent properties.
   - **Option D (29)**: Could correspond to Al (27) and another element, but this does not fit the conditions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible candidate for X is HCl, where the lightest element (H) and the heaviest element (Cl) sum to approximately 36.5. The closest option is **35**, making **Option A** the best choice.
