Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A and leading through several steps to compound D. My goal is to identify what compound D is, and then choose the correct option from A to D.

Starting with compound A: The proton NMR shows two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the number of protons and their splitting patterns can give information about the structure.

Looking at the triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm. Triplets usually come from coupling with two neighboring protons. 0.9 ppm is typically where methyl groups attached to something like CH₂ groups are. So maybe those 6H are from two methyl groups each attached to a CH₂. Because 2 methyl groups (each with 3H) would give 6H.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each proton is next to three others. At 1.3 ppm, that's usually around where methylene groups (CH₂) are. So maybe this is a CH₂ group attached to another CH₂. Wait, but 4H might mean two CH₂ groups? Or perhaps a single CH₂ connected to something else that has more protons.

Wait, let me think. The triplet and quartet: in an NMR, adjacent groups cause splitting. So the triplet probably comes from a CH₂ group next to another CH₂. Because if two adjacent CH₂ groups, each with 2 protons, their coupling would give a quartet for each. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let's think again.

If a CH₂ group is next to another CH₂, each proton in the first CH₂ would see two protons in the adjacent CH₂. So each proton would split into a triplet. But the integration is 6H for the triplet. That suggests three CH₂ groups? No, wait, the integration is for the number of protons. So if there's a triplet integrating to 6H, that would be two methyl groups (each 3H) attached to a CH₂. Because each CH₂ has
