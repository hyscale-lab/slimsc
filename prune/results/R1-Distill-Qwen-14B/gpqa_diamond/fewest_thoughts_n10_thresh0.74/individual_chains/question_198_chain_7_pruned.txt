Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate (SCN-). The total concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D, with some percentages.

Hmm. So I remember that stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. A higher β means the complex is more stable because it forms more readily. The β values here are for complexes with increasing numbers of SCN- ligands. So the first complex is Co(SCN)1^+, then Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4^2-.

Wait, but the problem mentions "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. Dithiocyanato would be with two SCN- ions. So which complex is that? I think the blue one is the tetrahedral Co(SCN)_2^2+ ion, which is called the cobalt(II) dithiocyanate. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact complexes. Alternatively, maybe the blue complex is the one with more SCN- ligands. Or perhaps the problem is referring to the first dithiocyanato complex, which would be the second complex in the series (β2=40). Hmm, the question says "blue dithiocyanato" which I think is the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ complex. I've heard that the color changes with the number of ligands, so I think that's the correct one.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the β values. The β values are for each step. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex: Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)^+ (that's a +1 charge because Co is +2 and SCN is -1 each. So one SCN gives Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co
