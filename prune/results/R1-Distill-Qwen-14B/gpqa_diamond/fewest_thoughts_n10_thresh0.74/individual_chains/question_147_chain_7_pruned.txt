Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, the question is about finding the velocity of particle A when a proton and antiproton annihilate each other. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each of charge + and -. The mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. Wait, but I'm more familiar with masses in terms of rest mass energy, so that's the energy when the particle is at rest.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that means its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Or wait, maybe it's just moving with a low velocity, so relativistic effects might be minimal. But I'm not entirely sure yet.

Wait, but in annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Also, since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, their combined energy and momentum will determine the properties of the resulting particles.

Let me think about the initial setup. The proton is probably at rest, given that the antiproton is moving slowly. Or wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, so maybe the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity, but low. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's velocity is small compared to c.

Wait, but I think the problem states that the antipro
