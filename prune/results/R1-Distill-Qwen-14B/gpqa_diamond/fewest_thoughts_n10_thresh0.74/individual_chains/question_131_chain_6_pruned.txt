Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading through the question carefully.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. This acid undergoes dehydration to form an anhydride. The anhydride has specific NMR characteristics: a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, with molecular formula C13H16O3.

The next part is about the 2D NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is asking which two resonances are connected in the major product's spectrum.

First, I'll try to break down each part of the problem.

Starting with the dicarboxylic acid. It's a cis-alkene, so the two carboxylic acid groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. When dehydrated, this forms an anhydride. Dehydration typically leads to loss of water and the formation of a double bond between the two carbonyl groups, but wait, in an anhydride formation from a dicarboxylic acid, it's more about forming a cyclic structure with two carbonyls connected by an oxygen.

Wait, no. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride, which is a cyclic structure where two acid groups lose a water molecule each and form a ring. So, for a cis-alkene, the starting diacid would have substituents on either side of the double bond.

But wait, the starting material is a cis-alkene, so the two substituents (the COOH groups) are on the same side of the double bond. When dehydrated, that would form an anhydride where the two carbonyls are connected by a single bond, perhaps in a ring structure.

But maybe I should think about the structure of the anhydride. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons usually show up, but wait, waitâ€”7 ppm is also where vinylic protons in some cases might appear. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring, but if the original diacid didn't have any aromatic rings, maybe the anhydride has a new ring structure.

Wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene, so that's a non-aromatic part. So when it dehydrates, the anhydride would have a structure where the two carbonyl groups are connected via an oxygen bridge. Wait, no, perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride, like a five-membered ring. So the two carboxylic acid groups are adjacent, and the dehydration forms a ring. But the starting diacid has a cis double bond, so after dehydration, the structure would have a ring with a double
