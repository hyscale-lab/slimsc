Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. 

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So first, I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means this state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That's helpful because it should simplify some calculations.

Let me write down the P_z matrix. From the question, P_z has the first row as (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So in matrix form, it's diagonal with elements ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

Since the state is given in the same basis as P_z's eigenvectors, the components of the state vector correspond directly to the eigenvalues of P_z. So each component of the state vector is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate of P_z.

The state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, but I should probably normalize this vector to make sure it's a valid quantum state. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components.

( (-1/2)^2 ) + ( (1/sqrt(2))^2 ) + ( (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) + 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Oh, it's already normalized. Great, so no need to adjust anything there.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. Since the state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, the expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

Each component of the state gives the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate. So the state can be written as a linear combination of the P_z eigenstates |z=+ħ⟩, |z=0⟩, and |z=-ħ⟩.

So, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is:

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = ( (-1/2) * ħ ) + ( (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 ) + ( (-1/2) * (-ħ) ).

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-1/2) * ħ = - ħ/2.

Second term: (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (-1/2) * (-ħ) = ħ/2.

Adding them up: (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2) = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element. So P_z² has diagonal entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2. So it's diag(ħ², 0, ħ²).

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by the square of the eigenvalues.

So each term is:

| (-1/2) |^2 * (ħ^2) + | (1/sqrt(2)) |^2 * 0 + | (-1/2) |^2 * (ħ^2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Second term: (1/2) * 0 = 0.

Third term: (1/4) * ħ² = ħ²/4.

Adding them together: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (ħ²)(1/2).

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, it simplifies to sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ ), which is sqrt( (ħ²/2) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches. So the uncertainty is ħ divided by the square root of 2. 

I think that's it. Let me just check if I did everything correctly. The state is in the P_z basis, so the expectation values are straightforward. The calculation of ⟨P_z⟩ being zero makes sense because the positive and negative contributions cancel out. The ⟨P_z²⟩ part is correct because each term is squared, so the signs don't matter. The uncertainty comes out to option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value of $P_z$ ($\langle P_z \rangle$)
The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with the state vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix of $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar, 0, -\hbar$ along the diagonal. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of $P_z$, the expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of $P_z^2$ ($\langle P_z^2 \rangle$)
The matrix of $P_z^2$ is the square of the eigenvalues of $P_z$, giving diagonal entries $\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (\hbar^2) + \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 (0) + \left|-\frac{1}{2}\right|^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
