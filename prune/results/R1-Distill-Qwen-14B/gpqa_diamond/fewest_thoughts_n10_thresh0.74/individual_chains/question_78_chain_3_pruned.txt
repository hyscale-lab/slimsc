Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields. And these fields can be described using scalar and vector potentials, right?

The question is asking about the expressions for the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain point r and time t. The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the fields at a later time when t > tr, where tr is the time when the field was generated.

Wait, the options all have different forms, so I need to think about how V and A are derived. I recall that the scalar potential for a static charge is straightforward, like Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the motion's effects on the field.

Oh right, in the case of a moving charge, you have to consider the retarded time. The fields aren't just what they were at the current time because the information propagates at the speed of light. So the potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time, specifically tr = t - r/c, where r is the distance from the charge to the observation point.

But wait, the problem defines d as the vector from the charge's position at time tr to the observation point r. So d is the displacement vector between the charge's position at tr and the field point. So the distance between them is |d|, which I can call d, but perhaps it's more accurate to denote it as |d|.

Wait, in the options, I see terms like (d c - d·v) appearing in the denominators. Oh, because in the expressions for potentials when considering motion, especially in a relativistic context, you get terms involving the velocity of the charge and the direction of d.

Let me think about the scalar potential. The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by Jefimenko's equations, I think. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(r - (v t)/(c²))) ), but wait, perhaps more accurately, it's V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d + v t')]/(c²), where t' is the time factor. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the retarded time.

Wait, no. The correct expressions involve the charge's velocity and the vector from the charge's position at tr to the current point. So the scalar potential at time t would be something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d + (v × something))]. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, in the problem, the vector d is defined from the charge's position at tr to the field point r, so d = r - s(tr), where s(tr) is the position at time tr. So the distance is |d|, but also, the charge's velocity at tr is v.

The potentials are calculated from the charge's position and velocity at tr, so the scalar potential for a moving charge would
