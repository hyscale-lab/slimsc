Okay, so I have this question about stars and parallax, and I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about parallax and how stars are distributed in the universe.

Parallax is a measure of how much a star appears to shift its position in the sky as observed from Earth. The formula I remember is that the distance d to a star in parsecs is inversely proportional to its parallax plx, so d = 1/plx. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes, meaning their position shifts more as we orbit the Sun.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, but if they're uniformly distributed, does that mean their actual distances are uniform too? Or are they uniformly spread out in space? Oh, wait, I think when they say uniformly distributed, it refers to the density of stars in space being uniform. So, the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance. So, more distant regions have more stars, but each unit volume has the same number of stars.

So, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit parallax interval changes with plx. Let's think about this in terms of the volume of space at a certain distance.

The number of stars in a given volume depends on the volume. Since density is uniform, the number of stars is proportional to the volume. So if I can find how the volume relates to the parallax, I can find how the number of stars per unit parallax changes.

What's the volume around the Sun up to a distance d? Well, volume is 4/3 π d³. But wait, when considering a thin shell at distance d, the volume would be the surface area of a sphere times a small thickness δd. Surface area is 4π d², so the volume is 4π d² δd.

But since d = 1/plx, substituting that in, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)² δ(1/plx). Let me see, δd would be the change in distance. Wait, but we need to relate this to a change in parallax. Let's say the parallax changes by δplx. Since d = 1/plx, δd = - (1/plx²) δplx. Because derivative of 1/plx is -1/(plx²) times δplx.

So, the volume for a thin shell at distance d with thickness δd is 4 π d² δd. Substitute d =1/plx, and δd = -δplx/(plx²). The volume becomes 4 π (1/plx²) * (-δplx)/(plx²). Wait, but the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but when considering the absolute volume, we can ignore the sign.

So, Volume = 4 π (1/plx²) * (δplx)/(plx²) ) = 4 π δplx / plx^4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me go through that again. If δd is the thickness, and we have d = 1/plx, then δd = - (1/(plx²)) δplx.

So, the volume of the shell is 4 π d² δd. Substituting:

4
