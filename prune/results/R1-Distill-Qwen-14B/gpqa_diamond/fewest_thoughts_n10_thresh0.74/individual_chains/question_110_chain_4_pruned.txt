Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be observed by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I'll read the question again. It says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, brighter than 17. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to V=17. HIRES can go brighter than 16 mag. So anything with V mag less than or equal to 16 can be seen by HIRES. Wait, wait, no, because the wording is "brighter than 16 V mag," meaning m_V < 16. So, for a star to be visible to both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 (since HIRES can't see beyond that) and ≤17 (because ESPRESSO can't see beyond that). But wait, wait, that's not right. Let me think again. If ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means m_V ≤17 because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. Similarly, HIRES can observe up to m_V ≤16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if it's brighter than 16, it's also brighter than 17, so both can
