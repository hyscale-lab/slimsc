Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions are when an acid reacts with a base to form water and a salt. And the enthalpy change for these reactions is often measured in kilojoules per mole. 

The question gives me three solutions being mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, but wait, when you mix an acid with a base, they'll neutralize each other. But I need to figure out how they all react together.

First, the volumes and molarities are given. Let me write them down:

HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base. Because the neutralization reaction depends on the amounts of H+ and OH- ions.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, each mole gives two H+ ions. But wait, wait—a 0.3 M solution? So each liter gives 0.3 moles H2SO4, which would contribute 0.6 moles H+ per liter. Oh wait no, actually, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid but the second dissociation isn't as complete. Wait, no, for strong acids, both H+ are released. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in the first dissociation but the second is weak, right? Or is it that concentrated solutions might not fully dissociate? Hmm, this could complicate things. But wait, in neutralization calculations, especially when dealing with dilute solutions, sometimes we assume complete dissociation. Alternatively, maybe in this problem, it's considered that H2SO4 provides two H+ ions per mole, regardless of the strength.

Hmm. So I think the question assumes that H2SO4 completely donates both H+ ions. But wait, no, wait—H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first H+ but the second H+ isn't as strong. So in a solution, the first H+ is fully ionized, but the second is only partially. But I'm not sure if that matters here. Since the problem is about enthalpy of neutralization, perhaps it's okay to assume that all H+ from the acids are available for reaction. Alternatively, maybe the solution considers H2SO4 as providing 2 H+ per mole, regardless.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to find the total equivalents of H+ from the acids and the total equivalents of OH- from the base, then determine which is in excess.

So first, let's find the moles of each acid and base.

For HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 moles HCl. Since it's HCl, each mole gives 1 H+.

For H2SO4: 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles H+.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of Ba(OH)2: 200 mL is 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, so H+ is 0.28 moles, OH- is 0.2 moles. So the OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react with H+.

When H+ reacts with OH-, each pair makes water and releases or absorbs enthalpy. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which has a ΔH of approximately -57.3 kJ per mole. But wait, I should remember that this is the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base, like HCl and NaOH. 

But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So when it reacts with a base, the first H+ is as strong as HCl, and the second is weaker. But in the neutralization, the strong H+ will react completely, and the weaker ones may not. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of all H+ from the acids as available. So 0.28 moles H+ will react with 0.2 moles OH-. So 0.2 moles of H+ will be neutralized, leaving 0.08 moles of H+ unused. But wait, wait, because the OH- is 0.2, so H+ will be consumed by 0.2, leaving 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles H+.

Wait, but that's only part of the H+ from H2SO4? Let me see. So H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles of H+. HCl contributes 0.1. So when OH- neutralizes 0.2 moles of H+, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

So the reaction would go as far as the OH- allows. So after reaction:

H+ consumed: 0.2 moles.

H+ left: 0.08 moles.

So the enthalpy change would be based on the H+ neutralized, which is 0.2 moles.

Each mole of H+ neutralization releases 57.3 kJ (since ΔH is -57.3 kJ/mol). So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let's check the options:

Options are A, B, C in kcal, D in kJ.

But wait, wait: the question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization." Wait, is the question asking for the total enthalpy change when these solutions are mixed, or the enthalpy per mole of reaction?

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually expressed per mole of H+ or per mole of reaction. So in this case, the amount would be based on the moles of H+ neutralized.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy is per mole of H+ or per mole of H2O formed.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is for the reaction H+ (aq) + OH- (aq) → H2O(l), ΔH = -57.3 kJ/mol.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting would release 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

But the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

So 11.46 kJ is approximately 11.46 kJ, which is about -11.46 kJ. But option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the moles of H+ and OH-.

Let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 0.5 L * 0.2 mol/L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L * 0.3 mol/L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ = 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L * 0.5 mol/L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So OH- is 0.2 mol. So H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol. Enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have exactly that, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Oh wait, because the answer is in kcal, not kJ. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the question is using cal instead of kJ.

Wait, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.66 kcal (since 57.3 /4.184 ≈13.66). So per mole of H+, the enthalpy is -13.66 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * 13.66 ≈ 2.732 kcal. But wait, no, because 57.3 kJ is about 13.66 kcal (since 57.3 * 1000 cal / 4184 ≈13.66). So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.66 = ~2.73 kcal. But the options are A) -2.72 kcal, which is close.

Wait, but this approach leads to enthalpy being -2.73 kcal, and option A is -2.72 kcal. That's very close. So perhaps that's the answer. But why is the other approach giving me -11.46 kJ, which is about -11.42 kcal (since 11.46 * 1000 /4184 = about 2.74 kcal? Wait no, wait. 11.46 kJ is 11460 J, which is 11460 /4184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So 2.736 kcal, which is approximately 2.74 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is close.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization when these solutions are mixed. So perhaps I should consider that the total reaction produces a certain amount of water, and calculate the enthalpy accordingly.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and base is about -57.3 kJ/mol for each mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. But none of the options except D is in kJ, but D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy, such as -57.3 kJ per mole of H2O formed. Since each H+ and OH- makes one H2O. So 0.2 moles of H2O would be 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ. 

Wait, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the problem expects the answer in kJ, but the options have a different value. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles.

Wait, maybe I messed up the H2SO4 contribution. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so in the first dissociation, it gives two H+? Or one?

Wait, H2SO4 as a strong acid in the first H+ and weak in the second. So in solution, the first H+ is fully ionized, but the second is only partially. But when neutralizing, perhaps only the first H+ is considered.

Wait, that complicates things. Because if H2SO4 only donates one H+ fully, and the second is weak, then in the reaction with OH-, perhaps only the first H+ reacts.

So, for H2SO4: 0.09 mol. Each gives one H+ (the first), so 0.09 mol H+. The second H+ might not react as much.

But then, the total H+ from HCl is 0.1, H2SO4 (first H+) is 0.09, so total H+ is 0.19.

Then, OH- is 0.2 mol.

So 0.19 H+ reacts with 0.19 OH-, leaving 0.01 OH-.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because OH- is more than H+ in that case. Hmm, no, if H+ is 0.19 and OH- is 0.2, then OH- is in excess by 0.01.

Wait, but that's more complicated. I think the initial approach is correct, considering both H+ from H2SO4 as available for neutralization. But perhaps the problem assumes H2SO4 only donates one H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats H2SO4 as a strong acid, giving both H+ ions. So the initial approach holds.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. But given the options, the initial approach gave me 0.2 moles of H+ neutralization, leading to about -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.42 kcal (since 11.46 kJ is about 2.73 kcal, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 11.46 kJ is 11460 J, which is 11460 /4184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. But I thought the standard enthalpy is per mole of H+.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units. Let's think again.

Wait, the standard enthalpy is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal. But wait, -11.42 kcal is about -48.0 kJ (since 1 kcal is ~4.184 kJ, so 11.42 *4.184 ≈47.8 kJ). That's not matching with 11.46 kJ.

Wait, so there's a confusion here between per mole of H+ and per mole of reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total moles of H+ and OH- and using the neutralization value per mole of H2O.

Wait, another approach. The total reaction can be considered as the sum of the acid-base reactions.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + H2O

But perhaps this is more complicated. Let me try to write the reactions.

Each HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2:

HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

But wait, because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, each mole of Ba(OH)2 can neutralize two HCl molecules. Because Ba(OH)2 has two OH- ions.

Similarly, each H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions, so each mole can neutralize two moles of OH-.

So, perhaps I should calculate the stoichiometric amounts.

So for HCl and Ba(OH)2:

HCl: 0.1 mol
Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol

The reaction is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So each mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with 2 moles HCl. So 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 can react with 0.2 mol HCl. But HCl is only 0.1 mol, so HCl is the limiting reagent here. So all HCl reacts, and some Ba(OH)2 remains.

Wait, no, because 0.1 mol HCl can react with 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2. So let's see, which acid is in excess.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this by looking at the equivalents.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol OH-.

So the equivalents of HCl is 0.1, and Ba(OH)2 is 0.2. So HCl is limiting here. So all 0.1 mol H+ from HCl reacts with 0.1 mol OH- from Ba(OH)2. So after this, 0.2 -0.1 = 0.1 mol OH- remains.

Then, H2SO4 comes into play. H2SO4 has 0.18 mol H+.

The remaining OH- is 0.1 mol. So the H+ from H2SO4 will react with OH-.

But H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole can donate 2 H+. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

The remaining OH- is 0.1 mol, which will react with 0.1 mol H+. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18, but only 0.1 is needed.

So after reaction:

H2SO4: 0.09 mol → provides 0.18 H+. 0.1 reacts, 0.08 remains.

So total H+ neutralized: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.1 (from H2SO4) = 0.2 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ. But wait, the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, the options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

So option B is -11.42 kcal. But wait, -11.46 kJ is approximately -2.74 kcal (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ, so 11.46 kJ /4.184≈ 2.736 kcal). So the enthalpy change would be -2.74 kcal, which is close to option A (-2.72 kcal).

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the enthalpy per mole of H2O. Each mole of H+ neutralized produces 1 mole of H2O, releasing 57.3 kJ. So 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ. But the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for enthalpy, like -57.0 kJ/mol. Then, 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ, which is about -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles. Let me check moles again.

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 300 mL *0.3 = 0.09 mol. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL *0.5 M = 0.1 mol. Correct.

But wait, the reaction may proceed in steps. First, HCl reacts with Ba(OH)2, then H2SO4 reacts with any remaining Ba(OH)2.

Let me think about it.

Reaction 1: HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + H2O

The stoichiometry is 2 HCl + Ba(OH)2 → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

So 2 moles HCl react with 1 mole Ba(OH)2.

HCl has 0.1 mol. Ba(OH)2 has 0.1 mol.

So how much reacts?

Ba(OH)2 required for 0.1 HCl: (0.1 mol HCl) /2 = 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2.

So Ba(OH)2 is in excess by 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So after reaction 1:

HCl: 0.1 - 0.05 *2 = 0 (since 2 HCl per Ba(OH)2). So all HCl is used up.

Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.05 mol.

H2O produced: 0.05 *2 = 0.1 mol.

Now, H2SO4 is added. It will react with the remaining Ba(OH)2.

Reaction 2: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

The stoichiometry is 1 H2SO4 :1 Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 available: 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2 available: 0.05 mol.

So Ba(OH)2 is limiting. All 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 will react with 0.05 mol H2SO4.

So H2SO4 remaining: 0.09 -0.05 =0.04 mol.

BaSO4 produced: 0.05 mol.

H2O produced: 0.05 *2 =0.1 mol.

H2SO4 that's reacted: 0.05 mol, each providing 2 H+? Or only 1 H+?

Wait, in this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole Ba(OH)2, which has 2 OH-.

So the reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 donates 2 H+ to neutralize 2 OH-.

But considering enthalpy, each mole of H+ neutralization releases 57.3 kJ.

So total H+ neutralized in reaction 1: 0.05 mol Ba(OH)2 *2 OH- per mole =0.1 mol OH- → 0.1 mol H+ neutralized.

In reaction 2: 0.05 mol H2SO4 → 0.05 *2 =0.1 mol H+ neutralized (since each H2SO4 donates 2 H+ in the reaction).

So total H+ neutralized: 0.1 + 0.1 =0.2 mol.

Thus, enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the total H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.09 *2=0.18 mol.

Total H+ =0.28 mol.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.1 *2 =0.2 mol.

So H+ and OH- will neutralize each other:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total neutralization: 0.2 mol H+ and OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57.3) =-11.46 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that can't be right.

Wait, looking at the options again, option B is -11.42 kcal. But -11.46 kJ is about -2.74 kcal, so that's not matching. Unless I made a mistake in unit conversion.

Wait, no. Wait, 57.3 kJ per mole of H+ is the same as 57,300 J per mole. Since 1 kcal is about 4184 J, 57,300 J is approximately 13.66 kcal.

So 0.2 moles would be 0.2 *13.66 =2.73 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.73 kcal, which matches option A (-2.72 kcal).

Ah, okay, so perhaps the question is considering the total H+ neutralized as 0.2 moles, and each mole releases 57.3 kJ, which is about 13.66 kcal. So 0.2 *13.66=2.732 kcal, so approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So why did my initial approach with kJ not match? Because I thought the answer was -11.46 kJ, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is expecting the answer in kcal, not kJ.

Wait, but why would the problem present some options in kJ and others in kcal? That's confusing. But perhaps the correct approach is to calculate in kcal.

Wait, 57.3 kJ/mol is equivalent to 57.3 * 1000 cal/mol. 57300 cal = 57300 /4184 ≈13.66 kcal/mol.

So 0.2 moles → 2.732 kcal. So the answer is approximately -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but what about the H2SO4's second H+? Because in reality, the second H+ isn't fully ionized. So if H2SO4 only contributes 0.09 mol H+ (from the first dissociation), then total H+ would be 0.1 +0.09=0.19.

OH- is 0.2. So H+ neutralized is 0.19 mol. That would make the enthalpy change 0.19 * (-57.3) =-10.887 kJ, which is about -2.60 kcal.

That's not matching any options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the stoichiometric neutralization without considering the strength, treating all H+ as available.

In any case, considering the calculations, the initial approach leads to -2.72 kcal, which is option A. But others may think differently.

Wait, wait, another point: the volumes are given, but when the solutions are mixed, the total volume changes. Does that affect the calculation of concentrations? No, because we're calculating moles, which are independent of volume.

So, considering all that, I think the correct answer is option B, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Or is it option A?

Wait, no, because 0.2 moles of H+ neutralized gives 0.2 *57.3 =11.46 kJ, which is approximately 2.74 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close.

So I would go with option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.5 \, \text{L} \times 0.2 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).  
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{L} \times 0.3 \, \text{M} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{H}^+ \), so \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).  
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.2 \, \text{L} \times 0.5 \, \text{M} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of \( \text{OH}^- \), so \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).

3. **Determine the limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
   - \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH}^- \).  
   - \( \text{OH}^- \) is the limiting reactant, and \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) is neutralized.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is \( \Delta H = -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) for \( \text{H}^+ + \text{OH}^- \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \), the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

5. **Convert to kcal (if required):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).

6. **Compare with options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) is very close to the calculated value of \( -2.74 \, \text{kcal} \).  
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect because it misrepresents the unit conversion.  
   - Option C: \( -3.80 \, \text{kcal} \) is incorrect.  
   - Option D: \( -16.0 \, \text{kJ} \) is incorrect because it does not match the calculated \( -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **A**, as it aligns with the calculated enthalpy change when expressed in kcal.

Answer: A
