Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions starting from compound A. I need to follow each step and see how the compounds change. 

First, the reaction steps are as follows:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form E.

And there are some hints. Let's look at them.

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are usually used in Wittig reactions. So, A must be reacting via a Wittig reaction to form that compound. Wait, what's the structure of that product? Let me think.

The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is a substituted double bond. So, the parent ring is cyclopentane, with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and position 4 has the propan-2-ylidene group, which is like a substituted cyclopropane or a double bond with substituents.

Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene would be a methylene group attached to a propyl chain. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, maybe? Or perhaps it's (CH3)2C=CH-. No, wait, propan-2-ylidene is probably (CH2CH(CH3))=CH2? Or wait, maybe it's the structure where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3 of propane, but that's not right. Alternatively, propan-2-ylidene would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a methyl group on C2. So, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH3)- group attached to the cyclopentane ring.

So, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes. So, if compound A is the ylide partner, which would typically be an aldehyde or ketone, since Wittig reactions involve ylides reacting with carbonyl groups to form alkenes.

So, in the Wittig reaction, the product is an alkene. So, compound A must have a carbonyl group (like an aldehyde or ketone) because that's what the ylide attacks.

So, from the product structure, the cyclopentane ring has substituents. Let me imagine what the starting carbonyl compound would look like. The product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So, the substituents on the cyclopentane are at positions 1, 2, and 4. Positions 1 and 2 are methyl groups, and position 4 has the propan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, the Wittig reaction would take the carbonyl group, say R2C=O, and replace it with R2C=CH2 (depending on the ylide). Alternatively, if the ylide is R2P=CH-R', then it would form R2C=CH-R'. So, the carbonyl compound (A) would have a structure where, upon reaction with this ylide, the product would have the propan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the starting material for the Wittig. Let's say compound A is a cyclopentanone derivative. Because when it reacts with the ylide, it forms the alkene. 

Wait, but the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane... So, the starting material would have been a cyclopentanone with substituents. Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is between two methyl groups on the cyclopentane.

Alternatively, maybe the
