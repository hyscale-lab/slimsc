Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me think out loud, as it were.

Alright, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels when a star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm. So, the star's properties are given: radius 1.5 solar, mass 1.1 solar. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but then the star's photosphere is being considered. When the star has spots, the observed Teff decreases. That's because spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So, the spots are regions with lower temperature, and when a significant portion of the surface is covered, the average Teff drops.

Now, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The observed ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when it doesn't. Wait, no, let me read that again: 'the ratio decreases when the star has spots.' So R = N1/N2. So, when there are spots, R is lower. So without spots, R is higher.

We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So, the ratio when no spots (R1) divided by ratio when spots (R2) is the factor. Wait, the question says, 'the factor by which this ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.' So the factor is R1/R2.

Wait, but why does the ratio change? Because the temperature changes. Oh right, because the effective temperature of the photosphere affects the ionization and excitation states of atoms. Since we're dealing with the photosphere in LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the Boltzmann equation applies here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level,
