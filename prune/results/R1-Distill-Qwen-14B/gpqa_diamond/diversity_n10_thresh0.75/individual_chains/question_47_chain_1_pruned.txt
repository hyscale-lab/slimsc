Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the structure of the compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's see. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. That's nine carbons, eleven hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. 

Looking at the IR data first. They mention medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those usually indicate N-H stretches or maybe O-H. Wait, but the presence of a strong band at 1720 cm-1 is important. That's a strong carbonyl peak, which could be ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But considering the options, it's more likely an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR. Let's break it down. The signals are:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This seems like a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, probably in an ethyl group. Like OCH2CH3, so the ethyl ester maybe.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet, maybe an NH group? Or perhaps an OCH2. Wait, if it's an NH, but the integration is 2H, that doesn't make sense because NH is typically -NH- as one proton. Hmm, maybe it's an OCH2 group. Alternatively, maybe it's an NH2, but I don't see any other info pointing that way.

4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet suggests splitting into four, which is typical for a CH2 next to a CH3. So maybe this is OCH2 connected to another CH2. Wait, but in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to the oxygen is usually a quartet because of the adjacent CH3. Oh wait, maybe in an ester group like OCH2CH3, but the quartet would be on the OCH2. Let me think. The quartet at 4.5 ppm and 2Hâ€”maybe that's the OCH2 from an ester. So the ethyl ester would have the CH3 as triplet around 1.2, and the OCH2 as quartet around 4.5. But wait, the other peak at 4.0 is a singlet and broad, 2H. Hmm.

Then the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Because the coupling would be between adjacent protons; if it's para, each pair of protons would be a doublet, and they'd split each other that way.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group on the 3 position. So the benzamide would have a CONH2 group. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (amide). The NMR would have an ethoxy group as triplet for CH3 and quartet for OCH2. But the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.0 ppm as a singlet, maybe that's the NH2? Wait, but amide protons are usually broad and around 8-9 ppm, I think. Not sure if that matches here.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That's a formamide, so the structure is HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the carbonyl would be from formamide, which might have a lower carbonyl peak, maybe around 1680? But the IR here is 1720, which is more like an ester or ketone. Not sure. Also, in formamide, the NH would be around 8-9 ppm. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be a doublet each, para substitution. The ethoxy would be CH3 triplet and OCH2 quartet. But then where is the formamide NH? Maybe in the NMR, that's the broad peak at 4.0 ppm. But wait, formamide's NH is usually around 8.5 ppm or so, but maybe in this molecule, it's somewhere else. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would be an amino group on the benzene ring (para to the propionate ester). So the structure would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene, with an NH2 group. So the NMR would have an amino group. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (ester) at 1720. The
