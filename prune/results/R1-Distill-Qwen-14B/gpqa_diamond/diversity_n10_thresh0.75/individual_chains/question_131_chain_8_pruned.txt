Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a reaction involving a dicarboxylic acid, dehydration to form an anhydride, and then a reaction with tetramethylcyclopentadiene. The products are two, and their NMR data are given. The main clue is the NOESY spectrum, which tells us about spatial proximity of protons.

First, let's start with the initial part. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydration of a cis-dicarboxylic acid would typically form an anhydride. Wait, no, wait. Dehydration usually forms an anhydride from a diacid, but I think the position of the double bond in the starting material might influence the structure of the anhydride. Oh, but wait, the starting material is a diacid with a cis-alkene. So when it's dehydrated, it loses water and forms an anhydride. Now, the anhydride has a single peak in its 1H NMR at 7 ppm. 7 ppm is usually aromatic protons. But wait, if the anhydride is from a diacid, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. Alternatively, if it's a substituted anhydride, perhaps it's part of a ring. Hmm.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which suggests that all the protons in the aromatic region are equivalent. So maybe it's a cyclic anhydride with a benzene ring? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe the anhydride is part of a ring that causes the protons to be equivalent.

Looking at the 13C NMR: two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is probably a carbonyl (like an ester or an anhydride), but wait, no, 165 ppm is more likely a carbonyl. Wait, 137 ppm is probably a
