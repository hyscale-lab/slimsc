Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that expectation values involve the state vector and the operator in question. Let's break it down.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. So I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

First, expectation values are calculated using ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I should probably compute this for each part of the operator and then add them together.

Let me write down the state ψ. ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3)/2 |↓⟩. To make sure I have the right coefficients, wait, 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (√3/2)^2 is 3/4, which adds up to 1. So that's a valid state.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩. I can split this into two terms: 10⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ +5⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So I need to compute both expectation values for σz and σx.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. Because σz |↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩.

So ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + ( (√3/2) )^2 * (-1). Let's compute that. 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (√3/2)^2 is 3/4. So 0.25*(+1) = 0.25, 3/4*(-1) = -0.75. Adding those, 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, 10 times that is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Wait no, wait. Wait, wait, no. Because the operator is 10σz, so the expectation is 10 times ⟨σz⟩, which is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Wait, no, because the operator is 10σz, so its expectation is 10 times the expectation of σz. Oh, right, so 10 * (-0.5) is -5.

Now, the other term is 5⟨σx⟩. So I need to compute ⟨σx⟩ for the state ψ.

Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin states. So σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So how do I compute ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩?

Let me write the state as a vector. For a spin-1/2 particle, |↑⟩ is (1,0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So ψ is [0.5; (√3)/2].

So let me write ψ as a column vector: [0.5; (√3)/2 ].

Then σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ would be [0*0.5 + 1*(√3/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(√3/2) ] = [ √3/2, 0.5 ].

So ψ† σx ψ is the inner product of ψ with σx ψ. So ψ† is [0.5, √3/2 ].

So the inner product is (0.5)(√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = (0.5 * √3/2) + (√3/2 * 0.5) = same as 2*(0.5 * √3/2) )= 2*(√3/4) )= √3/2.

Wait, let me compute that again. First term: 0.5 * (√3/2) = √3/4.

Second term: (√3/2) * 0.5 = √3/4.

So total is √
