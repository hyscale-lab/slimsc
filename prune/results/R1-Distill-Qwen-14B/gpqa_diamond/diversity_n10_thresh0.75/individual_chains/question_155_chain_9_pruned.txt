Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨ψ|A²|ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ|A|ψ⟩², where A is the operator in question, and |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

Alright, so given that, the state of the system is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I also know that the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis here is |1⟩, |0⟩, |-1⟩, perhaps? Because P_z's matrix has eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So its diagonal matrix would have those on the diagonal.

The operator P_x is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down to visualize:

P_x matrix:
First row: 0, ℏ/√2, 0
Second row: ℏ/√2, 0, ℏ/√2
Third row: 0, ℏ/√2, 0

Similarly, P_y is given with some i terms. But since the state is an eigenvector of P_x, perhaps we don't need P_y for this problem.

Wait, the question is about the uncertainty in P_z. So I need to compute ΔP_z for the given state.

The state is given as |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. So in vector form, it's a 3-component vector. Let me note that.

First, I should check if this state is normalized. Let's compute its norm.

The norm squared is ( (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 ) = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find the uncertainty in P_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩, then apply the formula.

First, let's write down the matrix for P_z:

P_z matrix:
First row: ℏ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ℏ

So P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

So applying P_z to |ψ⟩:

P_z |ψ⟩ = [ ℏ*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (-ℏ)*(-1/2) ]^T = [ -ℏ/2, 0, ℏ/2 ]^T.

Wait, but I'm supposed to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z.

So ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me compute that. Let me denote the components of ψ as a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

So ψ† is [ a*, b*, c* ].

But since a and c are real, their conjugates are themselves. b is also real, I think. Wait, 1/√2 is a real number, so b* = b.

So,

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ = a*(P_z a) + b*(P_z b) + c*(P_z c)
But P_z has diagonal elements, so each term is the product of the component and the corresponding diagonal element.

Wait, wait, no. The correct way is ψ† multiplied by P_z multiplied by ψ.

But since P_z is diagonal, we can compute each term as the product of the component and the diagonal element, then sum.

Alternatively, more precisely:

⟨P_z⟩ = a * (P_z[1,1] * a) + b * (P_z[2,2] * b) + c * (P_z[3,3] * c)
Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, P_z is diagonal, so when you multiply P_z by |ψ⟩, each component of |ψ⟩ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So:

P_z |ψ⟩ is a vector where:

first component is ℏ * a = ℏ*(-1/2),
second component is 0 * b = 0,
third component is (-ℏ) * c = (-ℏ)(-1/2) = ℏ/2
