Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's see what the question is. It's about some reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... right, those are point groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, etc. 

The question gives a series of reactions. Let me break them down step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. Bright red product—could that be something like sulfur? Or maybe a transition metal compound? Wait, 8 equivalents is a big number, so maybe it's a reaction involving something like sulfur trioxide or another compound with high stoichiometry.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. So, 2C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Oh, hazardous products might include something like a highly toxic gas, maybe chlorine, phosgene, or something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids could be like H2SO4, HCl, HNO3. Weak ones might be acetic acid or something similar. So, if C reacts with water to give A and two acids, perhaps C is something like a sulfide or a nitride? Or maybe a metal oxide?

Wait, another point: when C is reacted with water, it produces two different acids. So maybe C is a salt that, when hydrolyzed, gives two different acid components. Alternatively, perhaps C is a compound that, upon hydrolysis, releases two different acid anions. Hmm...

Wait, if F is a strong acid and G is a weak one, maybe C is a nitride? Because nitrides can react with water to produce ammonia and other products. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another reaction given: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, D + B → H (solvent). Solvents are things like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Wait, D and B in 1:1 ratio make a solvent. So, what if B is a
