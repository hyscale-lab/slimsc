Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a weak acid-strong base titration. The pH changes depending on how much NaOH has been added.

First, I think I need to find out the initial concentrations after dilution and then determine the equivalence point.

Let me break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution.

Volume is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 L. Molarity is 0.05 M.

Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Step 2: Dilution. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L.

The new concentration after dilution is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O

Molar ratio is 1:1.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be equal to moles of CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH initially is 0.001, so the volume of NaOH needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, wait. But the question isn't about the equivalence point yet. It's asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

25% titration means 25% of the required NaOH volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

So, for 25% titration:

Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of CH3COOH will decrease by 0.00025, and moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) will increase by 0.00025.

But wait, the initial moles of acetic acid after dilution was 0.001 moles. So after adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, which is 25% of the equivalence point, we'll have:

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume at this point is initial volume (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution
