Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let's read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

We have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Got that.

Then, someone puts a small amount of positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P, which is outside the conductor. The distance from the center of the conductor to point P is L. Also, the distance from the center of the cavity to P is l, and both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. Alright, so I remember that when charges are inside a conductor's cavity, the conductor's induced charges can affect the electric field in certain regions. But since the conductor is uncharged, the total charge on it is zero. So probably, the inner surface will have an induced charge, and the outer surface will have another.

Wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. When a positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (which is the cavity's wall) must induce a charge of -q. Because like charges repel, the +q will attract electrons to the inner surface. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge +q. Because the inner was -q, so the outer must balance it to make the total zero.

But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when +q is placed inside, the conductor's inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so inner is -q, outer is +q to balance.

Now, what about the electric field outside the conductor? Remember, for a spherical conductor with charge Q, the electric field outside is as if the charge were concentrated at the center. So, for a point outside, the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q / r²), where r is the distance from the center.

In this case, the outer surface charge is +q, so the total charge outside is +q. So, the electric field outside the conductor (at point P) should just be due to this outer charge, as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is +q, and the conductor's inner surface is -q, outer is +q. So the net charge on the conductor is zero. Wait no, the conductor was uncharged, so the inner surface is -q, outer is +q. Hmm, but the conductor's total charge is zero, because it's uncharged. Oh wait, no, the conductor's net charge is zero, so that the outer surface must have +q because the inner is -q. Because conductor's total is inner + outer = (-q) + (something) = 0. So something must be +q.

So the outer surface has +q, so the field outside should be E = (1/(4πε₀))*(q)/(L²), since L is the distance from the center to point P.

Wait,
