Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I know regarding planet density.

Density is mass divided by volume, right? So each option gives different masses and sometimes the radius or composition. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a says it's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, so this planet would have the same density as Earth. That's a starting point.

Option b is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but wait—no, option b actually states that the planet has a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Oh, so regardless of mass, the density is given here. So its density is same as Earth or option a. Hmm, but wait, if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is 5.5, then the radius must be larger than Earth's. Because density is mass/volume, and if density is same, mass is proportional to volume, which is radius cubed.

Wait, but the question is about which has the highest density. So option b's density is 5.5, same as Earth, so same as a. So that's not higher.

Option c is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density as Earth. Because density is based on composition. So if it's the same composition, the density would be the same as Earth. So the density here would be 5.5 g/cm³, same as a and b. But wait, that's not possible—wait, the question is about the highest density, so all three a, b, c have same density? Or did I miss something.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Earth's density is about 5.5. If another planet has the same composition, its density should be the same regardless of mass or radius. So options a, b (if it's Earth's composition?), wait, wait, no. Wait, option b says a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5. So that's same as Earth's density. Option c's planet has same composition as Earth, so same density, 5.5. So if all options a, b, c have 5.
