Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I remember that when objects are moving, their speed relative to another frame can get a bit tricky, especially if we're dealing with light. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem states: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are A to D, with B being 1, which is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, the light is in glass, so that's confusing. Oh right, the speed of light in glass is typically c/n, where c is vacuum speed, but that's in the rest frame of the glass.

So the glass itself is moving. How does that affect the observed speed of the light? I think I need to use some sort of velocity addition formula here, probably from special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add linearly.

Wait, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the observer is in the lab, which is stationary, and the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, actually, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. No, wait, the beam is going through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the light is going in the
