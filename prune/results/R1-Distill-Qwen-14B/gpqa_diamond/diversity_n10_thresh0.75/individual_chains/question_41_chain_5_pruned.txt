Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm. Let's see. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Alright, let's break this down. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Oh wait, the index of refraction n is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum (which is c=1 here) to the speed in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the glass is 1/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass. But here, the glass is moving. So I guess we need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the observed speed.

Wait, but wait, according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light in a vacuum is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. But this is inside a medium, not a vacuum. So maybe the situation is different. Because when the medium is moving, it's not the same as a vacuum. So the speed of light in the medium would depend on the medium's motion relative to the observer.

Hmm, maybe I should think about it using the concept of relative velocity. Suppose the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light's speed in the glass, when
