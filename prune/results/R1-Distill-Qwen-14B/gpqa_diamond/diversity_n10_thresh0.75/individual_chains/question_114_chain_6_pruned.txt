Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different reagents A and B.

Hmm. Let's tackle each reaction step by step.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is another name for methyl acetone, which is (CH3)2C=O. When you have a ketone reacting with NaCN, I think this is a nucleophilic addition. In such reactions, usually, the ketone's carbonyl group reacts with a cyanide ion.

Wait, but in the product, we have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacting with NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The butanenitrile part is four carbons with the nitrile on the end. But wait, the formula would be something like CH2CH2CN with some substituents. Maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CH(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe (CH2CN) attached to the same carbon as OH and methyl.

Wait, but I
