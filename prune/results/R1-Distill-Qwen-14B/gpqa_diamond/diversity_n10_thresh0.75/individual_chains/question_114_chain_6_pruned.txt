Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give different possibilities for A and B.

Hmm, I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's usually through some kind of substitution or addition. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh right! The reaction where a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN-) is a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile and adds to the carbonyl carbon, which gets protonated during the reaction.

So the first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN. I think the product is a cyanohydrin, which is a compound that has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) would add CN- to the carbonyl, making (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about the structure. The starting ketone is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. The formula for that would be C5H9NO, but wait, let me check the structure.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when we add CN, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. The formula for this product would be C4H7NO. Let me count: butan
