Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given as c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So putting that together, S would look like:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Got it. So Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), that's a constant factor. So the first thing I might want to do is write out what Ay looks like.

Wait, what's the operator Ay? Oh right, it's the Y-component of the angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators are related to Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, S in this case seems similar to the Pauli Y matrix, but let me check. The Pauli Y matrix is usually written as:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Which matches exactly with S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is σy. So Ay is c times σy. But wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so that makes sense.

But wait, the intrinsic angular momentum for a muon (which is a lepton, like an electron but heavier) would have spin-1/2. So the angular momentum components are given by ħ times the Pauli matrices. Oh, because for spin-1/2 particles, S = ħ σ / 2, but wait, sometimes the notation varies. Let me think.

Wait, the total angular momentum J is given by ħ times the Pauli matrices divided by 2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So J_y would be (ħ/2) σy. But in this problem, Ay is given as c * S, where c = h/(4π). Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So substituting h = 2π ħ, c becomes (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So c is ħ/2. Oh wait, that's correct because the spin matrices have S = ħ/2 σ. So Ay is (ħ/2) σy, which makes sense for the Y-component.

So the operator Ay is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix. Now, the problem says to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh, right, eigenvalues of σy are ±i, because σy squared is identity, so eigenvalues are i and -i. Let me confirm that. Because σy is a Hermitian matrix? Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, σ matrices are Hermitian, so their eigenvalues should be real. Wait a minute, σy is Hermitian because its complex conjugate transpose is itself. Yes, because [0, i; -i, 0], which is the same as the original matrix. So σy is Hermitian, so its eigenvalues must be real. Oh wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. Wait, maybe I'm confusing with another matrix.

Wait, let me compute the eigenvalues of σy. The Pauli Y matrix. The trace is 0, determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = - (i*(-i))= - ( ( -i^2 )) = - ( - (-1) )= wait, i squared is -1. So (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = +1. So determinant is 0*0 - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = - (i^2*(-1))? Wait, maybe I should compute it straight. Let me compute the determinant of S, which is [0 -i; i 0]. So determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - (-i^2) = 0 - ( (-i^2) ) → i squared is -1, so (-i)(i) = -i² = 1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1. Wait, that can't be right because the determinant of σy is -1. Hmm.

But for eigenvalues, trace is 0, so the sum is zero, product is -1. So the eigenvalues λ would satisfy λ² = -1, so λ = ±i. Wait, but that's impossible because σy is Hermitian, which should have real eigenvalues. Wait, wait, this is a contradiction. Did I make a mistake here?

Oh wait, I must have made a mistake in the matrix. Let me double-check. The standard Pauli Y matrix is defined as:

σy = [ 0  -i ]
        [ i   0 ]

Which is what the problem states for matrix S. Now, the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - ( -i * i )= 0 - ( -i² )= - ( - (-1) )= ??? Wait, no. Let me compute (-i)(i) as follows. (-i) * i = - (i^2) = - (-1) = +1. So determinant is 0 - (1) = -1. Hmm, but for Hermitian matrices, the determinant can be negative, but the eigenvalues are still real. Wait, but if the eigenvalues are λ, then λ^2 = determinant. So λ^2 = -1, which would imply λ is imaginary, which contradicts that σy is Hermitian. So that's a problem. Wait, I must have messed up something here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the definition of the Pauli matrices. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, which means their eigenvalues are real. So the eigenvalues of σy must be real, so the determinant must be positive. But according to my calculation, determinant is -1, which would imply eigenvalues i and -i. But that can't be right because σy is Hermitian. So where is the mistake?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the determinant calculation. Let me try again. The matrix S is:

Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

So the determinant is (0)(0) - (-i)(i) = 0 - [ (-i)(i) ].

Calculating (-i)(i) = (-1)(i^2) = (-1)(-1) = +1.

So determinant is 0 - (+1) = -1. So determinant is -1, which suggests that the product of the eigenvalues is -1. But for a Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues must be real. So if their product is -1, their sum is 0, and their product is -1, then the eigenvalues are λ = [0 ± sqrt(0 +4)] /2. Wait, no, for a 2x2 matrix with trace T and determinant D, the eigenvalues are [T ± sqrt(T² -4D)] / 2. Here, T=0, D=-1.

So eigenvalues are [0 ± sqrt(0 +4) ] / 2? Because T² is 0, so sqrt(0 -4*(-1)) = sqrt(4) = 2. So eigenvalues are (0 + 2)/2 = 1 and (0-2)/2 = -1. Oh wait, that's different. So I must have made a mistake in the earlier calculation of eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of S (σy) are +1 and -1. Because the trace is zero, their sum is zero, and product is -1, so the eigenvalues are 1 and -1? Wait, wait. Wait, let me compute the eigenvalues properly.

The characteristic equation is det(S - λ I )=0.

So S - λ I is:

[ -λ    -i ]
[ i     -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - ( (-i)(i) )

As before, (-i)(i) = 1. So determinant is λ² - 1 = 0 → λ² =1 → λ= ±1.

Oh! So the eigenvalues are +1 and -1. But wait, that makes sense because σy is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real, as expected. So σy has eigenvalues ±1.

So Ay is c * S, where c = h/(4π) = ħ/2, as I thought earlier. So the eigenvalues of Ay would be c times the eigenvalues of S. So Ay's eigenvalues are c*(+1) and c*(-1).

So λ = c * ±1. Since c = ħ/2, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2. Wait, but wait. Wait, the problem says that the eigenvalue is a, so Ay φ = a φ. So a can be ± c *1, which is ±c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π) * 1 = ± h/(4π). Wait, but h is 2π ħ, so h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check what they say.

Option A: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh or ±..., but wait, that can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. Because the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real. So if the operator is Hermitian, the eigenvalues are real. So any option that suggests the eigenvalues have imaginary parts must be wrong.

Wait, but let's think: is Ay Hermitian? Because S is Hermitian (as per earlier, since S is σy, which is Hermitian), and c is a real constant. So Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, so Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues must be real. So any option suggesting eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Im(eigenvalue) = ±2πh or ±... but since eigenvalues are real, this can't be right. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Im part is ±1/2, real ±1. Again, the eigenvalues are real, so this is wrong. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. So A² is the square of the Y-component angular momentum. Because angular momentum components don't commute, in general, an eigenstate of Ay won't be an eigenstate of Az. But what about A²? Well, A² is part of the total angular momentum squared. So, in quantum mechanics, for spin-1/2 particles, the square of the total angular momentum is (ħ²)(s(s+1)), where s=1/2. So A² is part of that, but since Ay is only the Y-component, A² would be (Ay)^2. Wait, but in this case, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so it's spin. So A² is (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2). But if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then (Ay)^2 acting on φ gives a^2 φ, so that's an eigenvalue. But what about A², which includes Ax and Az as well? Well, if φ is an eigenstate of Ay, then it's not an eigenstate of Ax or Az unless they commute. But in general, they don't. So would the eigenfunctions of Ay also be eigenfunctions of A²?

Wait, A² is the square of the vector operator A, which in quantum mechanics is equal to (ħ²) s(s+1) times the identity matrix for spin-1/2, where s=1/2. So A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix. Therefore, any function is an eigenfunction of A², because A² is a multiple of the identity. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, then A² φ = (ħ² (1/2)(1/2+1)) φ. So yes, φ is also an eigenfunction of A². But what about Az? Az is another component, and since [Ay, Az] = iħ Ax (from angular momentum commutation relations), they don't commute, so φ cannot be an eigenfunction of both Ay and Az. Therefore, option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. So that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. Hmm. The basis functions would form a basis for the vector space that the matrix acts on. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors (eigenfunctions) form a basis for C². So yes, the eigenfunctions are the basis. But wait, the statement in D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. I'm not sure if that's the correct way to phrase it. The eigenfunctions make up a basis for the space, so perhaps D is correct. But let me think again.

Wait, the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the space the operator acts on. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors (if distinct) will form a basis. But if the operator has a single eigenvalue, then it might not be diagonalizable. But for Ay, which is cσy, which has two distinct eigenvalues, it is diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors form a basis. So D's statement is correct. So which options are correct?

Wait, but let's think about the options again. The question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Which is correct because A² is a multiple of identity, so any state is its eigenstate. So eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². But not necessarily of Az because they don't commute.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the question, the operator is Ay, a 2x2 matrix. Its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

So now, looking back at the options, the correct statements are C and D? Or wait, what's the exact wording.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both C and D would be correct? But wait, the question says which statement is correct. So perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with four options, and only one is correct. So let's reevaluate.

Wait, let me think about each option.

Option A: Imaginary part of eigenvalue is ±2πh or ... but eigenvalues are real, so A is wrong.

Option B: Again, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Option C: Correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not Az.

Option D: Correct because eigenfunctions form a basis.

But the question is, which statement is correct during the calculation. So the possible correct options are C and D.

Wait, looking again at the options, the question is which is correct. So the possible correct answers are C and D.

But looking back, the problem is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So for option C, whether the eigenfunctions can also be eigenfunctions of A^2. As I thought earlier, since A^2 is a multiple of the identity matrix, any vector is an eigenstate. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions form a basis. Which is correct because the operator is 2x2, and with two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors are linearly independent and form a basis.

Wait, but the way option D is phrased: "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." Hmm, perhaps the wording is a bit off. The eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, which is the domain of the operator. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements. But looking at the options, I must have made a mistake because only one option is correct.

Wait, but let me reevaluate.

Let me think again about option D. The operator Ay is 2x2. Its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) would form a basis for the space, which is two-dimensional. So yes, the eigenfunctions are a basis. So D's statement is correct.

So which options are correct? The question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

So both C and D could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct and D is incorrect. Wait, but the question is about the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, so perhaps D is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct when calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So when you calculate the eigenvectors, they form a basis. So D is correct.

But let me look at each option again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of the Z-component Az. As we discussed, that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Which is correct.

So both C and D are correct? But the options are multiple-choice and only one can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the operator A².

Wait, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so A² = Ax² + Ay² + Az². Since for a spin-1/2 particle, A² is (ħ²)(3/4) I, where I is the identity matrix. So any state is an eigenstate of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

But what about option D? The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That phrasing is a bit unclear. The matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the vector space it operates on. So D is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is making a point about the matrix representation. The matrix AY is 2x2, and its eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

So the problem is that both C and D are correct? But the options have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing some point. Let me think again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Which is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct.

But wait, perhaps the wording of D is incorrect. The matrix operator's basis is the computational basis, perhaps. Or the eigenfunctions are not necessarily a basis if there are repeated eigenvalues. But in this case, Ay has two distinct eigenvalues, so the eigenvectors are two in number and are a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the problem is that both options C and D can be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing them. Let me look again.

Wait, the question is: which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors.

Looking back, the question says that which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, perhaps in the calculation, we can find that the eigenfunctions form a basis (D is correct), and that they also are eigenfunctions of A² (C is correct). But perhaps the options don't have both C and D correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. Let me think about the statements:

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. So correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above. So correct.

But the options list only one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that D is correct.

Wait, another approach: when I diagonalize a matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space. So for a 2x2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, the eigenvectors are linearly independent, so they form a basis. So D is correct.

So both C and D are correct, but perhaps in the options, only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is designed so that only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other clues. Let me think about the eigenvalues again.

Earlier, I thought the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2. But let's compute them accurately.

Ay = c * S, where c = h/(4π) = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) S, and S has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay's eigenvalues are (ħ/2)(±1) )= ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2. Now, looking at the options, which one matches this.

Looking at option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. That can't be right because our eigenvalues are real.

Option A: imaginary parts are ±2πh, which is wrong.

Hmm, so perhaps the eigenvalues have real parts, but looking at the options, none mention real parts. So perhaps the eigenvalues are purely real, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the eigenvalues of Ay.

Ay = (ħ/2) S, and S has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2).

Now, ħ is h/(2π). So ħ/2 is (h/(2π)) )/ 2 = h/(4π), which is equal to c. So the eigenvalues are ± c.

Wait, because c is h/(4π), which is ħ/2. So yes, the eigenvalues are ± c, which is ± h/(4π).

Looking at option A: Im part is ±2πh, which is wrong. So no.

Option B: Im part is ±1/2. No way.

So the correct eigenvalues are real, ± h/(4π). But none of the options (A and B) mention real parts. So perhaps the correct options are C and D.

But the problem is, the options don't have any mentioning of the real eigenvalues. So perhaps the correct answer is option C and D.

Wait, but the question is a multiple-choice with four options, and only one is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenfunctions of Ay are not the same as those of A².

Wait, no, because A² is a multiple of identity, so every vector is an eigenfunction. So option C is correct.

Hmm, perhaps only option C is correct, and D is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement in D is incorrect because the matrix operator's basis refers to the standard basis, not the eigenbasis.

Wait, the eigenfunctions φ form a basis, but the matrix operator is given in the standard basis, perhaps. So the statement in D might be incorrect.

Wait, the question says the matrix operator has a certain form. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the correct way is that the eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space, which is the same as the space the operator acts on. So D's statement is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix is given in a particular basis, and the eigenfunctions are a different basis. But regardless, the eigenfunctions form a basis for the same space, so D is correct.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach from another angle.

The problem is to find which statement is correct when calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Since A² is a multiple of the identity matrix, any φ is an eigenfunction of A². So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Since operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors are two in number and linearly independent, they form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the problem states that the operator is 2x2, so the eigenvectors would form a basis. So both C and D are correct. But in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the question is about the calculation during which which statement is correct.

Hmm. Another approach: which of the statements is necessarily correct.

Since the eigenfunctions form a basis, D is correct. So perhaps D is correct.

But I'm a bit confused because both C and D make sense.

Wait, perhaps the operator Ay has the same eigenvectors as A², but in any case, C is correct.

Wait, given that the question is multiple-choice, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Because the eigenfunctions of Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, after all this, I think the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix with the form:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix, which is Hermitian. Its eigenvalues are \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \). Substituting \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which simplifies to \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) (since \( h = 2\pi\hbar \)).
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are real, as \( A_y \) is Hermitian.

2. **Option A:**  
   This option states that the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) or \( \pm h/4\pi \), and the real part are \( \pm h/4\pi \) or \( \pm 1/2 \).  
   - This is incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are purely real, not complex.

3. **Option B:**  
   This option states that the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 1/2 \), and the real part are \( \pm 1 \).  
   - This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real and do not match the values given in this option.

4. **Option C:**  
   This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the Z-component \( A_z \).  
   - \( A^2 \) is the square of the total angular momentum operator, which for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle is a multiple of the identity matrix (\( A^2 = \frac{3\hbar^2}{4} I \)). Therefore, any eigenfunction of \( A_y \) is also an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \).  
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).  
   - This statement is correct.

5. **Option D:**  
   This option states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \).  
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) form a basis for the 2-dimensional vector space on which \( A_y \) acts. Since \( A_y \) is a 2×2 matrix with two distinct eigenvalues, its eigenvectors are linearly independent and span the space.  
   - This statement is also correct.

### Conclusion:
Both options C and D are correct. However, the question asks for a single correct statement. Since option C directly addresses the relationship between the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) and \( A^2 \), as well as their lack of commutation with \( A_z \), it is the most relevant and complete answer.

**Answer: C**
