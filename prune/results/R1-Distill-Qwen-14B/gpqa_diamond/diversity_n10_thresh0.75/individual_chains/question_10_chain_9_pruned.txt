Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density among the options given. Hmm, let's see. The question lists four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, so I need to figure out the density of each.

Starting with option a: It's an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³ because it's similar to Earth, right? So if it's same mass and radius, same density. So a's density is 5.5.

Moving to option b: The planet has twice Earth's mass and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait. Wait, the question says it's a density of approximately 5.5. Oh, so regardless of mass, the density is given directly. So b's density is 5.5.

Option c: Same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Wait, same composition would mean similar density, right? Because composition affects density. So Earth's density is 5.5, so if this planet is made of the same stuff, its density should be the same. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. Again, same composition implies same density. So d's density is also 5.5.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The question asks which has the HIGHEST density. If all options have same density, that's surprising. But maybe I'm
