Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem states that the operator P is a vector operator, with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these components is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Wait, so n is in the x-z plane, which means its direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Oh wait, no, wait. The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so the angle φ would be zero. So the direction is along θ in the x-z plane, meaning the spherical coordinates have φ=0. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? But wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so maybe the operator we need is P · n, which is the component of P in the direction of n.

So the operator in question is P_n = P · n = Px * nx + Py * ny + Pz * nz. Since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P_n = Px * sinθ + Pz * cosθ.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of P_n with
