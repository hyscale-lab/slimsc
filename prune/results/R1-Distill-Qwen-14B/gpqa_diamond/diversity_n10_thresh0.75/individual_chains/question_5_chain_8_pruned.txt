Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. But let's take it step by step.

Okay, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But since the direction is along an arbitrary n in the x-z plane, which means n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component of n is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) maybe? Wait, or is it (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Hmm, I think for angles in the x-z plane, θ is measured from the x-axis towards the z-axis. So the direction vector n would be (cosθ, 0, sinθ), right?

But wait, the operator P is along direction n. So the operator we're interested in is P · n? Or is it the component P_n = (P · n) in the direction n. Because when you have an operator along an arbitrary direction, you can express it as a combination of the components. So the operator we're looking at is (P · n), which would be P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z.

But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P · n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n_y is zero, Py doesn't contribute. So the operator we're considering is n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the problem says the operator is P along direction n. So that's correct. So the operator is P · n, and that's the one we need to find the eigenvector for, with eigenvalue ħ/2.

So our goal is to find the eigenvector of the operator (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But first, let's write down each component of P.

Px is given as (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2.

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]].

Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, let me write each of them:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1
