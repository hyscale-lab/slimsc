Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. It's mounted on the VLT, which are big telescopes—8 meters each. So, the key here is figuring out which stars have a high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel in one hour.

The question lists six stars (a to f). Let's go through each one.

I think the absolute V magnitude and distance are crucial because that determines the apparent brightness, which affects the S/N. Oh right, the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log d, where M is absolute magnitude and d is distance in parsecs. Wait, no, it's m = M + 5 log (d) - 5. Because the formula is m = M + 5 log (d/10). Oh right, so m = M + 5 * (log d) -5.

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude (m), which tells me how bright they appear from Earth. Brighter stars (lower m) will be easier to detect since more photons mean higher S/N.

The ESPRESSO's sensitivity—I should check what its S/N capability is. From what I recall, ESPRESSO can reach about S/N 100 per pixel for bright stars in one hour. But wait, the question specifies a minimum S/N of 10 per binned pixel. So even if a star is very bright, it should be detectable.

Wait, but the problem is about the ability to achieve S/N of 10. So which stars are bright enough for that?

Let me think about the V magnitude. The lower the m, the brighter the star. The formula again: m = M +5 log d -5.

Let's compute m for each star:

a) Canopus. I think Canopus is a bright star. From memory, its apparent magnitude is around -0.7. So m is about -0.7. Wait, but the question says it's Canopus, so maybe I don't need to compute, just know it's very bright.

b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is about 2, maybe a bit more. So m is around 2.

c) Star with M=15 mag at 10 pc. So m = 15 +5*(log 10) -5. Log10 is 1, so 5*1=5. 15+5-5=15. So m=15.

d) Same M=15, but 200 pc. Log(200) is about 2.301. So 5*2.301=11.505. m=15+11.505-5=21.505. So m≈21.5.

e) M=15, 5 pc. Log(5)=0.69897. 5 * 0.69897 ≈3.495. m=15 +3.495 -5 =13.495. So m≈13.5.

f) M=15, 50 pc. Log(50)=1.69897. 5 *1.69897≈8.494. m=15+8.494-5=18.494. So m≈18.5.

So now, the stars' apparent magnitudes:

a) m≈-0.7 (very bright)
b) m≈2 (moderately bright)
c) m=15 (faint)
d) m≈21.5 (very faint)
e) m≈13.5 (fairly faint)
f) m≈18.5 (very faint)

Wait, but how does the apparent magnitude relate to the signal-to-noise ratio? I need to figure out for each star whether ESPRESSO can reach S/N 10 per bin in an hour.

I remember that the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time. But here, the exposure is 1 hour, so that's fixed. So we need to find which stars are bright enough for ESPRESSO to reach S/N ≥10.

ESPRESSO's performance is such that it can reach S/N per pixel of about 10 for stars around certain magnitudes. I think the limit is something like V ~ 20 or so. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers.

Alternatively, I might need to think about the relationship between apparent magnitude and the number of photons detected, which affects S/N. The formula for S/N is roughly proportional to 10^(-0.4 m) times sqrt(t), where t is exposure time. But I'm not exactly certain about the precise formula.

Wait, the formula for photon flux is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is the flux from a zero-magnitude star. The S/N is proportional to F * sqrt(t) / noise per
