Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They've given the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about other factors affecting the EDTA's protonation or anything like that.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, like calcium. The formation constant, Kf, tells us how strong the complex is. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable. So in this case, the K is 5e10, which is quite large, indicating a very stable complex.

The solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's the stoichiometry here? Oh right, the formula is usually something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA. So the complex is CaY^2-.

Now, the question is asking about the concentration of free calcium ions [Ca²+] in the solution. So, we're looking for [Ca²+] when the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

I think I should use the formation constant expression here. The formation constant (Kf) is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-
So the expression for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So, assuming that all the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex, except a tiny amount that dissociates, I can model this.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and the complex is 1:1 with Ca²+. So the concentration of the complex, [CaEDTA^2-], is 0.02 M.

But I also remember that EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. However, the problem says the pH is ideal, so perhaps it's already in the form that
