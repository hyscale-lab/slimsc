Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex is formed, and the formation constant (Kf) is given.

Wait, what's the formation constant? Oh right, the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (or whatever the charge is, but the exact charge might not matter here).

The key equation for the formation constant is Kf = [CaEDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). Since the problem says the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, that means the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote [CaEDTA] as 0.02 M.

But wait, what about the initial concentrations of Ca^2+ and EDTA? Well, in the solution, the Ca is all tied up in the complex, right? Well, not exactly. Because some of it might dissociate, but given that
