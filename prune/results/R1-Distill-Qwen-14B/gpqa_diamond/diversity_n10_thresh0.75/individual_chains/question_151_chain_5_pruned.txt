Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see. The question is about finding the probability that a measurement of an observable P yields 0 at a certain time t. 

Hmm, I remember from my studies that observables are represented by matrices, and the state of the system is a vector. To find the probability, I think I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator P because the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are related to the eigenvectors.

Wait, but wait. The state vector is given, and the operator is given. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the expectation value or something else. No, wait. For the probability, I think the approach is to express the state vector in terms of the eigenstates of the observable P. Then, the square of the amplitude (the coefficient) for the eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 would be the probability.

Wait, but first, I need to see what the matrix P looks like. The matrix P is given with three rows. Let me write it out:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, that's a 3x3 matrix. So P is a 3x3 matrix, and the state vector is a 3-element column vector: [-1, 2, 1]^T.

Wait, but the state vector is the system's state at time t. So, to find the probability, I need to calculate the expectation value? Or perhaps find the eigenvalues of P and see if 0 is one of them, and then find the eigenvectors.

Wait, no. The general approach for finding the probability that a measurement of an observable P yields a value λ is to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ, project the state onto that eigenvector, and the square of the norm of that projection is the probability.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and 0 is one of them, I assume.

Wait, but let me compute the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

Hmm. Let me try to find its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant of:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]
[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]
[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

I remember that for a 3x3 matrix, calculating the determinant can be a bit involved. Let me try to compute it.

The determinant is: 

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- 1/sqrt(2) * [
