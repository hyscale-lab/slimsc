Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let me think through all the information given.

So, both planets are Earth-like and have the same mass. They were detected with the radial velocity method, meaning we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1's period is P1 and Planet_2 is P2, where P2 = 3 * P1.

Wait, wait, actually the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter. Oh right, so if Planet_2's period is longer, like P2 = 3 * P1. For example, if Planet_1 is 10 days, Planet_2 is 30 days.

Both have circular orbits. The host stars are different. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host, but both stars have the same radius. Hmm, that's interesting because usually more massive stars are larger, but here they must be at different evolutionary stages. But their radii are the same, so R1 = R2.

We need to find which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of transit depends on the size of the planet and the size of the star, but wait, no, actually the probability is more about the orbital geometry. Let me recall the formula.

The transit probability (P) is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / (sqrt(a² + d²))) )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Another approach: The transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for the transit to occur. But wait, the main factor for the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a)), or maybe (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a) or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for the transit probability. I remember that the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the size of the star and the planet's size. Let me think again.

The probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a), but wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a /
