Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to think it through. The question is about electric fields around a charged conductor with a cavity. Hmm, I remember something about conductors and charge distribution. Let me try to visualize the setup.

So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is separated by a distance s from the conductor's center. The radius of the cavity is r, and since r < R, the cavity is entirely within the conductor. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. 

The question is asking about the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. 

I think I should recall how charges inside a conductor's cavity affect the electric field outside. Oh right! In electrostatics, when a conductor is neutral, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface will induce an opposite charge, and the outer surface will have the same charge as the placed charge. Or wait, no, wait. No, wait. Let me get this straight. If the conductor is uncharged, when you put a charge +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the one facing the cavity) will have an induced charge of -q. Because the charge +q in the cavity would attract the opposite charge on the inner surface. 

But then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q, which adds up to +q. Wait, no, wait, no. Oh wait, the conductor was initially uncharged, so when you add +q inside, the inner surface must have -q. Then, the total charge on the conductor would be the sum of the inner and outer charges. But if the conductor was initially neutral, the total charge must still be zero. So the outer surface must have +q, right? Because inner is -q, outer is +q, so net conductor charge is zero. 

So, the outer surface ends up having a charge of +q. Now, the point P is outside the conductor, so when we're calculating the electric field there, only the charge on the outer surface matters. Because the electric field outside a conductor depends only on the total enclosed charge. Oh wait, that's Gauss's law. 

Wait, Gauss's law says that the electric flux through a Gaussian surface is Q_enclosed/(epsilon_0). So for a point outside the conductor, the Gaussian surface encloses the entire conductor. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface -q. So the total enclosed charge would be +q. So the electric field outside should be the same as if all the charge +q were concentrated at the center, right? Because the outer shell's charge distributes spherically symmetrically.

But wait, the setup here is a bit more complicated. Because the cavity isn't centered at the conductor's center. The center of the cavity is offset by a distance s from the conductor's center. So the charge inside the cavity is at a point that's not the center of the conductor. Hmm, does that affect the external field?

I remember something about displacement of charges. When the cavity is not at the center, the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces might not be symmetric. Wait, but wait, the conductor is a sphere. No, no, the conductor is spherical, so even if the cavity is off-center, the external field should still be as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. Because the conductor's shape is symmetric. Or is it?

Wait, no. Wait, the conductor is a sphere, so it has spherical symmetry. So any charges induced on its surfaces would arrange themselves symmetrically. Wait, but the cavity isn't at the center. Hmm. Let me think. Suppose the
