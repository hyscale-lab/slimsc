Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. I remember that in quantum mechanics, probabilities of measuring a state in a particular eigenstate are given by the squared magnitude of the amplitude for that eigenstate.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's equal to a constant times that sum. Oh right, because when you have a state expressed in terms of basis states, it should be normalized. So I think I need to normalize |alpha> first.

Let me write down the state. So |alpha> = c * [(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>], where c is the normalization constant. To find c, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and set it equal to 1.

The inner product would be |c|^2 times [ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ] because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Wait, each term comes from the product of the coefficients. So let's compute each part.

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². Oh, wait, i² is -1, so that becomes 1 -i +i +1 = 2.

Second term: (2 -i)(2 +i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the inner product is |c|^2 (2 +5) = 7 |c|^2. Since the state is normalized, 7|c|^2 =1 → |c|=1/sqrt(7). So c = 1/sqrt(7), assuming it's real and positive.

So the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)|up> /sqrt(7) + (2 -i)|down>/sqrt(7).

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2, because it's spin-1/2 system (up and down are the two states). So the matrix would be:
A = [[0, hbar/2],
     [hbar/2, 0]]

Because for i≠j (the off-diagonal elements) it's hbar/2, and diagonal elements (i=j) are zero.

Wait, but wait, in matrix terms, A has elements A12 = A21 = hbar/2, and A11 = A22 = 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix that looks like this:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Hmm, I remember that this kind of matrix represents an operator proportional to the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A would be (hbar/2) times sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of A should be (hbar/2)(+1) = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)(-1) = -hbar/2.

Wait, but in the problem, we're supposed to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A. So we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the square of the coefficients will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is a 2x2 matrix, perhaps we can find its eigenstates and express |alpha> in terms of them.

Let me think about the eigenstates of A. Since A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, the spin-up and spin-down along the x-axis.

The eigenstate |+x> of sigma_x is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The eigenstates of sigma_x are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations. Sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, right?

Wait, the standard eigenstates are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>, I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of these.

So |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>

I need to find a and b. Since |+x> and |−x> are orthonormal, a is the inner product of |alpha> with |+x>, and similarly for b.

So let's compute a:

a = < +x | alpha >

Which is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) multiplied by ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) )

Wait, so I can write this as:

a = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Compute the numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i. So 3.

So a = 3/(sqrt(14)).

Wait, but wait, no. Because the inner product is the sum of products. Let me think again.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)

So < +x | alpha > = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

The inner product (bra-ket) becomes:

(1+i) * <up|up> + (2 -i) * <down|up> + (1+i) * <up|down> + (2 -i) * <down|down> ) all multiplied by 1/(sqrt(2)sqrt(7)) )

But <up|up> is 1, <down|down> is 1, and the cross terms are zero because |up> and |down> are orthogonal.

So that simplifies to:

[ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Which is (3) / (sqrt(14)).

Similarly, b = < -x | alpha >.

The state |−x> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So < -x | alpha > = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) / sqrt(7) ]

Again, inner product:

(1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <down|up>

plus (1+i) <up|down> (which is zero) and -(2 -i) <down|down> (since it's multiplied by -1)

So that becomes:

(1+i) *1 + (2 -i)*0
