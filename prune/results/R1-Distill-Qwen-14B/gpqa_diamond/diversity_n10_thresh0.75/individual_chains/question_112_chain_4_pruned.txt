Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again carefully.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which describes an electron. It's proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's "proportional," meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, right. The state is given as proportional, so I should find the normalization constant. The normalization condition is that the sum of the absolute squares of the coefficients should be 1. So for the given state, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). Let me compute the squared magnitudes.

The first coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2. The second coefficient is (2 - i). Its magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So adding those, 2 +5 =7. So the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7), right? So the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Now, the next part of the question is about calculating the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The operator has a matrix representation A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, what does that matrix look like?

Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles), the operator A would have zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, wait. Because if i != j, A_ij is hbar/2, else zero. So that's correct.

But wait, what's the significance of this operator? Oh, right! The eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[
