Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about neutrinos and the Sun's reactions. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. But all other reactions are the same. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands: band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium, and then in pp-II, it fuses into helium-4. The pp-III branch, I think, involves reactions that produce boron-8, which then decays into beryllium and emits neutrinos. Oh right, those are the Beryllium neutrinos, which are high-energy.

So if the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those high-energy neutrinos would stop. But what about the other branches? Since the question says all other reactions remained, the pp-I and pp-II probably continue normally.

The pp-III branch is a major source of high-energy neutrinos. So if it stops, the flux (number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second) in higher energy bands would drop. But how does this affect the specific energy bands in question?

I remember that the Sun emits neutrinos mainly from two processes: the dominant one is the pp-III branch, producing Beryllium-7, which decays into Boron-8 and emits neutrinos. These neutrinos have higher energies, around 800 keV and above, I think.

So, in the Sun, the main neutrino flux in the 800-900 keV range is from pp-III. If that branch stops, that flux would drop a lot. Meanwhile, the other reactions, like pp-I and pp-II, continue. Those produce lower-energy neutrinos, maybe in the 200-800 keV range? Or perhaps the same?

Wait, the pp-I and pp-II reactions produce lower-energy neutrinos. For example, the pp-I reaction creates deuterium, and there's a neutrino involved in that, but I'm not sure about the exact energy. Similarly, the pp-II step (the triple-alpha process?) produces more helium, but I think the neutrinos from the other branches are in lower energy.

But wait, in the Sun, the majority of the neutrinos come from the pp-III branch, which produces high-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy flux goes down.

So the question is about the ratio of flux in 700-800 (band 1) and 800-900 (band 2) keV. Without the pp-III branch, what happens to each band?

If pp-III is the main source of neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, then when it stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900) would drop significantly. What about band 1 (700-800)? I thought that the pp-I and pp-II reactions contribute to lower-energy neutrinos, but maybe some of their products also contribute
