Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each represented by 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

Wait, I need to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n. Since n is in the x-z plane, that means the direction vector has components (nx, 0, nz), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n can be expressed as (nx, 0, nz), and it's a unit vector, so nx² + nz² = 1.

The operator P is given in terms of its components. So the total operator P would be the sum of each component multiplied by the respective direction component. So P = nx * Px + nz * Pz. Oh wait, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the sum of its components multiplied by the direction's components.

Right, so let me write that out. Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]], Py is (ħ/2)*[[0, -i],[i, 0]], and Pz is (ħ/2)*[[1, 0], [0, -1]]. So the operator P along n is:

P = nx * Px + nz * Pz + 0 * Py (since the direction is in x-z plane, no y-component). So Py's term is zero. So P is:

nx*(ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + nz*(ħ/2)*[[1, 0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. The matrices are:

First term (nx term): [[0, nx*(ħ/2)], [nx*(ħ/2), 0]]
Second term (nz term): [[nz*(ħ/2), 0], [0, -nz*(ħ/2)]]

Adding them together, the matrix P is:

[ [nz*(ħ/2), nx*(ħ/2) ],
  [nx*(ħ/2), -nz*(ħ/2) ] ]

So the matrix form is [[a, b], [b*, c]], but wait, in this case, both a and c are real, right? Because nx and nz are real.

We're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (P - λ I) |v> = 0, where λ is +ħ/2.

So substituting λ: the matrix becomes:

[ nz*(ħ/2) - ħ/2 , nx*(ħ/2)        ]
[ nx*(ħ/2)       , -nz*(ħ/2) - ħ/2 ]

Wait, actually, let me write it more clearly. The matrix P - λ I is:
