Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, right. Let me try to break this down.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So I'm looking for the eigenvector corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Oh right, the operator P is probably the angular momentum operator, but scaled by ħ/2. Because in quantum mechanics, spin-½ particles like electrons or muons have spin operators S_x, S_y, S_z with eigenvalues ±ħ/2. So here, P might be analogous to the spin operator.

So P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ are the Pauli matrices? Let me check the given components.

The P_x component is (ħ/2) times a matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix. So yeah, P must be like the spin operator for a spin-½ system.

Wait, but the operator is given along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, meaning the angle θ would be between 0 and π/2, or something like that. So the operator can be written as P = ħ/2 (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z), but since n lies in x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Wait, because in spherical coordinates, if it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is 0. So θ is the polar angle, from the z-axis.

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, the direction vector n can be represented as (n_x, n_y, n_z) with n_y=0. So the unit vector n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But if it's in the x-z plane, then φ is zero, so n becomes (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, no, wait. I think I might have gotten that mixed up. Because for polar angles, θ is measured from the z-axis. So in the x-z plane, the projection onto x is sinθ, and z is cosθ. So yes, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the direction is along (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P is proportional to the Pauli matrices in the direction of n. So P = (ħ/2) [ ( sinθ σ_x ) + (0) σ_y + (cosθ) σ_z ].

Wait, but the problem says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator would be proportional to the component of the Pauli matrices in that
