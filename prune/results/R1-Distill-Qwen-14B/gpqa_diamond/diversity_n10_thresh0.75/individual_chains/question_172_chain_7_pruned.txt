Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I think that means I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

I remember the Boltzmann distribution formula relates the number of particles in different energy states to the temperature. The formula is something like n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in states i and j, g is the degeneracy, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given. Let's call the higher energy level as i and the lower as j. So E_i - E_j is 1.38e-23 J. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. I'm not exactly sure what that means. Oh wait, the number of atoms in the excited state relative to another state. So if in star 1, the number is twice that of star 2 for a particular energy level.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the ratio of the number of excited atoms in the higher level to the lower level is different between the two stars. So for star 1, the ratio is twice that of star 2. Or perhaps that the excitation is higher, meaning more atoms are in the higher energy state compared to the lower. Hmm, the question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So maybe for that specific level, say level E_2 (excited), the population is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "twice as excited", which could refer to the excitation being higher, meaning the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher. So perhaps for each star, the ratio is given by the Boltz
