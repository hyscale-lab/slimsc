Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let's start breaking it down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of different energy levels in a system in thermal equilibrium.

So the Boltzmann equation is probably involved here. The equation goes like this: the ratio of populations of two energy states is proportional to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.

Mathematically, it's n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). But wait, in this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me jot that down: ΔE = 1.38 x 10^-23 J.

Wait, but the problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the population in the excited state is twice that of star_2. Let me think. So for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state (or some lower state) is given by the Boltzmann factor.

Let me denote the excited state as level i and the lower state as level j. So for star 1: n_i^1 / n_j^1 = exp( -ΔE / (k T1) ). Same for star 2: n_i^2 / n_j^2 = exp( -ΔE / (k T2) ).

But according to the problem, n_i^1 / n_j^1 = 2 * (n_i^2 / n_j^2). Wait, no, the problem says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. Hmm, so maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, wait. The problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation level is higher, meaning that the population in the excited state is higher in star_1.

So if star_1's population is twice that of star_2's, then (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) = 2 * (n_i^2)/(n_j^2). Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Because the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) = 2 * (n_i^2)/(n_j^2).

But wait, let me think again. Let me define the ratio for each star as R1 = (n_i^1)/(n_j^1) and R2 = (n_i^2)/(n_j^2). The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2.

So, R1 = 2 R2.

But according to Boltzmann, R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So,

R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)),

R2
