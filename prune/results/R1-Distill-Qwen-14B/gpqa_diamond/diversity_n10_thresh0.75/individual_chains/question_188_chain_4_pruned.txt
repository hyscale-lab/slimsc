Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically something to do with interplanar distances in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says the crystal is rhombohedral with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A through D, all around 9 or 10 Angstroms.

Wait, interatomic distance... I think that refers to the distance between atoms in the crystal structure. In a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, right? Because in a rhombohedral lattice, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a three-dimensional figure formed by six rhombi. So the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, no, in a rhombohedral system, all edges are equal (a = b = c), and all angles are equal too? Or is that a different type of crystal system? Wait, maybe in a cubic system, but no. Let me get this right.

Wait, the Miller indices are (111), so that's a plane cutting the axes at (1,1,1). The interplanar distance formula for a crystal structure is given by the formula 1/d^2 = (h² + k
