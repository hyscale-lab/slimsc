Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with moving charges, both electric and magnetic fields come into play, and potentials are involved. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). At a certain time tr, the charge is at a position, and the vector d is from that position to the observation point r. The velocity at time tr is v. We need to find the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t where t > tr, so the charge has moved on.

Wait, potentials. I remember that in electrodynamics, the potentials are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential contributes to the magnetic field. Oh right, the electric field E can be written as the gradient of V minus the time derivative of A, and the magnetic field B is the curl of A.

But wait, for a moving charge, the potentials would depend on the charge's position and velocity at some earlier time. Because the fields at the observation point r are due to the charge's motion at an earlier time tr, considering the time it takes for the fields to propagate at the speed of light.

So the general expressions for the potentials from a moving charge would involve the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time tr. The retarded time is when the light would have left the charge to reach the observer, so tr = (r - d)/c, but maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Vector d is from the charge's position at tr to r, so d = r - s(tr). Wait, the vector d is r - s(tr), so the distance is |d| = r, but I'm not sure. Anyway, the key point is that the potentials depend on the charge's state at tr.

The scalar potential V for a point charge at rest is given by Coulomb's law: V = q/(4πε0 r), where r is the distance from the charge to the point of observation. But when the charge is moving, we have to consider the retarded time. So the distance isn't just r but maybe something else.

Wait, but the options don't have r in the denominator directly except in options A and B. Options C and D have terms involving dc and d·v. Hmm, so for a moving charge, the scalar potential might not just be 1/r anymore because of the motion. Wait, but for a charge moving at a constant velocity, the electric field still looks like the Coulomb field at the retarded position, but the potential might be similar.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge at the retarded time is given by V = q/(4πε0 (d)), where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the point r. So in terms of d, which is r - s(tr), but in the options, they have terms like dc and d·v. Wait, maybe the denominator has a term that accounts for the relative motion.

Wait, another thought: when a charge is moving, the potentials are affected. The vector potential A is related to the velocity of the charge. Oh right, the vector potential due to a moving charge is given by A = (μ0 q v)/(4π) * (some terms), maybe involving the velocity and the distance.

Let me think: the scalar potential is usually the Coulomb potential, but when considering the retarded time, it's evaluated at tr. So if the charge was at position s(tr), then the distance from there to r is d. So V should be q/(4πε0 d) multiplied by a term that accounts for any time delays or velocity factors.

Wait, wait, but in the case of a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials might have more terms. Let me recall. From the Liénard's equations or the retarded potentials.

The scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by V(r, t) = [q/(4πε0)] * [1/|r' - r|_t], where r' is the position of the charge at the retarded time. Alternatively, considering the charge is at a distance d from the observation point, the denominator might be d, but perhaps modified by some term involving velocity.

Wait, maybe the denominator is d multiplied by some factor. Let's think in terms of Lorentz transformations or the effect of motion on the potentials.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential is similar to the Coulomb potential but scaled by a factor due to the velocity. Or wait, maybe the denominator isn't just d but something like (d ± v t'), but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, option C has V = (q c)/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)) and A being (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). Similarly, option D has similar terms but with a plus sign.

Wait, so for potentials, the denominator might involve terms like (d c - vector d·vector v), because that's the relative motion.

Wait, I think the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V = (q)/(4πε0) * [1/(d - (d·v)/c²)] multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d·v)).

Wait, no, actually, the denominator in the scalar potential when considering motion is (d c - (d·v)) divided by c²? Or perhaps the denominator is (d c - vector d · vector v), which is a scalar.

Wait, let's think about the expression for the scalar potential. The standard expression when a charge is moving is that the scalar potential is V = q/(4πε0 (r - (v t)/c²)), but wait, that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I think the denominator is (r - (v t))/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)), but that's getting into relativistic terms which might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the potentials due to a charge in motion can be found using the retarded time concept. The potentials depend on the charge's position and velocity at time tr, the retarded time. The vector d is from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r.

So the scalar potential V is given by (q)/(4πε0) times 1 over |d|, but wait, that's only if the charge is at rest. But when the charge is moving, we have to consider the velocity as well. Or perhaps, the scalar potential is the same as the Coulomb potential at the retarded time, so V = q/(4πε0 d), but the vector potential has a term involving the velocity.

Wait, the vector potential for a point charge is given by A = (μ0 q)/(4π) (v × (d)) / (d² c²), but wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the vector potential for a moving charge is given by A = (μ0 q)/(4π) [ (v × (r - s(tr)) ) ] / ( (r - s(tr))² c² ), but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the vector potential is A = (μ0 q v)/(4π c²) [ (d · v) / (d c) ) ] ?

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the general form of the potentials.

The scalar potential V(r, t) due to a charge q moving with velocity v at the retarded time tr is:

V(r, t) = ( q / (4πε0) ) * [ 1 / ( |d| ) ] * [ 1 / ( 1 - (v·d)/(c |d|) ) ]

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the denominator might have a term involving d and the velocity.

Wait, I think the correct expression for the scalar potential when the charge is moving is:

V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε0) ] * [ 1 / ( (d / c) - (v·d)/(c²) ) ]

Because the denominator is the time it takes for the field to propagate, adjusted for the motion. So the denominator is (d - (v t_r) ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by V = q/(4πε0) * [ 1/(d - (v t_r) ) ] but when considering the speed of light, t_r = (distance)/(c), which is d/(c). So substituting, the denominator becomes d - (v (d/c)) ) = d (1 - (v·d)/(c d) ) )? Wait, but that's just d (1 - (v·d)/(c d)) = d (1 - (v·d̂)/c), but I don't know if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, the expression might involve terms like (d c - vector d · vector v). Let me think, the denominator could be (d c - (v · d)), where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

Looking at the options, option C has (d c - d·v) in the denominator for V, and similarly for A. So let's think about that.

So V would be [ q c ] / [4πε0 (d c - d·v) ]

Similarly, the vector potential A would have terms with v, so perhaps (μ0 q c v) / [4π (d c - d·v) ]

Which matches option C.

Wait, but why would V have a factor of c in the numerator? Because when using units where c is involved, sometimes potentials have factors of c when multiplied by other terms. Let me think about the units.

The scalar potential V has units of volts (V), which is J/C. So let's check the units of option C's V: [q c ] / [ (distance) * ... ].

q is in Coulombs (C), c is m/s. So numerator is C * m/s. Denominator is (distance * something). Hmm, denominator is (d c - d·v ). But d·v has units of (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So d c is m * m/s = m²/s. So the denominator is in m²/s, same for both terms. So the denominator is m²/s.

So overall, V would be (C * m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m), which is correct because (C/(m)) is equivalent to (C·N·s²/C² m) → V is in volts, which is correct.

For the vector potential A, which is in Tesla·m (or Weber/m² * m ), but let's see. Option C's A is [ μ0 q c v ] / [4π (d c - d·v) ]

μ0 has units of H/m (henrys per meter). H is kg·m²/(s²·A²). So μ0 is kg·m/(s²·A²).

q is C, c is m/s, v is m/s. So numerator is kg·m/(s²·A²) * C * m/s * m/s.

Wait, C is equivalent to A·s. So substituting, numerator becomes kg·m/(s²·A²) * (A s) * (m/s) * (m/s) )

Let me compute that step by step:

μ0: kg·m/(s²·A²)
q: A·s
c: m/s
v: m/s

Multiply all together:

kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s * (m/s) * (m/s) 

= kg·m/(s²·A²) * A s * m²/s²

= kg·m * A s * m² / (s²·A² s² )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute the units step by step:

μ0 q c v → [kg·m/(s²·A²)] * [A s] * [m/s] * [m/s] 

Multiply the units:

kg·m/(s²·A²) × A s = kg·m/(s²·A²) × A s = kg·m/(s^2) × (1/A^2 × A s) ) → kg·m/(s^2) × s/(A) → kg·m/(s A)

Then multiply by c (m/s):

kg·m/(s A) × m/s = kg·m²/(s² A)

Multiply by v (m/s):

kg·m²/(s² A) × m/s = kg·m³/(s^3 A)

Denominator is (d c - d·v) → same as numerator's denominator, which is m²/s.

So overall, A has units (kg·m³/(s^3 A)) / (m²/s) ) = (kg·m³/(s^3 A) ) * s/(m²) ) = kg·m/(s² A)

Which is the correct unit for vector potential A (since 1 Tesla is kg/(s² A), and A is Tesla·meter).

So the units check out for option C.

Now, what about the scalar potential and vector potential expressions in the other options?

Option A: V is the Coulomb potential, and A is proportional to v squared. But that doesn't make sense because the vector potential should involve the velocity, not the square of velocity. So A would be quadratic in v, but potentials are linear in the charge's motion. So I think option A is incorrect.

Option B: V is the Coulomb potential, but A is proportional to v divided by c squared. That seems possible, but I'm not sure if the denominator is correctly capturing the motion. Also, I thought the denominator in V should involve (dc - d·v), which isn't present here. So option B might be incorrect.

Options C and D both have denominators with (dc ± d·v). The difference is whether it's a minus or a plus. I have to decide which one it is.

Wait, when the charge is moving towards the observer, the potential might be different. Let me think about the direction. The vector d is from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So if the charge is moving in the same direction as d, the denominator in V would have (dc - d·v) where d·v is positive if v is in the same direction as d. Which would make the denominator smaller, leading to a larger V. Alternatively, if the charge is moving away, d·v is negative, so (dc - d·v) becomes larger, making V smaller.

Wait, but in reality, the potentials should account for the time it takes for the field to reach the observer. So if the charge is moving away, the effective distance increases, so the potential decreases. So let's say d is the distance at time tr, but the charge is moving, so the actual path might differ.

Wait, I think the denominator in the potentials should subtract the component of velocity in the direction of d because the charge is moving, so we have to adjust for that. So (d c - d·v) would be the correct denominator, leading to option C.

Alternatively, let's think about the expression for V. The scalar potential is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε0) * [ 1/(d - (v t_r)) ]

Wait, no, the proper way is to use the retarded time, tr, where t_r = (r - d)/c, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the denominator would involve (d - (v t_r)), but that's getting a bit complicated.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. The scalar potential for a point charge moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε0) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v · d̂)/c ) ) ]

So d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r. d̂ is the unit vector in the direction of d.

But in terms of the actual expression, this would lead to a denominator involving (d c - (v · d)), because (v · d) is v d cosθ, and d c would be the product of d and c.

So yes, the denominator is (d c - (v · d)).

So the scalar potential is V = (q c)/(4πε0 (d c - (v · d))).

Wait, why the numerator is q c? Because when you have V, it's often scaled by c to get the right units. Let me think: the standard Coulomb potential is q/(4πε0 r), which has units of V. When the charge is moving, the denominator would have an extra factor involving velocity and distance, but perhaps the numerator is multiplied by c to maintain the correct units.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The standard Coulomb potential is V = q/(4πε0 r). If in the moving case, the denominator becomes (d c - d·v), then V would have units of [ q ] / [ (distance * c - (distance * velocity)) ]. Let's think in terms of units.

Each term in the denominator must have the same units. distance is in meters, c is m/s, velocity is m/s. So distance*c is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. Similarly, distance * velocity is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So the denominator is m²/s, same for both terms.

The numerator is q, which is Coulombs (C). So V = C / (m²/s) ) = C s/m².

But the unit of V (volts) is J/C = (N m)/C = (kg m²/s²) * s / C = kg m²/(s C). Wait, that doesn't match C s/m². Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute the units for option C:

V = (q c) / (4πε0 (d c - d · v) )

q has units C, c is m/s. So numerator: C * m/s.

Denominator: (d c) is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. (d · v) is (m)(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s.

So overall, units are (C * m/s) / (m^2/s) )= (C m/s) * (s/m²) )= C/(m).

Which is correct because 1 Volt is 1 J/C = (N m)/C = (kg m²/s²) * m / C → kg m³/(s² C), wait no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, 1 V is 1 J/C, and J is kg m²/s². So 1 V is kg m²/(s² C). Hmm, but the units from option C's V are C/(m), which is C m^{-1}.

Wait, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the unit analysis. Maybe option C's units are off.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the standard scalar potential. Its unit is volts, which is J/C.

Option C's V is (q c) / denominator.

q is C, c is m/s. denominator is (d c - d · v), with units m²/s.

So V = (C * m/s) / (m²/s) ) → (C m/s) * (s/m²) ) = C/(m). Which, as I said, is C/m. Which is not the same as volts (J/C).

Wait, so this suggests that option C's units are wrong. Because 1 V is 1 J/C = 1 (N m)/C = 1 (kg m/s² * m)/C = kg m²/(s² C). So option C's V has units C/m, which doesn't match Volts. So maybe option C is incorrect.

Hmm, that's a problem. Which suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is V = q/(4πε0) [1/(d (1 - (v · d̂)/c)))] = [ q / (4πε0 d) ] [ 1 / (1 - (v · d̂)/c) ]

But 1/(1 - (v·d̂)/c) is approximately 1 + (v·d̂)/c when v is much smaller than c, which is the non-relativistic limit. So in that case, V ≈ [q/(4πε0 d)] [ 1 + (v · d̂)/c ].

But how does that translate into the given options? None of the options seem to directly match that, except perhaps option C when c is in the numerator.

Wait, maybe I should go back to the basics. The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q) / (4πε0) * [ 1 / ( |r - s(tr)| ) ] * [ 1 / (1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/(c |r - s(tr)|) ) ]

Which can be rewritten as [ q ] / [4πε0 ( |r - s(tr)| (1 - (v · (r - s(tr)) )/(c |r - s(tr)|) )) ) ]

Let me let d = |r - s(tr)|. Then, (v · (r - s(tr))) = v d cosθ, where θ is the angle between v and d.

So the denominator becomes d (1 - (v d cosθ)/(c d )) ) = d (1 - (v cosθ)/c )

So V = q/(4πε0 d (1 - (v cosθ)/c )) )

But none of the options have this form. However, option C has denominator (d c - d · v ) = d c - v d cosθ = d (c - v cosθ )

So V = q/(4πε0) * 1/(d (c - v cosθ)/c ) ) = q c/(4πε0) * 1/(d (c - v cosθ) )

Wait, that's exactly option C's expression for V, because d c - d · v = d (c - v cosθ ), so V would be (q c)/(4πε0 (d c - d · v )).

Which matches option C.

Now, the units. V has units (C * m/s ) / (m^2/s ) ) → (C m/s ) * s/(m² ) ) = C/(m) → which is not correct because V should be in volts (J/C). Hmm, this is a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express it correctly. Let me compute the units again.

Option C's V: numerator is q c → C*(m/s). Denominator is (d c - d · v ) → (m * m/s ) - (m * m/s ) → (m²/s ) - (m²/s ) → same units. So denominator is m²/s.

So V has units (C * m/s ) / ( m²/s ) ) → (C * m/s ) * (s/m² ) ) → C/(m ). But that's not correct. Volts are (kg m²)/(C s²). So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/c somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct expression for V when considering motion is:

V(r, t) = (q)/(4πε0) [ 1/(d (1 - (v cosθ)/c )) ]

Which can be rewritten as [ q ] / [4πε0 (d - (v cosθ d ) / c ) ]

Because (d (1 - (v cosθ)/c )) = d - (v cosθ d )/c.

Wait, so denominator is d (1 - (v cosθ)/c ) = d - (v cosθ d )/c = d [ c - v cosθ ] / c.

Wait, so V = [ q ] / [4πε0 * (d (c - v cosθ )) / c ) ] = [ q c ] / [4πε0 d (c - v cosθ ) ]

Which is [ q c ] / [4πε0 (d c - d · v ) ]

Which matches option C. So the expression is correct.

But the unit analysis made me confused earlier. Let me see: q has units C. c is m/s. d is m. So denominator is (m * m/s - m * m/s ) = m²/s. So numerator is C * m/s.

So V has units (C * m/s ) / (m²/s ) )= C/(m), which is not correct. Wait, but this can't be right because V is in volts, not C/m. So I must have made a mistake in the unit analysis.

Wait, no, let me re-calculate the units.

Denominator: d c has units m * m/s → m²/s.

d · v is m * m/s → m²/s.

So denominator is (m²/s + m²/s ) → m²/s.

Numerator: q c is C*(m/s).

So V's units: (C m/s ) / (m²/s ) ) → (C m/s ) * (s/m² ) → C/(m).

But volts are J/C → (kg m²/s²)/C. So the units don't match. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I forgot that ε0 has units. Right, ε0 is in F/m (farads per meter). So the denominator in V would have units (d c - d · v) = m²/s, but when multiplied by 4πε0, which has units (F/m), which is (C²/(N m²)).

Wait, let me compute the units of option C's V.

Option C:
V = (q c) / [4πε0 (d c - d · v) ]

q → C
c → m/s
ε0 → F/m = C²/(N m²)
d → m
v → m/s

So denominator units: [d c - d · v ] = m*(m/s) → m²/s.

So V has units:

(C * m/s) / [ (C²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) ] 

Because 4πε0 has units C²/(N m²).

So compute denominator inside the fraction:

[ C²/(N m²) ) * (m²/s) ) ] → C²/(N s )

So V's units: (C * m/s ) / ( C²/(N s) ) ) → (C m/s ) * (N s ) / C² ) → (m/s ) * (N s ) / C → (m N ) / C.

But N is kg m/s², so:

(m * kg m/s² ) / C → kg m²/(s² C )

Which is exactly the unit of volts (V = J/C = (kg m²/s²)/C ).

So the units do work out. I must have messed up the unit analysis earlier by forgetting about ε0's units.

So, going back, the correct expression is option C: V has (q c)/(4πε0 (d c - d ·v)), and A is (μ0 q c v)/(4π (d c - d ·v )).

Wait, but what about the vector potential A? Let's see: the vector potential is usually proportional to the velocity.

In option C, A is (μ0 q c v )/(4π (d c - d·v )).

The units for A should be Tesla·meter (since A is vector potential, which has the unit of T·m). Let's check.

μ0 has units H/m = kg·m/(s²·A²).

q is C = A·s.

v is m/s.

So numerator: μ0 * q * c * v → (kg·m/(s²·A² )) * (A·s) * (m/s) * (m/s )

Let me compute step by step:

μ0: kg·m/(s² A² )
q: A s
c: m/s
v: m/s

Multiply these together:

kg·m/(s² A²) * A s = kg·m/(s² A²) * A s = kg·m/(s A) * 1/(A) * A s → kg·m/(s A) 

Wait, let me compute it properly:

μ0 * q = (kg·m/(s² A² )) * (A s ) = kg·m/(s² A² ) * A s = kg m s/(s² A ) ) → kg m/(s A )

Multiply by c (m/s ): kg m/(s A ) * m/s = kg m²/(s² A )

Multiply by v (m/s ): kg m²/(s² A ) * m/s = kg m^3/(s^3 A )

Denominator in A is (d c - d·v ) → m²/s.

So A's overall units would be [kg m³/(s^3 A ) ] / [ m²/s ] = kg m/(s^2 A )

Which is the unit of T·m since T is kg/(s² A ). So yes, units check out.

So both V and A expressions in option C have correct units, and the expressions make sense.

In that case, the correct answer is option C.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a point charge \( q \) moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \), we analyze the given options based on the retarded potential formalism in electrodynamics.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a moving charge depends on the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time \( t_r \). The retarded time accounts for the finite speed of light \( c \), and the distance between the charge's position at \( t_r \) and the observation point \( \vec{r} \) is represented by the vector \( \vec{d} \).
   - The correct expression for \( V \) must include a term in the denominator that accounts for the motion of the charge, typically of the form \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), where \( d = |\vec{d}| \). This ensures the correct relativistic adjustment for the charge's motion.
   - Option C provides \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), which matches the expected form of the scalar potential for a moving charge. The units also check out, as the numerator has units of charge \( q \) and speed \( c \), while the denominator has units of \( m^2/s \), leading to the correct unit of volts (V).

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and depends on the same denominator \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \) as the scalar potential. The presence of \( \mu_0 \) in the numerator is consistent with the role of the permeability of free space in electromagnetic potentials.
   - Option C provides \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v})} \), which is consistent with the expected form of the vector potential. The units also verify correctly, as the numerator has units of \( \mu_0 q c \vec{v} \), and the denominator has units of \( m^2/s \), leading to the correct unit of Tesla·meter (T·m).

3. **Elimination of Other Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the linear dependence of \( \vec{A} \) on \( \vec{v} \) in the retarded potential formalism.
   - **Option B:** While the scalar potential \( V \) matches the Coulomb potential, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not align with the expected form of the vector potential for a moving charge.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) is \( d c + \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \), which is inconsistent with the correct relativistic adjustment \( d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v} \).

### Conclusion:
Option C correctly captures the scalar and vector potentials for a moving charge, including the proper relativistic adjustment for the charge's motion. Both the mathematical form and the units are consistent with the retarded potential formalism in electrodynamics.

**Answer: C**
