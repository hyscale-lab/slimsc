Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which molecule forms when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting material is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me try to draw its structure. Nonane means nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, nona-2,6-diene: positions 2 and 6 have double bonds. So the structure should be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, nona is nine carbons, so numbering from 1 to 9. So 2 and 6 are the double bond positions. So between 2-3 and 6-7.

But wait, no. Wait, I think I got that wrong. Nonane has 9 carbons. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9

So the double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. But wait, that can't be right because that would have single bonds in between.

Wait, but the compound is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Oh wait, butylnona implies a substituent. So 5-butyl means that on the 5th carbon of the nona-diene, there's a butyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The nona chain is 9 carbons, with double bonds at 2 and 6. The 5th carbon (position 5 of the nona chain) has a butyl group attached. So the structure would be something like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3. Wait, wait, no. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene: the main chain is non
