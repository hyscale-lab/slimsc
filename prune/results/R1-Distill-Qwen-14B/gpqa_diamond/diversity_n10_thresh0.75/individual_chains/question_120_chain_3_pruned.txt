Okay, so I have this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax of a star is the angle subtended by the star at the ends of the baseline of an observer's measurements. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So, if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and vice versa.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. The options are all different dependencies on 1/plx raised to some power.

Wait, so they're asking for the number density in terms of parallax. Let me think about the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So, if I consider a small volume element, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to the volume itself.

But how does parallax relate to the volume? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So higher parallax means closer stars. If I have a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what does that correspond to in terms of distance?

Distance d is 1/plx. So, d = 1/plx. Then, if plx increases by dplx, the change in distance would be dd = (d(plx)/dplx) * dplx. Wait, let's compute that derivative. d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx^2) dplx. So, a small change in plx leads to a change in
