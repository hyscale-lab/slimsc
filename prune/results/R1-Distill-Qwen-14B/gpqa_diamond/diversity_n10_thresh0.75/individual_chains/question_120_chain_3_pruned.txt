Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of stars. Let me think about this.

Parallax, right, it's the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance in parsecs is 1 divided by parallax (plx), so distance d = 1/plx. So a star with a parallax of 1 parsec is very close, only 1 parsec away, and a star with a parallax of 0.001 parsecs is much farther, 1000 parsecs away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? If they're uniformly distributed in space, that would mean the number density of stars is constant throughout the volume. But wait, the options are about how the number per unit parallax range changes. So I need to relate the number of stars to the parallax.

Let me think about volume. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So as parallax increases, the distance decreases. Now, if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d would depend on the volume of that shell. The volume of a thin shell is approximately 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness of the shell. But since the parallax plx is 1/d, that means d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that in.

So the volume of the shell is 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (d d). But since d is 1/plx, dd would be a small change in d. Let me express dd in terms of plx. If d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, so a change in plx leads to a change in d. Wait, maybe it's easier to express the shell volume in terms of plx.

Alternatively, let's think in terms of the number of stars per unit volume, which is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec. The number of stars in a thin shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx would be the volume of that shell multiplied by n.

The volume of the shell is 4πd² * dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. But
