Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The problem says: We have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the standard basis for spin-½ particles.

Then, we're asked to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of an operator whose matrix representation A has elements A_ij. The rule is A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, that's a bit confusing. So for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements would be zero, and the off-diagonal elements (where i≠j) would be hbar/2. So A would look like [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

Wait, no, the way A_ij is defined: A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Oh, right, because when i=1, j=2, and vice versa. So this matrix represents the operator that swaps the |up> and |down> states, scaled by ħ/2.

But wait, wait. No, the operator itself might be something else. Let me think about what this operator represents. The matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]], so that's ħ/2 times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) * sigma_x. So the operator we're dealing with is proportional to the spin-x operator.

Wait, but the spin operators usually have different scaling. Spin-x is (ħ/2) sigma_x, so yes, this operator A is exactly the spin-x operator. So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction, right?

So, the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> +
