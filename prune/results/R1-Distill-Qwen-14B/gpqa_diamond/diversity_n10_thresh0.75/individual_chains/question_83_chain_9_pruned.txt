Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I should figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Then, when titrated with NaOH, I need to calculate the pH at two specific points: 25% of the titration and at the equivalence point.

Let me break this down.

Step 1: Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20.00 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 mL of water. So the total volume becomes 40.00 mL.

The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL. V2 is 40 mL. So M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2.

Calculating that: (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Step 2: Determine the equivalence point.

When titrating acetic acid (a weak acid) with NaOH (a strong base), the equivalence point will be when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) after dilution: M2 * V_total? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the initial moles before dilution were M1 * V1. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 mL is 0.02 L) = 0.001 moles.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, when we diluted, we added 20 mL of water to the 20 mL of acetic acid. So the total volume is 40 mL.

So the diluted solution has 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Because M = moles/volume (L). So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. So moles of NaOH at equivalence = 0.001 moles.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, volume needed is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 mL.

So the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added.

But wait, the question says 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

So, at 25% titration, we have added 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH to the diluted acetic acid solution.

Now, for each of these points (25% and equivalence), I need to calculate the pH.

Let me tackle each part:

First, the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH →
