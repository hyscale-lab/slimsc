Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The problem is about titrating a solution of acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate it with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, it dissociates more, so the pH should go up a bit. Then, when titrated with a strong base, the pH will change depending on how much base has been added.

First, I think I need to calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 mL, and we add 20 mL of water, so the total volume becomes 40 mL (0.04 L). The moles of acetic acid initially are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, 20 mL and 20 mL added—so 40 mL total. So yeah, that part is correct. So the diluted concentration is 0.025 M.

Now, moving on to the titration part. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So I need to find the equivalence point. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid: 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So moles NaOH = M × V. Since moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So the equivalence point is at 10 mL of NaOH added.

The question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence point, so 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL. So at 2.5 mL added, I'm at 25% titration.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of moles. Because sometimes when you add a strong base to a weak acid, the amount of neutralization depends on the moles, not just the volume. So, the 25% titration point is when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

But let me think: when you add 2.5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, how many moles is that? Moles NaOH = 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since the moles of acetic acid are 0.001, 0.00025 is 25% of that. So yeah, that's correct. So at 2.5 mL, 25% titration has occurred.

So for the first part, at 25% titration, which is the first pH value.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming sodium acetate. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is the salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will be basic. The pH will be greater than 7.

Now, let's tackle each part step by step.

First, the 25% titration point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, initially, 0.001 mol of acetic acid. So 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So, moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume of the solution is the initial 40 mL plus the 2.5 mL NaOH added. So 42.5 mL (0.0425 L).

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

pKa = -log(Ka) = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ Let's calculate that.

1.85e-5 → log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so 0.267 -5 = -4.733 → pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.

So about 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value. Option D has 4.57, which is higher, so maybe another approach. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the buffer calculation.

Wait, wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Let me compute the ratio again: 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

Wait, no, because [A-] is 0.00025 mol in 0.0425 L: so 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.
