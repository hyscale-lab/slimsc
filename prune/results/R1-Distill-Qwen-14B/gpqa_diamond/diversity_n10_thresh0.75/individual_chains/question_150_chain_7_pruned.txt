Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. Okay, the compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's a start. Then there's the NMR data, which I should look at closely.

The NMR shows:
- 9.72 ppm, a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a pretty high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton? Or perhaps something else, like an aromatic ring with certain substituents?
- 6.98 ppm, a doublet of 2H. So aromatic protons. Maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Like if there's a substituent on the benzene, the neighboring protons would split into a doublet.
- 6.51 ppm, another doublet of 2H. Maybe the other set of aromatic protons, perhaps the ortho positions to a substituent. Wait, but if it's a para-substituted ring, wouldn't these be a pair of doublets? Hmm, not sure yet.
- 6.27 ppm, a broad singlet of 2H. Broad suggests maybe some exchange, like -OH protons, but wait, in the NMR, that's usually around 1-5 ppm. Or maybe it's not -OH. Alternatively, it could be vinyl protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. Like in an enal? Or maybe they're part of an aromatic ring but in a different environment.
- 3.66 ppm, a doublet of 2H. This looks like a methylene group attached to something. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen or nitrogen.

Wait, let me think. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, one oxygen. The NMR has 1H + 2H + 2H + 2H + 2H = 9 H in total. Oh wait, 1+2+2+2+2=9. Yep, that matches.

Let me try to sketch a structure based on this. The triplet at 9.72 is a high shift, maybe an aldehyde. Let's say a prochiral aldehyde. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde group. Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets suggest two sets of aromatic protons. If I have two aromatic rings, perhaps each with two protons each as doublets, that could mean each ring is para-substituted. Wait, but the molecule has molecular formula C8H9NO, which includes the substituents.

Wait, wait. Let me think of a possible structure. Maybe the compound has an aldehyde group and two aromatic rings connected via a chain. Let's think of a structure like benzaldehyde derivatives.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: That sounds like nitrous acid conditions. Usually, this is used for diazotization of aromatic amines. So the starting compound probably has an aromatic amine group. Because sodium nitrite and HCl are used to make diazonium salts, typically from aromatic amines.

So the starting compound has an aromatic ring with an amine group. Then, step 2 is H2O. That's just water, maybe hydrolysis. Step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat, which suggests some kind of elimination or nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, if the starting material is an aromatic amine, perhaps a primary aromatic amine, then upon diazotization, it would form a diazonium salt. Then, when treated with water (H2O, step 2), it undergoes hydrolysis. Diazonium salts in aqueous acid or base can undergo hydrolysis to form phenols or other products. If the amine is in a specific position, perhaps this leads to the formation of a carbocation or some structure that can undergo elimination.

Alternatively, if the diazonium salt is treated with water, it might undergo a substitution. For example, if the diazonium group is attached to a benzene ring that's part of a larger structure, perhaps the diazonium group leaves, forming a carbocation which could then rearrange.

Wait, but let's also think about the NMR. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. So maybe the compound has an aldehyde group. So perhaps the structure is something like a diphenyl structure connected via a chain that includes an aldehyde.

Wait, considering the molecular formula C8H9NO. Let's calculate degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5 degrees. So 5 degrees: maybe a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond? Or maybe the benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a carbonyl group (1). Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet for 1H at 9.72, which is high, so likely an aldehyde. So that's a carbonyl group (C=O). Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets suggest another benzene ring, perhaps with substituents.

So perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde with another substituent. Wait, but it's C8H9NO. Let me think: benzene rings are 6
