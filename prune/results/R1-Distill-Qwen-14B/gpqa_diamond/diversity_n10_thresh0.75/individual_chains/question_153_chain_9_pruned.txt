Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them with the options provided.

Starting with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). So I remember that the Michael addition is a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound.

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, right? It's like a dienolate. The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So this has an alpha-beta unsaturated ester group. The structure would be CH2CO-CH2-p-tolyl, but wait, no, the acrylate would be CH2=CHCO2Me. Oh wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think: 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me? Or is it CH2=CH-CO2Me with a p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon?

Wait, no, I think the structure is more like CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group attached to the middle CH. Hmm. Let me try to draw it. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but in this case, the substituent is on the middle carbon. So it's CH2-C(=O)-OEt, but with a CH2 group attached to the middle. Wait, maybe I should think of it as CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, wait, the position is 3, so for acrylate, which is CH2=CHCO2R, the substituent is on the third position. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? Or maybe CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl on the CH2 before the acrylate? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong, but perhaps I should proceed.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So the attack would be on the CH2 in CH2=CH-C-OEt with a p-tolyl group. So the enolate of dimethyl malonate would attack the middle CH2 carbon, leading to the addition.

So when dimethyl malonate (which is a dienolate) attacks the acrylate, the product would have the malonate part attached to the acrylate. So the acrylate would have a new substituent from the malonate. So the product would be a longer chain with ester groups.

I think the product would be something like CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OEt attached to the malonate. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Michael acceptor is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the acrylate. The nucleophile is the enolate of dimethyl malonate.

So when the enolate attacks, it adds to the beta carbon of the acrylate. So the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2 (so the structure is CH2(p-tolyl)=CH-CO-OEt? Or maybe the p-tolyl is on the middle carbon. Wait, the molecule is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So
