Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's start breaking it down.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, plugging in the numbers: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 =9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right because it should be an integer. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate: 2*8 is 16, plus 2 is 18. Minus H (9) gives 9. Plus N (1), so 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So 5 degrees. So that could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Like a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees) and some double bonds or another ring. Hmm.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H).

The 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and as a singlet, but sometimes coupling with adjacent groups can make it a triplet. Wait, but in this case, it's a triplet. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, could it be an acidic proton like a phenol? But phenolic protons are usually around 5 ppm, but maybe if it's more deshielded, like in a conjugated system. Or perhaps an enol proton? Or maybe a carbonyl adjacent to something else?

Wait, but the triplet suggests coupling with two protons. So, maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Because in an aldehyde, the proton is usually on the end, so if it's next to a CH2, like R-CHO, maybe the aldehyde proton isn't directly attached to the CH2, but perhaps part of a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system.

Looking at the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks. Those are typical for aromatic protons. Let's see: two doublets each integrating for 2H. So maybe that's a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if we have an aromatic ring with two substituents opposite each other, each substituent having two protons. So like a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Each substituent has two protons, and these are as doublets because of coupling with each other.

So the 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H) could be two para-substit
