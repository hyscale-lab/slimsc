Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to unpack it.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. I think this has to do with the particles moving and the time they have to decay before the chamber can detect them. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, time dilation comes into play because the particle is moving at a high speed.

So the formula I remember is the relativistic gamma factor, gamma equals the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which tells us how much time dilation occurs.

Let me calculate gamma first. The energy E is 27 GeV, and the rest mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = E / (m c²), but since both are in GeV, the c² factors cancel out in units where c=1. So gamma = 27 / 3.41.

Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28. Oh wait, that's almost 27. So 27 is approximately 8 times 3.41. So gamma is approximately 8. Because 3.41 *8 = 27.28, which is just a bit over 27, so maybe gamma is about 7.92 or something. But I can calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 3.41 * 8 =27.28. So 27 is 0.28 less than 27.28, which is 0.28/3.41 of 8. So 27/(3.41) is 8 - (0.28 /3.41)*8. Let me compute 0.28 /3.41. 3.41 is approx 3.4, 0.28/3.4 is about 0.08235. So 0.08235 *8 is 0.6588. So gamma is approximately 8 - 0.6588 ≈7.3412. Wait, no, wait: wait, 27 is the numerator. So 27 /3.41 = approx 7.917? Wait, no, wait: 3.41 *7.917 is 27? Let me compute 3.41 *7.917. 3.41 *7 = 23.87, 3.41 *0.917 is about 3.41*0.9=3.069, 3.41*0.017=0.05797. So 3.069 +0.05797=3.12697. So 23.87 +3.12697=26.99697, which is almost 27. So yes, gamma is approximately 7.917.

So gamma is about 7.917.

The lifetime in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime τ. So τ_lab = gamma * τ0.

So tau_lab is 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.
