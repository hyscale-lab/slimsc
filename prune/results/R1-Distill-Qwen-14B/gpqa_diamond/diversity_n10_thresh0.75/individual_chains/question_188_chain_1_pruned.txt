Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Hmm, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

Wait, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices. Oh right, the formula is d = (a) / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Or wait, maybe it's another form. Oh wait, I think the general formula for a rhombohedral system is a bit different because all the angles are the same.

Ah, right! In a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c (assuming it's rhombohedral), and all angles are equal. So the formula for the interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) would be d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α). Because in a rhombohedral structure, all the angles are the same, so the cos terms are the same for each pair.

Wait, but wait, in this problem, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, in a rhombohedral structure, sometimes the unit cell's edge length 'a' is the interatomic distance. But I'm not so sure. Wait, the interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the crystal structure. For a simple cubic structure, the edge length a would be equal to the interatomic distance, but in other structures, like hexagonal close-packed, it's different. So in this case, the problem says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps the unit cell edge length a is 10 Angstrom? Or is that not the case? Hmm, maybe I should think about that. But I'll proceed under the assumption that a is 10 Angstrom unless I find a reason not to.

So, the plane is (111). So h=1, k=1, l=1. The angles are all 30 degrees, so cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.866. 

Let me plug in the numbers. Let me compute the denominator first.

Denominator = sqrt( (1)^2 + (1)^2 + (1)^2 + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) + 2*(1)(1)*cos(30) )

Wait, that's h² + k² + l² plus 2hk cos α + 2hl cos α + 2kl cos α. So since h=k=l=1, and alpha is 30 degrees.

So compute each term:

h² +k² + l² = 1 +1 +1 =3.

2hk cos alpha: 2*1*1 * cos(30) = 2*(√3/2) = √3. Similarly for 2hl cos
