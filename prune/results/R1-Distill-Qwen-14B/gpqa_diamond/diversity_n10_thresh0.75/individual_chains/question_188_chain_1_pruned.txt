Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the formulas, but let me think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. 

First, I remember that the interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the formula d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), where a is the lattice parameter, and l, m, n are the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, wait. Wait, no, isn't the formula different for rhombohedral crystals? Because I thought that in a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, but rhombohedral has all angles equal but not necessarily 90. Oh right, in rhombohedral systems, the angles α, β, γ are all the same. In this case, they're all 30 degrees.

So the given values are: interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. But wait, wait. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, which is the lattice parameter 'a' in the case of a simple cubic structure. But in rhombohedral, it's a bit more complicated. Wait, no, in a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameter a is the edge length. So the interatomic distance here is a, so a = 10 Angstrom.

The plane is (11
