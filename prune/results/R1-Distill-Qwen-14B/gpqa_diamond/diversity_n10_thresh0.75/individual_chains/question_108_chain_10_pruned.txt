Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They also mention small values of m, which is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number for the orbital angular momentum, right? So m can be -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l-1, l. Since the problem says small m, maybe m is near 0. Not sure if that's relevant yet.

The problem is comparing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think is the paramagnetic coupling term here) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers. Oh, I remember that the wavelength λ is related to energy by the equation E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using that.

Let me outline what I need to do:

1. Calculate ΔE using the given wavelength.
2. Find the paramagnetic coupling term, which I think is related to the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic effect would be something like H = -μ·B. But wait, μ is the magnetic moment, which for an electron is μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (approx 2), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.
3. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be proportional to B times m. Since m is small, this might affect the magnitude.

Wait, but the problem says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism usually involves the interaction of the electron's magnetic moment with an external field. So for an atom, the magnetic moment is due to the electron's spin or orbital angular momentum. But in the case of paramagnetism, I think it's mainly the spin that contributes, especially for the hydrogen atom. Oh wait, no, in the hydrogen atom, the electron has both spin and orbital angular momentum. But perhaps in this context, the paramagnetic term refers to the spin-orbit coupling or the Zeeman effect due to the magnetic field.

Alternatively, the paramagnetic coupling term for an atom in a magnetic field is given by the Zeeman term. The energy shift due to the magnetic field is ΔE_Zeeman = -μ·B. For an electron with spin, μ = g_s μ_B m_s, where m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. But wait, in hydrogen, the fine structure includes the spin-orbit coupling, but this question is about the Zeeman effect due to an external field, not the internal magnetic fields.

Wait, maybe I should think about the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect. H_Zeeman = -μ·B. For a hydrogen atom, the magnetic moment is due to the electron's orbital angular momentum and spin. So μ = γ (L + 2S), where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. But perhaps for simplicity, they're considering just the orbital contribution or the dominant one.

Wait no, for the paramagnetic effect in atoms, the magnetic moment is primarily due to the electron's spin, especially for s-electrons, but
