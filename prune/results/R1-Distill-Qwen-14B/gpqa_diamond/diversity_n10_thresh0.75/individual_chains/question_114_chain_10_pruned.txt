Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and a reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. Now, when a ketone reacts with NaCN, I remember that nitriles can be formed through a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the conditions here. I think in the presence of a strong acid, maybe?

I recall that the formation of a cyanohydrin is when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with cyanide ions (CN-) in an acidic medium. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and water leaves, forming the cyanohydrin. So in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which looks like a cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. So the reagent A here should be an acid, maybe H3O+ or something similar. Because NaCN is providing the cyanide ions, and the acid catalyzes the reaction.

Looking at the options, for reagent A, options A and B suggest H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is also a source of H+ and SO3^2-. But isn't that usually used for reductions, like with aldehydes or ketones to form alcohols? Or wait, maybe in some other reactions. But in this case, we're adding CN-, so I'm thinking the acid is H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ either from option A or B.

Now moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it reacts with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid
