Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions, and we need to pick the right reagents (A and B) for each step. The options are given as A, B, C, D with different combinations.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, ketones can undergo nucleophilic substitution or addition. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, maybe it's a cyano addition?

Wait no, I think that ketones can undergo addition reactions with nucleophiles. So, maybe the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone. But wait, in that case, the product would be a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with CN- under certain conditions.

So, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the formula given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure is (CH2CH2C(OH)(CN)CH3?), wait no, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Hmm, no, wait.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, no, wait butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO.
