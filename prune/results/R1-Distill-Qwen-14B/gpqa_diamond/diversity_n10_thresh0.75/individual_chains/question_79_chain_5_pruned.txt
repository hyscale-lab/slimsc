Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what compound X is. The question gives me the molecular formula, the reaction conditions, and the NMR data of the product. Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the compound X has the formula C11H12O. So, that's 11 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and one oxygen. The reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used for the ring-opening of epoxides. Oh, right! It's a strong, non-nucleophilic base, often used in the epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially under thermal conditions.

So, the product's NMR data is given. Let me look at the 1H and 13C NMR.

Starting with the 1H NMR:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, likely a methyl group attached to something deshielded but not splitting because of symmetry.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet, maybe another methyl group. Wait, but why two singlets for methyl?
- Then, the aromatic region: δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Hmm, that looks like a set of doublets, maybe a para-substituted benzene with substituents that cause splitting.

Looking at the 13C NMR:
- δ 21.3 and 28.4 (each a singlet for 1C): These are probably the two methyl groups. 21 is typical for a CH3 adjacent to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. 28 could be a CH2 or a methyl attached to something else.
- The rest are aromatic carbons. Let's see, 126.9 and 127.1 are two carbons. 129.1 and 130.3 are others. Then, 141.5 and 144.1 are probably carbons attached to something, maybe oxygen. The 197.7 is a carbonyl, but wait, the product's formula is C11H12O. Wait, the starting material is C11H12O, and the product? Hmm, but the reaction is ring-opening. Wait, compound X is reacting with the base, which would typically open the epoxide ring. So, if X is an epoxide, and it's ring-opened, what would the product look like?

Wait, the product's NMR shows a carbonyl at 197.7. That's a high shift, maybe a ketone or a carbonyl group. But the molecular formula... Wait, if X is an epoxide (three-membered ring, two oxygen atoms?), no, no. Wait, the formula is C11H12O. So, X is an epoxide, which would have an oxygen in the ring. So, when the epoxide opens, perhaps it forms an alcohol or something else. Or maybe the ring-opening leads to an elimination.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR data of the product. The 1H NMR shows four aromatic protons, but wait, a benzene ring has six protons. So, if we have two sets of doublets, each integrating to 1H, 2H, etc., maybe it's a para-substituted styrene or something. Let me think: If a benzene ring has substituents that cause splitting, like a vinyl group attached. Wait, the 1H NMR has 1H (d), 2H (d), another 1H (d), and another 2H (d). So, maybe a 1,4-disubstituted benzene? Or perhaps the structure is such that there are two doublets from adjacent protons and two from another set.

Wait, considering the 1H NMR, let's think about possible splitting patterns. For example, if there's a substituent on the benzene that's causing a coupling. Let's say it's a trans coupling. Maybe a para-substituted benzene with a double bond adjacent to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic region comes from a styrene group. Styrene is vinyl benzene, so the protons on the double bond would show up around 6.5-7.5 ppm. In the 1H NMR, the 6.75 (d) and then 7.68 (d) could be the two protons on the double bond, each as doublets due to coupling with each other. Then, the 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) could be from a para-substituted benzene ring. Wait, that would be a total of six aromatic protons.

But in the 1H NMR, we have 1H + 2H + 1H + 2H = 6H. So that adds up. So perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with two substituents: a methyl group and a styryl group (vinyl) substituent.

Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR, there's a peak at 197.7, which is a carbonyl. Wait, that doesn't fit with a styrene. Unless it's an ester or a ketone. But the product is after the ring-opening. Hmm, maybe the ring-opening forms a carbonyl?

Wait, another angle: the reaction is ring-opening of an epoxide. When an epoxide ring opens with a base like 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, what happens? It typically leads to the formation of an alcohol, but under certain conditions, it can lead to elimination if there's a good leaving group. Alternatively, if the epoxide is part of a larger structure, the ring-opening could form a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the epoxide ring-opening leads to a diol, but in this case, the product's NMR doesn't show any OH protons. So maybe it's an elimination, forming a double bond, which would
