Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Let me take it step by step.

First, I remember that the problem involves stability constants, which are given. So, the setup is a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are for the complexes [Co(SCN)]^n+.

Wait, the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, wait, stability constants usually increase with the formation of more stable complexes. Oh wait, but here β4 is lower than β3. That's a bit confusing. So maybe the complexes have different structures or something. But perhaps that's a detail I can set aside for now.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I recall that the blue complex might be the [Co(SCN)₂]³+ or maybe another one. But wait, the problem refers to dithiocyanato, so that's two SCN⁻ ions attached. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)₂]ⁿ⁺. Let me think: the charge. Co(II) is +2. Each SCN⁻ is -1. So for [Co(SCN)₂]^(n+), n would be 2 - 2*(1) = 0? Wait, no. Wait, Co^2+ and each SCN⁻ is -1. So [Co(SCN)₂] would have a charge of 2+ - 2*(1-) = 0? That's neutral. But I'm not sure if that's correct. Or wait, maybe the complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n+ something)? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_1], [Co(SCN)_2], up to [Co(SCN)_4]. So each would form with varying numbers of SCN⁻.

Wait, but the stability constants: β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is the formation constant for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]²+? Because Co²+ +
