Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem is about heating a mixture of two salts, A and B, in an equimolar ratio. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated without air to 200°C, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes, and the weight changes in these tubes give us some clues about the gases.

The setup of the tubes: 

1. Tube №1 has anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can trap water vapor. So if the gas mixture contains water, it would be absorbed here, increasing the weight of tube №1.

2. Tube №2 is filled with a Ca(OH)2 solution. Calcium hydroxide is used to absorb carbon dioxide. If CO2 is present, it will react with Ca(OH)2, forming CaCO3 and water. But since the weight of tube №2 didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture. Or maybe it was all absorbed? Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the weight of tube №2 hasn't changed. Hmm.

3. Tube №3 has red-hot copper. I think that when gases pass through hot copper, certain reactions might occur. For example, carbon monoxide (CO) can react with copper(II) oxide to form CO2 and copper. So maybe the gas has CO in it, which is oxidized to CO2.

The results are:

- Tube №1's weight increased by 3.60 grams. That probably means the gas had water vapor, which was absorbed here. So the mass of water is 3.60 g. Let me check: the molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So moles of H2O = 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

- Tube №3's weight increased by 0.80 grams. Since CuO is formed, that suggests that CO was present. The reaction of CO with CuO at high temperature would produce CO2 and Cu. The moles of CuO formed would be 0.80 g / (80 g/mol) = 0.01 mol. But wait, what's the relation between CO and CuO in this reaction?

The reaction is: 2CO + CuO → CO2 + Cu. So for every 2 moles of CO, 1 mole of CuO is produced. So moles of CO would be 2 * moles of CuO. So 2 * 0.01 = 0.02 mol CO.

Wait, but the mass increase in tube №3 is due to the oxygen from CO reacting with Cu. Let me think again. Let's model it. The mass increase in tube 3 is the mass of CuO formed. The CuO comes from the reaction between CO and CuO? Wait no, wait. When CO passes through hot Cu, I think the reaction is:

CO + Cu → CO2 +
