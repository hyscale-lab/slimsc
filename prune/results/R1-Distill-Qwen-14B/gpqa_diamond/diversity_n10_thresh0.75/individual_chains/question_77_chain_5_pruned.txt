Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes and it's a pericyclic reaction. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions, and I need to pick the major products from the options.

First, let's tackle part A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Wait, let me draw that structure. So, benzene ring attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a methyl group. Then, the but-2-en-1-yl part is a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at C2. So the structure would be: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Or wait, maybe the but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but for 1-yl, the substituent is at position 1. So the substituent is attached to the first carbon. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- group, but wait, no. Wait, 1-yl is when the substituent is on carbon 1. So, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. For but-2-en-1-yl, the substituent is on carbon 1, and the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's actually but-1-en-3-yl? No, perhaps I should number differently. Wait, no. Let's see: the butenyl group is four carbons. So 1-yl means the substituent is on carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's but-1-en-1-yl, I
