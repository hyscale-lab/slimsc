Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again and figure out what's going on.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group and some branching in the carbon chain. Each option is a different structure, so I need to analyze the spectroscopic data to pick the right one.

First, let me look at the FTIR data. The broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of O-H groups, which fits with a carboxylic acid since they have broad stretching due to hydrogen bonding. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is typical of a carboxylic acid or an ester. Since the options all have a COOH group, that makes sense.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR data. The key points are that there are several signals, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds in the molecule. That means whatever splitting we see is due to other factors like neighboring protons on adjacent carbons.

The NMR has two specific types of signals mentioned:

1. A doublet of triplets of quartets.
2. A doublet of triplets of triplets.

Hmm. Let's think about how splitting works in NMR. Each split occurs because of neighboring (adjacent) protons. The number of peaks in a multiplet tells us how many neighboring groups of Hs there are.

A doublet means each proton is next to one set of equivalent protons. A triplet means two adjacent sets, and so on.

So the first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Breaking that down: each level of splitting adds another factor. So starting from a quartet (split by four equivalent protons), each quartet is split into a triplet (by something else), and each triplet is split into a doublet.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as each split coming from different adjacent groups. Let me think about a structure where a CH group is connected to two different sets of neighboring CH2 groups or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons are on a carbon that's adjacent to two different types of environments. For example, if a CH is connected to two CH2 groups, each with different numbers of neighboring Hs.

Wait, another approach: maybe the splitting is due to vicinal coupling (J coupling) from adjacent carbons. Let's consider the structure of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So this would be like a structure where there are two CH groups, each attached to ethyl groups. So the structure is:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

Wait, so maybe the CH groups are each attached to two ethyl groups, and also connected to a CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps the central CH2 group is connected to two CHs, each of which is attached to ethyl groups.

Alternatively, let me draw each structure:

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

So that would be:

CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH

So this is a 4-carbon chain, with the middle two carbons each bearing a methyl group and a hydrogen. The end is a COOH group.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

So similar to D, but instead of methyl groups (CH3), it's ethyl (C2H5) on the middle carbons.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

That's:

CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH

So here, the first carbon is CH3, then two CH groups each with a methyl, then a CH2 connected to COOH.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

So:

CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH

Hmm. Now, the NMR has a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a more complex multiplet. Let's think about how the splitting would occur for different groups.

If a proton is on a carbon that's adjacent to two different sets of protons, each set having a certain number of Hs, the splitting can get complex. For example, if a
