Alright, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, okay, so we have two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The question is about determining which partial wave isn't allowed based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

First, I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle for identical particles like nucleons (since they're fermions) requires that the total wavefunction be antisymmetric under exchange. So, the isospin, angular momentum, and spin must combine in a way that the overall wavefunction is antisymmetric.

The given equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, but the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, substituting that in: 0 = S + L + 1 (mod 2). That simplifies to S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So S and L must be such that their sum is odd. That means either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L even.

Now, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. I think parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the initial parity and the final parity must match if parity is conserved. But I'm not entirely sure about the details here.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 would imply S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L is S in spectroscopic notation? Wait, no. Wait, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So 1S0: S=0 (because 2S+1=1 → S=0), L is 'S' which in spectroscopic notation means L=0. J is 0 because J is the total angular momentum, so J = L + S = 0 + 0 = 0. So the initial state is a scalar (J=0) with L=0, S=0.

So the initial parity is (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1. Because parity is (-1)^L for orbital angular momentum.

Now, the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the final state must be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of X. Because the parity is multiplicative over independent systems. So parity_final = parity_NN * parity_X.

Wait, but parity conservation requires that the initial and
