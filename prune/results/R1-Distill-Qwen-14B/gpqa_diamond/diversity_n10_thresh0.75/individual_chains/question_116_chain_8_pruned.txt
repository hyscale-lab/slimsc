Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

First, I'll read the question carefully. The problem involves several reactions starting from Compound A, then forming B, C, and finally D. The goal is to identify compound D from the given options.

Let me break down each part.

Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm. I remember that NMR signals tell us about the environment of the protons. The triplet and quartet suggest some coupling between adjacent protons. 

Looking at the integration, 6H and 4H. Maybe it's a structure with two sets of equivalent protons. For example, a di-substituted alkane. Wait, 6H could be two equivalent CH2 groups, each with 3H, but wait, 3H per group times two would be 6H. Or maybe it's something like two methyl groups attached to a central structure that has another group. 

Another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is often indicative of a methyl group adjacent to another group. Like, maybe in an ethyl group. Because a triplet in ethyl groups is common. Let me think: an ethyl group next to another CH2 group. 

Wait, the triplet (6H) might be two equivalent methyl groups. Like, a diethyl group? Or perhaps two CH2CH3 groups. But wait, if each CH2CH3 has 3H, two of them would give 6H. But the quartet is for 4H. So the quartet might be a CH2 attached to something else. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether structure. But diethyl ether would have different NMR signals. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That's a lot. Maybe it's two methyl groups attached to a CH2 group. For example, CH(CH2CH3)2. Because each CH2CH3 would be a triplet, and there are two of them. But wait, no, the methyl groups in such a structure would be split into a triplet because they're adjacent to the CH2. So if the CH2CH3 groups are
