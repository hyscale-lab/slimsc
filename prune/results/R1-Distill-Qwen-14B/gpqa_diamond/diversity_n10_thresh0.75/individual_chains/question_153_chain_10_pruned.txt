Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reactants and products for these Michael addition reactions. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the Michael reaction is all about.

From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate. This reaction typically involves a conjugated system, like an enone or enoate, and a nucleophile, often an enolate itself.

Looking at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, which is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's an enolate source. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor.

So, the Michael donor (dimethyl malonate) will attack the beta position of the acceptor. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait no, actually, when it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but where the substituents on the double bond are. Oh wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be more like the double bond between carbons 2 and 3, with groups on each side. So, the structure is CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on the third carbonâ€”wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's better to draw it out.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure: CH2-C(O)OCH2-CH2-p-tolyl? No, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is at the end. Wait, the correct structure is probably CH2=CH-CO-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't fit the naming. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-configuration, so the substituents on either side of the double bond are different. For 3-(p-tolyl) acrylate, the acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH2-p-tolyl? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

So, when the enolate of dimethyl malonate attacks the beta position of the acrylate,
