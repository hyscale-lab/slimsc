Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Michael addition problem. I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond and creating an enolate intermediate.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to determine what the major products are for each and match them to the options given.

Let's take it step by step.

Starting with Reaction A:
Reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH. NaOEt is a strong base, probably deprotonating the malonate to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.

Dimethyl malonate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Its structure is O=C-(CH2COOEt)₂. When deprotonated, the enolate would form on the central carbon, making it a strong nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH₂=CH-C(O)OEt, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)COOEt? Wait no, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Or perhaps the substituent is on the double bond. Let me think. Acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. Oh wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? No, wait, the numbering might be such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, so 3 would be the next carbon. Hmm, perhaps it's more like CH₂=C(p-tolyl)COOEt? No, wait, the
