Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through each part carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and the problem gives an equation relating isospin (T), spin (S), and angular momentum (L) of the final NN state: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final state has T(NN) = 0, so I can use that to find out something about the spin and angular momentum of the NN.

The question asks which partial wave is not permitted, and the options are A to D, each involving a different transition and a particle (p, s, f, etc.) with specific quantum numbers.

First, I should remember that in nuclear physics, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), where S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So for the initial state, it's 1S0. Let me parse that. The 1 in 1S0 must be the 2S+1 part. Oh wait, wait. Let me think: 2S+1 is the term symbol for spin multiplicity. So 1S0 would mean that 2S+1 = 1, so S=0. Because 2(0)+1=1. So S=0. L is denoted by the letter: S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, F is 3, etc. So 1S0: S=0, L=0 (since it's S state), and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital L=0, and J=0.

So the initial NN is in a state with S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So X could be a pion, I suppose. The parity of a system is important here, especially because the problem mentions conservation of parity.

Parity conservation comes into play, so the overall parity of the initial and final states should match. The initial parity is the parity of the NN state. For a two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L, since each nucleon contributes +1 in parity? Wait, wait—wait, the parity of a two-body system is (-1)^L × something? No, more accurately, parity for a system is (-1)^L multiplied by the intrinsic parity of each particle. Wait, no, each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1. Because protons and neutrons have parity +1 each. So the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L, because each nucleon contributes +1, so the product is (+1)^2 × (-1)^L, which is (-1)^L. So the initial state has parity (-1)^0=1.

The particle X has parity -1. So when it's emitted, the final state consists of the NN system and X. The parity of the final state must equal the initial parity multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle. Wait, no. Wait, the initial parity is the parity of the NN system. After emission, the final configuration is NN and X. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN system and the parity of X. But wait, when a particle is emitted, the parity of the entire process is considered. So the parity conservation says that the initial parity (of the NN system) equals the final parity (NN after emission) multiplied by the parity of X. Because when you emit a particle, the system's parity is the product of the parity of the initial system and the parity of the emitted particle. Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait,
