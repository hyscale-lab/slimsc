Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory doesn't require regularization when dealing with high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? Oh right, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergencesâ€”like when calculations result in infinite values. These infinities can mess up the theory, so regularization is a way to make the math manageable by introducing a temporary cutoff or some other method, and then you remove it later with renormalization.

So which theories need regularization? I remember that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) does have issues with divergences, especially in loop diagrams. Like, the simple models without renormalization would give things like the electron having an infinite charge, which is obviously not physical. So QED requires regularization and then renormalization to deal with these divergences.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is similar, but since it's a non-abelian gauge theory, the behavior is a bit different. I think QCD actually works without needing a cutoff because of asymptotic freedom. Wait, wait, asymptotic freedom is when the coupling becomes weak at high energies. But does that mean it doesn't need regularization? Or does it still have divergences that need handling? Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. I think QCD still requires renormalization because of the divergent loop integrals, but perhaps the structure of the theory makes it easier or possible without an explicit cutoff. Or maybe because it's a non-abelian theory, the running of the coupling is different, but I'm not entirely sure about regularization here.

Superstring Theory... Oh, string theory is supposed to be a theory of quantum gravity, right? And I think it's supposed to be a background-independent theory. Now, what about regularization in string theory? Strings have a certain structure, and perhaps their perturbative expansions don't have the same kind of divergences as in QED or QCD. Or maybe they can be regularized in a different way, like through the use of conformal field theories or other string-specific methods. I remember that string theory deals with high energies in a different way, perhaps making regularization unnecessary because the theory is finite. Or wait, maybe because string theories have a sort of 'built-in' cutoff due to the string scale, so they don't need the same kind of ad hoc regularization as other quantum field theories. So in superstring theory, perhaps regularization isn't required because the theory is already free from divergences, or the divergences are handled in a different way.

Then there's option D, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell equations and the classical theory of electromagnetism. In classical theories, do we even have issues with divergences at high energies? Wait, in classical E&M, when you have point charges, you get issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. But when you go to quantum theories like QED, you have to deal with these things. But in the classical case, like Maxwell's theory, do you require regularization?
