Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics and approximations used in many-body calculations, specifically the impulse approximation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which four assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. The options are four statements, 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of these. Let me try to break down each assumption and see how they contribute to the impulse approximation.

First, what's the impulse approximation about? From what I remember, it's an approximation where the nucleons in a nucleus are treated as if they were free particles. So, interactions are considered as instantaneous, and the nucleus as a whole doesn't affect each nucleon beyond the fact that they're bound together. 

Now, looking at the assumptions:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   - This makes sense because if the interaction is with individual nucleons, you can treat each as a free particle. The current doesn't 'see' the other nucleons, so each is affected independently.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   - Transparent meaning that the interaction doesn't pass through other nucleons, right? So only the selected nucleon interacts, others don't. That would imply that the rest of the nucleus doesn't influence the interaction, so the nucleon behaves as if it's free.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   - Wait, non-relativistic quarks? I'm a bit confused here. Quarks are confined inside nucleons, and if they're non-relativistic, it might mean that they don't have high energies. But how does that affect the approximation? Maybe if the internal structure (quarks) isn't moving too fast, the nucleon's motion isn't affected by their dynamics. So perhaps this assumption simplifies the treatment by allowing us to treat the nucleon as a point particle without considering internal motions. But I'm not entirely sure how this ties into the impulse approximation.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   - Oh right, if the nucleon isn't experiencing binding forces during the interaction, that means we're ignoring the residual interactions or the fact that it's part of a nucleus. So it's treated as if it's free, hence the impulse approximation, which treats each nucleon as a free particle.

Now, the question is which combination of these assumptions leads to the impulse approximation. Let's match each assumption to what the impulse approximation entails.

Impulse approximation:
- Treats each nucleon as a free particle.
- The interaction is treated as an external force applied to the nucleon, and the rest of the nucleus is considered as an inert medium.
- So, the other nucleons don't affect the interaction (nucleus is transparent except for the target nucleon), and the binding forces are neglected during the interaction.

So, the relevant assumptions should include treating individual nucleons (1), the nucleus being transparent except the selected one (2), and the selected nucleon not experiencing binding forces (4). What about assumption 3?

Assumption 3 is about the quarks being non-relativistic. I think that might be more related to the internal structure of the nucleon and perhaps the validity of using certain approximations for the nucleon's behavior. But does it directly contribute to the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is more about the interaction with the nucleon as a whole, not about the internal quark dynamics. So maybe assumption 3 isn't directly required for the impulse approximation but affects whether the individual nucleon can be treated as a simple entity.

Wait, but the question says which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. So perhaps all four are needed, but I don't think so. Let me reevaluate.

The impulse approximation is a part of the "single nucleon approximation" where each nucleon is considered independently, and their interactions are treated as if the other nucleons are not influencing the process. So the nucleus is transparent except for the interacting nucleon. The interaction is treated as an impulse, so the
