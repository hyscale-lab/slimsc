Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different structures, and I need to figure out which one matches the given spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in FTIR often indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the peak is very broad, it's likely a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are usually very broad and strong. Also, the peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is a strong absorption, which could correspond to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. But since we also have the broad O-H peak, that suggests it's a carboxylic acid because they have both a carbonyl and an O-H group. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group, -COOH.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says that several peaks were observed, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. The absence of such signals suggests that the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, or at least no vinyl protons because maybe the double bond is somewhere else or not present. But wait, all the options have branching and maybe some isopropyl groups, so I don't think any of them have a double bond. So that part is probably just telling us there's no alkene in the structure.

In the NMR, there are two specific signals mentioned. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's break it down.

First, a doublet of triplets of quartets. That means the proton in question is coupled with multiple sets of neighboring protons. Let me think: each splitting indicates coupling with a certain number of neighboring Hs.

A quartet would be four peaks, which comes from coupling with three equivalent protons. So if a proton is next to a CH2 group, it would split into a triplet. But wait, quartet is n+1, so if you have three equivalent protons, you get a quartet.

Wait, but this is a doublet of triplets of quartets. So that implies that the proton is split by three different sets of neighboring Hs. Let me think: the first split is a doublet, which suggests coupling with one adjacent proton. Then each of those is split into triplets, so another set of two adjacent Hs? Wait, no. Because each coupling adds a split. So each time you have a coupling, you add a split. So the order is important.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is a result of three different coupling partners. For example, a proton that has three different neighboring groups, each with a different number of Hs.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about each splitting step. Let's take the first signal: a doublet of triplets of quartets. So the splitting occurs in three stages. First, it's a doublet—so splits into two because of one neighboring proton. Then, each of those splits into triplets—so each peak is split by two neighboring protons (since triplet is n+1, where n=2). Then each of those splits into quartets, which would come from coupling with three protons (n+1=4, so n=3).

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the splitting is due to multiple coupling partners. For example, a proton that is next to three different sets of Hs. Let's say the proton is adjacent to a CH (which would lead to a doublet), then a CH2 (triplet), and another CH (
