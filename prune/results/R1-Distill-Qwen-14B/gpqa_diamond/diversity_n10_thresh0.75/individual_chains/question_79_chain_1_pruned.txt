Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given. The question is to identify what Compound X was, with four options provided.

Hmm, wait, the reaction conditions. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane... Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Oh wait, no, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides from dienes, but wait, wait, maybe it's for ring-opening epoxides? No, wait, actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (sometimes called DABCO) is often used as a catalyst in the epoxidation of alkenes, particularly in the Prilezhaev or other epoxidation reactions. Wait, no, Prilezhaev uses H2O2 and acid. Oh right, Sharpless epoxidation is with a titanium-based catalyst, but maybe DABCO is used in other contexts.

Alternatively, DABCO is used as a base in some reactions. Or perhaps as a solvent? Wait, no, I think it's a reagent used in the epoxidation of alkenes. Because when you have an alkene, DABCO can be used with peracids to form epoxides. But wait, peracids would be the typical way. Alternatively, maybe another reaction—like the epoxide ring opening?

Wait, but the product here is giving NMR data. Let's look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, singlets for two CH3 groups. One at 2.28 and another at 2.31. That suggests two methyl groups attached to
