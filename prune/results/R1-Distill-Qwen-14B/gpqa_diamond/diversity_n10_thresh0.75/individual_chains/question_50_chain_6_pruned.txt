Okay, so I've got this question about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says my colleague has a note with some terms: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. They're trying to estimate the size using these constants and ratios. The diagram is a Feynman diagram, and the question is about how many loops the diagram has.

I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order in perturbation theory. Like, each loop typically contributes a certain factor. Oh right, the formula for the amplitude of a loop diagram often involves a term like (loop factor)^(number of loops), and loop factors often involve factors like (1/(4π)^{something}) or similar.

Wait, let me think about the general structure. For each loop, the integral usually has a factor of (something like 1/(4π)^2) multiplied by some other terms. So the number of loops would influence how many times these factors come into play.

Looking at the expression given: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let's break this down. The denominator is (4π)^6. So 4pi to the power of 6. Since each loop contributes a 1/(4π)^2 factor, the number of loops would relate to the exponent in the denominator.

Wait, let me clarify. Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (1/(4π)^2) when you do dimensional regularization or something like that. Because when you compute loop integrals in 4 dimensions, each loop gives a 1/(16π²) factor, which is (1/(4π)^2) because 4π times 4π is 16π². So each loop brings a 1/(4π)^2 term.

So if the denominator is (4π)^6, that would be (4π)^2^3, right? Because (4π)^6 = ((4π)^2)^3. So that would imply three loops. Because each loop contributes (4π)^2 in the denominator.

Wait, but wait: the term is 1/(
