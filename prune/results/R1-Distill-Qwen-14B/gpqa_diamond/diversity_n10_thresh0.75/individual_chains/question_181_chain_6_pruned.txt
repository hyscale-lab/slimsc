Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let me think through what I know. The question is about the ratio of flux in two specific energy bands, 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV, after the pp-III branch stops suddenly in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. 

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main source of energy in the Sun. There are different branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the 3He generated in the pp-I branch combining with protons further up. But if the pp-III branch stops, that affects the production of certain particles. 

Neutrinos are produced in various reactions. The main ones are the pp chain and the CNO cycle. Oh, but the pp chain is the dominant one in the Sun. So if the pp-III stops, which part of the neutrino production is affected?

I think the pp chain contributes to neutrinos through several reactions. The main ones are the pep (proton-electron-proton) reaction and the dominant pp chain, which produces 7Be and then 7Be decays to 7Li via emitting a neutrino. Wait, wait. The dominant neutrino production in the Sun is the pp-I branch, which leads to the production of 7Be. The 7Be captures a proton to form 8B, which then decays, emitting a neutrino. The pp-III branch might produce more 3He, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects neutrinos.

Wait, if the pp-III stops, the production of 3He would stop. But 3He is involved in other processes, like the triple-alpha process in later stages of a star's life, but in the Sun, maybe it's more about how it affects the overall fusion rates. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a minor contributor compared to the dominant ones. 

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch stops. So what neutrinos are affected? The main neutrinos from the Sun are the electron neutrinos, and the main production is from the decay of 8B, which comes from the pp chain. So if the pp-III branch stops, but the rest continues, would that affect the total
