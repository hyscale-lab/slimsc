Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star with the same radius as the Sun. So R_star is same as Sun's radius, which I think is about 7e5 km or 1 solar radius. But I might not need the exact value since it's a ratio.

Half of the star's hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the star's surface is covered by spots. Oh wait, no—the question says one hemisphere is covered, so maybe each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. But wait, the filling factor is 20%, so perhaps each spot covers 20% of the hemisphere? Or maybe the total area of spots is 20% of the star's surface. Hmm, not sure yet, but let's keep that in mind.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are cooler because they're dark, right? The temperature difference is 1000 K. So the spots are at 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K, I guess.

The situation is that when the star rotates, only one hemisphere has spots, so we see brightness variations as the spots come into view and then are hidden again. This kind of looks like a planet transiting the star, causing dips in brightness. The question is, if the star didn't have spots, what radius planet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do?

So the key is to find the ratio R_planet / R_star such that when the planet transits, the dip in brightness is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

I remember that the change in brightness (the transit depth) is given by (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio. So if the planet causes a dip of ΔF, then ΔF = (R_p / R_s)^2.

But in this case, the dip is caused by spots. So I need to calculate the equivalent dip caused by the spots. How would that work?

The star's brightness is affected by the spots. When the spots are facing us (the hemisphere), the brightness is lower because spots are cooler
