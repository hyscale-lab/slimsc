Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a star similar to the Sun, right? The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Oh wait, filling factor—oh yeah, that's the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So 20% means the spots take up 0.2 of the hemisphere's surface area.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler, having a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots must be at 5000K, right? Because 6000 minus 1000 is 5000.

Now, the setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective. So when a spot is facing us, it's blocking some light, causing a dip in brightness. But the question is about how this situation can mimic an exoplanet transit. They want to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Wait, but the question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet size would give the same amplitude in the light curve. So I think we need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots and then find the planet size that would cause the same change.

First, let me break down the problem. The star's brightness variation due to the spots is what's being measured. But when a planet transits the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip proportional to the area blocked. So the amplitude of the dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star.

But wait, the star's spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view. Since it's a hemisphere, I think the maximum coverage would be when the spots are fully facing us. But let's think about how that affects the overall brightness.

The star's total luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, the luminosity decreases. The spots have a lower temperature, so each spot emits less. The change in flux is the difference between the star's flux and the
