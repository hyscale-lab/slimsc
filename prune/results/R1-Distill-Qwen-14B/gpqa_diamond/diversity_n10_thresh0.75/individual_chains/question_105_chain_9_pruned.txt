Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun, radius same as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The setup is that when the star rotates, these spots come into view, causing brightness variations. But the interesting part is that this could mimic an exoplanet transit, causing a dip in brightness. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness change as the star with spots.

Wait, wait. The problem says that if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet size would give the same amplitude? So they're comparing the scenario where the brightness variation is due to a planet transit versus this spot scenario.

Hmm. I think I need to find the ratio R_planet / R_star that would cause the same dip in brightness as the spot-induced variation.

First, let me think about how the star's brightness changes with the spots. The star emits light based on its temperature. Spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, the total brightness decreases.

The star's total luminosity when unspotted is L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. But when spots are present, the luminosity decreases.

Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. Here, the filling factor is 20% (0.2) on one hemisphere. But wait, one hemisphere has spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR² / 2) )? Wait, the star is a sphere, so each hemisphere is 2πR². So one hemisphere has 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² area covered. But wait, the total surface area of the star is 4πR². So spots cover 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 10% of the total surface.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%". So the filling factor is 0.2 on that hemisphere, meaning 20% of that hemisphere is covered. Each hemisphere is 2πR². So spots take up 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total area of spots is 0.4πR².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4πR²) / (4πR²) )= 0.1, or 10%.

But wait, the problem says the spots have a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spot temperature is 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

So the star's total luminosity varies as it rotates, because different spots come into view. The maximum and minimum brightness would depend on how much of the spots are visible. But since only one hemisphere is spotted, the other hemisphere is normal.

Wait, the star is observed from Earth, and as it rotates, the spots come into view. When the spot hemisphere is facing us, the brightness is lower. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) is facing us, brightness is higher, but wait, wait. No, because the star's overall brightness is an average of all the areas visible.

Wait, maybe I should model the variation in brightness due to the spots. Since it's a rotational modulation, the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. The amplitude of this variation would be the difference between when the spots are fully visible and when they're not.

Wait, but the star's brightness without spots would be L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. When spots are present, the brightness is L' = L - (area of spots) * σ (T_spot)^4 + (area of spots) * σ (Teff)^4? No, wait. The spots are cooler than the rest of the star. So the total luminosity when the spots are visible would be less than when they are not.

Wait, actually, the star's brightness is the sum of all the flux from its surface. The regions without spots emit at Teff, and the spots emit at T_spot.

So the luminosity when the spots are facing us is L_min = L_unspotted + (fraction of spots) * (L_spot per area) * (area). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of it as the average flux.

Wait, let me think about it this way. The star's total flux (without spots) is F = σ Teff^4. The spots have a lower flux, F_spot = σ (Teff - delta_T)^4. The filling factor is f = 0.2 for one hemisphere.

But wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So in the hemisphere we are viewing, 20% is spots, and 80% is normal. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the observed flux from that hemisphere is (0.2 * F_spot) + (0.8 * F_normal). The other hemisphere is completely normal, so it contributes F_normal.

Wait, no. The total flux from the star when the spot hemisphere is facing us is the sum of the flux from the spot hemisphere and the flux from the other hemisphere.

The spot hemisphere's flux is (0.2 * F_spot) + (0.8 * F_normal) multiplied by the area of the hemisphere. The other hemisphere's flux is F_normal multiplied by its area.

Wait, but the area of each hemisphere is the same. So the total flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is:

F_total = (0.2 * F_spot + 0.8 * F_normal) * (hemisphere area) + F_normal * (hemisphere area)

Wait, but the hemisphere area is 2πR², but since the star is a sphere, the total area is 4πR². So each hemisphere is 2πR².

So when the spot hemisphere is visible (facing us), the flux is:

F_spotty = (0.2 * F_spot + 0.8 * F_normal) * (2πR²) + F_normal * (2πR²) ?

Wait, no. No, because when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the entire spot hemisphere is visible. So the flux from that hemisphere is (0.2 * F
