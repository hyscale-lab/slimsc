Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, it's about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it can form complexes with metal ions. The question gives me a concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and some formation constant, and I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions. Let's think step by step.

First, the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex itself is 0.02 M. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think the formation constant relates the concentration of the complex to the product of the concentrations of the ions involved.

Wait, the complex is Ca-EDTA, so I suppose it's a 1:1 complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The formation constant, K, for this reaction would be K = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Oh right, because K is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

But in this problem, we're given that the solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I'm assuming that the EDTA is in excess, or maybe that all the calcium is in the complex. Wait, but the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions. So we're going to need to find [Ca²+].

Since the formation constant is quite large (5e10), that suggests that the complex is very stable. So the concentration of the free Ca²+ ions should be very low because almost all the calcium is tied up in the complex.

Let me think about the expression again. K = [Complex]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Since K is large, the denominator must be small, meaning either [Ca²+] or [EDTA^4−] is small. But in a solution where the complex is formed, both Ca²+ and EDTA are present in some form.

Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, that's the concentration of the complex. So initially, without any dissociation, the complex is 0.02 M. But
