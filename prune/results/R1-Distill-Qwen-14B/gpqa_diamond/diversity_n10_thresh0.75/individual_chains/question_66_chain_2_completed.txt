Okay, so I have this physics question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are 1 to 4, with four choices in the options.

First, I need to recall what each symmetry is and whether SMEFT requires them. Let me think about each symmetry.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: I know that the Standard Model (SM) and all its extensions, including SMEFT, must respect Lorentz symmetry. Because without that, the theory wouldn't make sense in a relativistic framework. So SMEFT operators should all be Lorentz invariant. So symmetry 1 is definitely required.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a broader symmetry? Since SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's built in a way that respects the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Poincare symmetry because it includes special relativity. So SMEFT must also respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, is Poincare automatically satisfied if Lorentz is? Because Poincare includes things like momentum conservation due to translation invariance. So if all operators transform correctly under Lorentz, they should also be translationally invariant, hence respecting Poincare. So symmetry 2 is also required.

Wait, wait. So the SMEFT operators are built as Lorentz-invariant operators. Since all such operators are Poincare-invariant as well because they include translations. So both 1 and 2 are required. So options that include both 1 and 2 would be correct. So looking at the options: option A is 1,2. Option C is 1,2,4. So which is it?

Wait, but I need to think about whether all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. I think yes, because the effective theory is constructed under the same principles as the SM, which includes Poincare. So 2 must be respected.

3. CP symmetry: Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry on its own because of things like the CKM matrix leading to CP violation. So SMEFT can include operators that break CP if the SM itself does. But wait, does SMEFT require all operators to respect a particular symmetry? Or is it that the theory as a whole respects certain symmetries? Wait, the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators.

Wait, SMEFT includes all possible operators, so some operators might break specific symmetries. For example, operators that violate CP would be allowed if they are present. But wait, no. Because in the SMEFT, the operators are organized into terms with higher dimensions, but they are constructed to respect certain symmetries. Wait, maybe not. Because the SMEFT is a framework that allows for all possible interactions as long as they are consistent with the SM symmetries. So SM symmetries include things like gauge symmetry, but not necessarily CP. Wait, no, the SM doesn't have a global symmetry like CP, so SMEFT operators can violate CP. So symmetry 3 isn't necessarily respected by all operators.

Wait, but this is confusing. I need to think again. The question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT? So if the symmetry is a part of the underlying theory, then the operators must respect it. But if the symmetry is not part of the underlying theory, operators can violate it. So SMEFT is based on the SM, which doesn't have CP symmetry. So operators in SMEFT could include terms that break CP. So symmetry 3 doesn't have to be respected by all operators.

4. CPT symmetry: Now, the SM is CPT symmetric. Wait, no, is the SM CPT symmetric? I think all Lorentz-invariant theories are CPT symmetric. Because in quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must have a CPT symmetry. Because the combination of C, P, and T transformations must leave the theory invariant. So if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry. So in SMEFT, since all operators must be Lorentz-invariant, they must also respect CPT symmetry. So symmetry 4 is required.

So putting it all together:

Which symmetries must be respected by all operators?

1. Lorentz Symmetry - yes.

2. Poincare - yes, because it's broader but in the same framework.

Wait, but wait: Poincare is already included in Lorentz? Or is it separate? Poincare includes translations, so it's a bigger symmetry. So if a theory is Poincare-invariant, it's automatically Lorentz-invariant. But the converse may not hold. But in SMEFT, the operators are Lorentz-invariant, but do they automatically respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, which imply momentum conservation. But SMEFT operators are local, so perhaps they are Poincare-invariant. Because all the operators are written in a way that respects local symmetries, including translation invariance. So yes, Poincare symmetry is required.

So 1 and 2 are both required.

Wait, but the question is which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if Poincare is a larger symmetry, and the operators are Lorentz-invariant, which is a subset of Poincare, then all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So 1 and 2 are both correct.

Symmetry 3 (CP) doesn't have to be respected because SMEFT allows for operators that break CP; the SM itself doesn't respect it. So 3 is not required.

Symmetry 4 (CPT) must be respected because SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant and CPT is required for Lorentz-invariant theories. So 4 is correct.

So, which options include 1, 2, and 4?

Looking at the options:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1, 2, and 4.

Wait, but wait again. Does SMEFT require all operators to respect Poincare symmetry? Because Poincare includes not just Lorentz but also translation invariance. Since the SMEFT is a field theory, all operators are local, so translation invariance holds. So yes, all operators must be Poincare-invariant.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2,4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare is a bigger symmetry than Lorentz. So if operators are Poincare-invariant, they are automatically Lorentz-invariant, and vice versa? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, no. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if a theory is Poincare-invariant, it's also Lorentz-invariant. But a theory can be Lorentz-invariant without being Poincare-invariant only if it doesn't respect translations. But in a field theory, all interactions are local, so translation invariance is built-in. So in a field theory like SMEFT, operators are automatically Poincare-invariant because they're local and Lorentz-invariant. So if the operators are Lorentz and Poincare invariant, that's correct.

So 1 and 2 are both required, as well as 4. So the correct option is C: 1,2,4.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is a relativistic effective field theory, meaning all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. This is fundamental to ensuring the theory is consistent with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since SMEFT is a field theory, all operators are local and translationally invariant, making Poincaré symmetry automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry is respected. Thus, Poincaré symmetry must also be respected by all operators.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The Standard Model (SM) itself does not respect CP symmetry (e.g., due to CP-violating effects in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT allows operators that may violate CP symmetry. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: In quantum field theory, any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it automatically respects CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not necessarily respected by all operators.

**Correct Option**: C) 1, 2, 4.

Answer: C
