Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. The key points given are the brightness limits for each spectrograph. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitudes, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the star must be bright enough (apparent V mag less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES) to be detected by both.

Wait, no, actually, wait. Because the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. Wait, wait, in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17 (i.e., magnitude less than 17), it's observable by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, it's brighter than 16 mag, so apparent magnitude less than 16.

But wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. That means the star's apparent V magnitude must satisfy both conditions. So, the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (since ESPRESSO can detect stars up to 17), but also <=16 (since HIRES can only go up to 16). So the combined condition is apparent V mag <=16. Because if a star is brighter than 16 (apparent mag <=16), then it's observable by both. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, but HIRES can't go beyond 16, so the stricter condition is 16.

Wait, but wait: the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, apparent V mag <=17. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 can be observed, so apparent V mag <=16. So, a star must have apparent V mag <=16 to be detectable by both, because if it's above 16, HIRES can't see it, even if ESPRESSO can.

So, the first thing I need to do is find each star's apparent V magnitude and see if
