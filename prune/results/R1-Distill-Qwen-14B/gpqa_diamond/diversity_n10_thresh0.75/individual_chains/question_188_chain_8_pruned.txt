Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that a rhombohedral crystal system has all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, which I think refers to the length 'a' of the edges of the unit cell. 

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember there's a formula for interplanar distances in crystals. Oh yeah, the general formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cosα + kl cosβ + lh cosγ) ) )

Wait, wait. Wait, is that right? Because in a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, but here the angles are different. Oh, but wait, rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c and the angles are all equal, so perhaps the formula can be adjusted.

Wait, the formula I think is:

d_{hkl} = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + kl cos α + lh cos α) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Because in a rhombohedral system, since all the
