Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember something about the photosphere and energy levels in LTE—oh right, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And I need to find which equation relates the temperatures T1 and T2 correctly.

Wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two energy states. Oh right, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g factors are the degeneracies, E levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Oh, 1.38 is close to k, Boltzmann's constant. Let me check: k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE is exactly k times 1 K. Interesting.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the ratio for star_1 (n1) over star_2 (n2) is 2. So n1/n2 = 2.

But wait, the energy levels—let me think. The specific energy level, I guess, is the higher energy level. So the excited state is higher than the ground state, perhaps. Oh wait, but the question says "twice as excited"—so maybe the number of atoms in a particular excited state is higher in star_1.

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let me think. The problem states that the energy difference between the considered levels is 1.38e-23 J, which is equal to k (since k is about 1.38e-23 J/K). So when T is in a certain relation, the exponent could matter.

Wait, the main idea is that the population ratio of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state (n_upper) to the lower state (n_lower) is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So n_upper/n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming same g factors for both levels.

Wait, but if the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio is n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Let me clarify.

Wait, the wording is: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for a given energy level, the population is twice as high in star_1. So if the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 > E1, then n2 (number in E2) is twice n1 (number in E1) for star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Let me define the excited state as the higher energy level. So in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2. So for star_1, n_upper1 / n_lower1 = ratio1, and for star_2, n_upper2 / n_lower2 = ratio2. And ratio1 is twice ratio2? Or ratio1 = 2 * ratio2?

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps n_upper1 = 2 * n_upper2? Or maybe n_upper1 / n_lower1 = 2 * (n_upper2 / n_lower2). I'm not entirely certain, but let's proceed.

So, the ratio for each star is:

ratio1 = n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly,

ratio2 = n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, ratio1 is twice ratio2. So:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2)

Multiplying both sides by -k:

ΔE/(T1) = -k ln(2) + ΔE/(T2)

Wait, wait. Let me re-express this step. Let me take ln of both sides.

ln( exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ) = ln( 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) )

Which simplifies to:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + ( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So, moving terms around:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because it's -1/(T1) + 1/(T2) = (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Hmm, let me see:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k * 1 K.

So,

(k * 1) / (k) ) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Simplify:

1 * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) = ln(2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2)= (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the correct equation is D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the observed population of iron atoms in specific energy levels. The Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels, given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,1}}}{n_{\text{lower,1}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper,2}}}{n_{\text{lower,2}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the population ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2, i.e.,

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1} - \frac{\Delta E}{kT_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \( \Delta E/k \):

\[
\Delta E/k \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = -\ln(2).
\]

Simplifying \( \frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} \) as \( \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\Delta E/k \cdot \frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1T_2} = -\ln(2).
\]

Given that \( \Delta E = k \cdot 1 \, \text{K} \) (since \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches option D, which states:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation is:

**Answer: D**
