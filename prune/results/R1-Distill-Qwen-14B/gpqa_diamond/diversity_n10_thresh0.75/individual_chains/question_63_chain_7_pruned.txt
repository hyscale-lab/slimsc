Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So the molecule is in the ground state for both modes. Now, a photon is absorbed, and the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, the next state after the fundamental state—so it's the first excited state. But I'm not sure if it's a rotation or vibration transition here.

The problem involves the quantum rotation-vibration model, which considers both rotation and vibration as quantized states. I think that in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are different from the rigid rotor because the bond length can change. But wait, in the quantum rotation-vibration model, do we consider the vibrational energy levels and rotational energy levels separately? Or is there some coupling?

Wait, I remember that in the diatomic molecule, the energy levels have two parts: the rotational part and the vibrational part. Each contributes to the total energy. The fundamental state would be the lowest rotational state (maybe J=0 or J=1 depending on the model) and the lowest vibrational state (n=0). So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, which transition gives the smallest energy increase? Because if it's the next state, it's the one with the least energy required.

Wait, the energy levels for vibration are quantized as (n + ½)ħω, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ħω. For rotation, the energy levels are (J (J+1) ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. The difference between J=0 and J=1 is (2*1)(ħ²/(2I)) ) = ħ²/(I), I think. But wait, for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which is ħ²/(2I). So the spacing between J and J+1 is B*(2J+2) – B*J(J+1) ? Wait no, need to compute E
