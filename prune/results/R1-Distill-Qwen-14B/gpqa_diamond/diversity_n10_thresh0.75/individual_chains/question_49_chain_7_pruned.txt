Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic reactions involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. The question has three different reactions that I need to complete, and then pick the right options from A to D.

Let me take it step by step.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A. 

Wait, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. I think the H+ and heat might be catalysts for some kind of cyclization or rearrangement. The 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. But-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol, maybe.

I recall that Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But wait, the Claisen typically starts with an allyl vinyl ether. Alternatively, the Cope rearrangement is for 1,5-dienes, but I don't see that here.

Wait, but in this reaction, perhaps the amine is acting as a nucleophile? The but-3-en-2-ol has a hydroxyl group on C2, so maybe it's protonated to form a good leaving group. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an enamine or undergoing some kind of condensation.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like a geminal diether with an amine. If I remove the two methoxy groups, it's just ethylamine with two oxygens attached. Hmm. Wait, but with H+ and heat, perhaps the methoxy groups are leaving. Or maybe the amine is undergoing some kind of reaction with the but-3-en-2-ol.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, but but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4,
