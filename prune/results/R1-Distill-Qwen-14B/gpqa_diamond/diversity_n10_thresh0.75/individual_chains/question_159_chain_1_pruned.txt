Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology, and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm, let's start breaking it down.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that in quasars, emission lines are common, and sometimes the broad emission lines can be broadened due to the high velocity of the emitting gas near the central black hole. But wait, how does that relate to the distance?

Oh right! There's something called the Lyman-alpha forest, which are absorption lines blueward of the Lyman-alpha emission line (which is around 121 nm). But wait, the peak here is at 790 nm. That's in the near-infrared, which is longer than optical. Wait, maybe the emission line is redshifted. So the rest wavelength is shorter, and the observed wavelength is longer because of the expansion of the universe.

Wait, what's the rest wavelength for some prominent emission lines? Let me think. Oh, Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm, and that's in the far UV. Hydrogen-alpha is about 656 nm, which is in the optical. So if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's longer than 656, so it's redshifted. So maybe the H-alpha line is at 790 nm. So the redshift z would be (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1.

Let me calculate that. Observed λ is 790 nm. Rest λ for H-alpha is 656.3 nm. So z = 790 / 656.3 -1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 656 is approximately 1.204, so z is about 0.204. So the redshift is about 0.2.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. The comoving distance is a way to measure distance in cosmology, and it depends on the expansion history of the universe. The parameters given are H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy density Ωde=0.7, and flat universe (so Ω
