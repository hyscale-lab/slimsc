Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Let's see. Hmm, I remember that entropy for a black hole is related to its area. Right, the formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B}, where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon. Oh right, angular size θ is the angle subtended by the event horizon as seen from Earth. So I can use θ to find the size of the event horizon.

The formula for angular size is θ (in radians) ≈ diameter / distance. So diameter D ≈ θ * d. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I should convert it to radians first.

Wait, the distance is d=10^10 parsecs. Oh, right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

The angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians. Since 1 degree is π/(180) radians, θ in radians is 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So the diameter D = θ * d = (1.745e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) = let's calculate that. 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 is approximately (1.745 * 3.086) e7. Let's compute 1.745 *3.086. Hmm, 1.7 *3 is about 5.1, 0.045*3 is 0.135, so total like 5.235. So 5.235e7 meters. Wait, that's 5.235e7 m, which is 5.235e4 kilometers, which is about 52.35 million kilometers. Hmm, but that's the diameter. So the radius is half of that, 2.617e7 meters.

Wait, actually, the event horizon radius R is given by R = 2 G M / c². Oh right, so the diameter would be 2 R, so 2*(2 G M / c²) = (4 G M)/(c^2). Alternatively, maybe I should compute the radius first.

Wait, but the angular size θ is approximately equal to the diameter divided by the distance, assuming θ is very small, which it is (1e-17 degrees is tiny). So θ ≈ D / d, so D = θ * d.

So D ≈ 1e-17 degrees converted to radians * distance in meters.

Wait, maybe my approximations are off, but let me proceed.

So D ≈ (1e-17 degrees) * (d in meters). Let me compute θ in radians accurately: θ = (1e-17 degrees) * (π radians / 180 degrees) = (1e-17) * (π/180) ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

So D = θ * d = (1.74533e-19) * (3.086e26 m) = 1.74533e-19 *3.086e26 = let me calculate that. 1.74533 *3.086 is about
