Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, let me think about what each part means.

The metric given is ds² equals 32 divided by (4 minus x² minus y²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So, in LaTeX, that's written as:

ds² = \frac{32}{4 - x² - y²} (dx² + dy²)

I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor tells us about the geometry of spacetime. But here, it's more of a 2-dimensional problem, I think. Because the metric is written in terms of dx and dy, which are two-dimensional coordinates. So maybe we're in 2D here.

Wait, a pseudosphere... Oh, right! A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Like a saddle shape. But in 2D, the pseudosphere would be a surface with hyperbolic geometry. The radius of curvature is r, which in this case is given as 2. So r=2.

The question is about finding the area of this pseudosphere. Hmm. I recall that the area of a sphere in 2D (which would be a circle) is 4πr². But a pseudosphere is different. Wait, but wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is a hyperbola, or more generally, a hyperbolic surface.

Wait, but the metric they've given me might be representing a 2D space with a specific curvature. Let me think about the form of the metric. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So, 4 is like r² where r is 2. So 4 = (2)^2. That makes sense because the radius is 2.

The metric looks similar to the metric of a hyperbolic space. Wait, hyperbolic space in 2D is usually written as ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 - (r²/a²))) dθ², but that's in polar coordinates. This metric is in Cartesian coordinates, I think.

Wait, perhaps this is the metric of a hyperbolic plane in Poincaré coordinates. The Poincaré disk model uses coordinates x and y, and the metric is something like ds² = (4/(a²(1 - (x² + y²)/a²))) (dx² + dy²). Oh, right, because the Poincaré disk has a curvature that depends on the parameter a, which is related to the radius of curvature.

In the Poincaré disk model, the curvature is -1/a². So if a is the radius of the disk, which for a pseudosphere might be related to the radius of curvature.

Wait, the radius of curvature for a hyperbolic surface is sometimes denoted as r, but in the Poincaré model, the parameter a is the radius of the disk. But when you have a hyperbolic plane, the curvature is negative, so the Gaussian curvature K is -1/a².

In this problem, the radius r is given as 2. So I think the Gaussian curvature K is related to r. For a pseudosphere, the Gaussian curvature is constant and negative. The radius of curvature is the reciprocal of the curvature magnitude. So if K = -1/(
