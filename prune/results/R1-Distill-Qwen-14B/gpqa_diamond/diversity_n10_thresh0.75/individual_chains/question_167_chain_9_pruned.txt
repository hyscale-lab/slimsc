Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, okay, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] divided by N. I remember that |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, right? Coherent states are Gaussian states, so when you combine them, you can get non-Gaussian states, especially when there's a phase difference involved.

The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Okay, so that's important because we need to construct the density matrix rho for |psi> correctly. 

The problem gives us phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. Let's plug those values in. So phi is -pi/4, which is 45 degrees below the x-axis? Wait, no, phi is the phase angle in the superposition. So cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, same as sin(pi/4) but wait, cos(-pi/4) is cos(pi/4) because cosine is even. Oh right, cos(-x) = cos(x), so cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. But wait, in the state, it's sin(phi) multiplied by |-alpha>, so let me compute that.

First, compute N. Let's find sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2phi would be -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi)*exp(-2 alpha²) is -1 * exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = -exp(-0.5). So exp(-0.5) is around 0.6065, but with a negative sign.

Wait, N is sqrt(1 + [sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)]). Plugging in the numbers: 1 + (-exp(-0.5)) => 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6275. Wait, but wait, N is a normalization factor, so it should be a real positive number. But wait, 1 + [something negative] could potentially be problematic if the value inside the sqrt becomes negative. Wait, let me compute 1 - exp(-0.5): exp(-0.5)≈0.6065, so 1-0.6065=0.3935, which is positive. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. So the normalization is about 0.6275.

So the state is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/N. Let's compute the coefficients:

cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.
sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So the state becomes (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Now, this is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. I remember that a coherent state is a Gaussian state, but combining them with a phase (like in a cat state) can lead to a non-Gaussian state.

The question is about the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy between the state |psi> and a reference Gaussian state. The formula given is del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], where rho is the state in question and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

But wait, relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho
