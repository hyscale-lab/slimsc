Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and how likely the orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer in to its star since it takes less time to orbit.

The stars have different masses, but the same radius. Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting because usually more massive stars are larger, but maybe Planet_1's star is a bit evolved or something elseâ€”no, wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe Planet_1's star is less evolved. But anyway, both stars have the same radius.

So, the question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, but since we're considering Earth-like planets, their radii are similar. Wait, but the planets' sizes would affect the transit depth, but the probability is about the chances of the planet's orbit being edge-on enough for the transit to occur.

Wait, the transit probability formula. I think the probability P is (R_p / a)^2, but that's for the depth. No, wait, that's the depth. The probability of the planet transiting is actually more about the alignment. The formula for the probability of a transit is (R*/a) * (1/(sqrt(1 - (R_p/a)^2))) ), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, another approach. The probability that a planet transits is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the orbital semi-major axis. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front. The area where this alignment is possible is related to the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, no, I think the transit probability is (R*/a), where R* is the radius of the star and
