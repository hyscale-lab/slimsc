Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So that's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. Ethynyl is C≡CH, right? So the structure is cyclohexane with a triple bond attached to a CH2 group maybe? Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So it's cyclohexane connected to a carbon with a triple bond to another carbon.

The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring, a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbaldehyde group. Let me try to visualize this. The main chain probably has a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is another cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a formyl group (carbaldehyde). Wait, no. Wait, the formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part is the main ring with a formyl group. Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group.

So, the substituent is a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is cyclohexane with a formyl group (CHO), and at position 1 (adjacent?), a CH(OH) group connected to a cyclohexyl.

Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. The main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so a cyclohexane with a CHO group. Then, in the 1 position of the cyclohexane ring (so adjacent to the CHO), there's a substituent: a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. That substituent is a CH(OH) attached to a cyclohexane.

So, substituent is CH(OH)-cyclohexane. So the target structure is a cyclohexane ring with a CHO group and a
