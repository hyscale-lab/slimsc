Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, it's a hydrocarbon with some double bonds and branching.

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element's standard state. For carbon, it's given as 1000 kJ/mol, which I think refers to breaking a C-C bond in graphite, maybe. But I'm not entirely sure.

The molecule is... let me count the carbons. Each (CH3)2 group is three carbons each, but wait, each has two CH3 groups attached to a central carbon. So that's (CH3)2C=CH-..., then another CH2, then CH(CH3), CH2, CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, maybe I should figure out the molecular formula first. Let me count each part:

- The first part is (CH3)2C=CH-. That's 2*(CH3) â†’ 2*1=2 CH3 groups attached to a C which is double-bonded to another CH group. So the C is connected to two CH3, one double bond (C=C), and another CH.

Wait, maybe the entire molecule is something like 2-methyl-1,3-pentadiene or something similar, but I'm not certain. Let's just count the atoms. Each (CH3)2C=CH- is a fragment. How many carbons? Each (CH3)2 is 2*3=6? No, wait, each (CH3) is one C and three Hs. So (CH3)2C is 3 carbons. Then a double bond to another CH, so that adds another carbon, making the first fragment 4 carbons (3 from (CH3)2C and one from the CH in the double bond? Wait, no, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-..., so the central C is double-bonded to another C which is connected to an H. So that part is four carbons: two CH3's, one C connected to the double
