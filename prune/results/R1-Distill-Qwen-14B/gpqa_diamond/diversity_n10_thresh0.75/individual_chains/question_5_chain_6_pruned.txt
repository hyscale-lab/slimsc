Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Hmm, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like a muon, the spin operator components (like S_x, S_y, S_z) are proportional to the Pauli matrices. But wait, in this case, the operator is P, not S, but maybe the structure is similar. The given components P_x, P_y, P_z are each 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

Let me write down what each component looks like. 

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1],[1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]

Wait, these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P is similar to the spin angular momentum operator, but scaled by ħ/2 instead of ħ/2 as in spin-1/2.

The eigenvector problem is for a general direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, which means its direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, in spherical coordinates, θ
