Okay, so I have this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method depends on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. 

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So if Planet_1's period is shorter, its orbit is smaller.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, but more massive stars are usually bigger, but here they have the same radius. That's interesting. So perhaps Planet_1's star has a higher mass but same radius, meaning maybe it's a subgiant or something? Not sure, but it might not affect the transit probability directly.

So the question is about the probability of a transit. The transit probability (P) is given by the formula: P ≈ (R_p / a) / (R_s / a) )... Wait, no, that's not right. I think the probability depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Wait, no, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the star's diameter. Because the planet has to pass across our line of sight, which depends on the star's apparent size. 

Wait, the transit probability is higher when the star is smaller because the planet is more likely to block our view. Also, the planet needs to have an orbital distance that allows the alignment for transit. But maybe the probability is proportional to R_p² / a², where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis. But wait, I might be mixing things up.

Another approach: The probability of a transit depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit relative to our line of sight. The formula I remember is P = (R_* + R_p)/a, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately the ratio (R_p / a) multiplied by (1 / (sin i)), where i is the inclination. But since we're considering the maximum possible probability, we can assume i is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1, so the probability is roughly (R_p / a) / (R_* / a) )? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for the probability is (R_p / R_*)² divided by something else... No, wait, let's think. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block, but considering the orbital distance. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's diameter. Wait, that makes sense. Because the planet has to pass through the star's disk. So the probability is (R_* / a) × something. Or actually, the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the star's radius (R_*) times something else. Wait, maybe it's the other way around.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on. Wait, no, the edge-on alignment is necessary for the transit, but the inclination is a factor. Since the RV method already detects the planet, the inclination is known or at least gives a lower mass. Wait, no, RV method gives a minimum mass because it depends on the inclination. But for transit probability, perhaps the probability is higher if the planet's orbit is near the plane of the sky relative to us. 

Wait, no, for randomly oriented orbits, the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits is about (R_*/a), where R_* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis. Wait, I think the formula is P = (R_* / (a * sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so P = R_* / a. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_*)² / (a / R_*), but I might be mixing up factors.

Wait, maybe a better way: The probability of transit is given by P = (R_*/a) × (R_p / R_*), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I remember that the probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_*/a) multiplied by something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the transit probability is P = (R_p / R_*)² / (a / R_*). No, that doesn't sound right. Let me think about units. R_p and R_* are in meters; a is in meters. So R_p/R_* is unitless. R_*/a is 1/(unitless), so 1/(something). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct formula for transit probability is P = (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / (a / R_* ))). So P = (R_p² R_*) / (R_*² a) ) → (R_p²) / ( R_* a ). But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, another approach. The transit probability is the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the sphere that the planet's orbit subtends. Or something like that. Wait, from Earth's perspective, the probability that the planet's path intersects our line of sight is the ratio of the star's diameter to the planet's orbital distance, squared? Hmm.

Wait, the transit probability is approximately (R_* / a)² multiplied by the solid angle factor. Or perhaps it's (R_* / a) multiplied by (R_p / R_* )². Wait, I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should recall the formula.

Wait, I think the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is given by P = (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / (a / R_* )) ) or something along those lines. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_*)² * (something else). 

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relative sizes. For a planet to transit, it must cross our line of sight. The chance of this is higher if the star is smaller (so the planet is a larger fraction of the star's disk) and if the planet is closer, because the orbital distance a is smaller, making the transit more likely.

So, the probability P should be higher for planets with smaller a and larger R_p, as well as smaller R_*.

In this problem, both planets have the same mass, but different a and R_*.

Wait, the question says that the two host stars have the same radii. So R_* is the same for both stars.

Wait, Planet_1's star has a mass twice that of Planet_2's star, but same radius. So R_1 = R_2.

So, since R_* is same for both planets, we can ignore that factor.

Now, a is the orbital period-related parameter. Since Planet_1 has a shorter period (3 times shorter), its semi-major axis a is smaller. Because, from Kepler's law, the period P is related to a^3/(M_*). Since M_* for Planet_1 is twice that of Planet_2, let's compute a for each.

Wait, let's think about Kepler's third law. P² = (4π²/G(M_* + m_p)) * a^3. Since the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, we can approximate M_* + m_p ≈ M_*. So P² ∝ a^3 / M_*. 

So for Planet_1: P1 = P2 / 3. (Since P1 is three times shorter than P2.)

But M1 = 2 M2.

So for each planet, (P^2) = (a^3)/(M_*). 

Let me express a in terms of P and M.

a^3 = G M_* (P/(2π))^2 * 4π² / G, wait, better to write the formula as a^3 = (G M_* P²)/(4π²).

So for Planet_1: a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1²) / (4π²) = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π² )

Same for Planet_2: a2^3 = (G M2 P2^2) / (4 π² )

So let's compute the ratio a1^3 / a2^3.

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M2) * (P2^2 / 9) ) ] / [ M2 * P2^2 ) ] 

= (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculate (2/9)^(1/3): 2 is about 8^(1/3) is 2, 9 is about 27^(1/3)=3. So 2/9 is (8/27) * (1/1.5), but wait, 2/9 is approximately 0.222. So cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6.

Alternatively, compute (2/9)^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) is ~1.26; 9^(1/3) is ~2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606. So a1 ≈ 0.606 * a2.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2.

Now, the transit probability P is proportional to (R_p / a)^2, perhaps? Or maybe (R_p / R_*)² * (1 / a). Wait, I'm still a bit confused about the exact formula.

Wait, I just found a formula in my notes (or maybe it's in my memory): The probability of a planet transiting is approximately (R_* / a) * (R_p / R_* )². Or perhaps it's (R_p / R_*)² divided by (a / R_* ). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The transit depth is (R_p / R_*)^2. But the probability of transit depends on the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The probability is roughly (R_* / a), because the star's diameter is 2 R_*, and the planet's path across the sky is a circle with diameter a (in the plane of the sky). So the probability is (2 R_*) / a. Because the planet's orbit has an angular size of a (in the sky), and the star's angular size is 2 R_* / distance. But since a is the orbital distance (in meters), the angular size would be a / D, where D is the distance to the star. Hmm, but perhaps the formula is expressed in terms of a and R_*, ignoring the distance.

Wait, the formula I remember is P = (R_* + R_p) / a. Since R_p << R_*, this approximates to R_* / a. So P is proportional to (R_* ) / a.

But since both stars have the same R_*, the probability is inversely proportional to a. So the planet with smaller a has higher P.

So for Planet_1, a is smaller, so P1 is higher than P2.

Wait, let's calculate the transit probabilities. Since P = R_* / a, and R_* is same for both, P1 = R_* / a1, P2 = R_* / a2. So the ratio P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) → since a1 = 0.606 a2, P1/P2 = a2/(0.606 a2) ) = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2. So Planet_1 has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers should choose Planet_1.

Looking back at the options:

Options C and D suggest Planet_1 is preferred with higher probability. Let's see the options:

Option C: ~1.65 times higher → which matches what I calculated.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is approximately proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit stars with the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) corresponds to a higher transit probability.

### Step 1: Orbital Period and Semi-Major Axis
Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto \frac{a^3}{M_*} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period and \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star. For Planet_1, the orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2 (\( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \)), and the host star of Planet_1 is twice as massive (\( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \)).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:
\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{*,2} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{*,1} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{M_{*,2} \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{2M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{1}{18}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{1}{18}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606.
\]

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
Since \( P \propto \frac{1}{a} \), the transit probability ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.606} \approx 1.65.
\]

### Conclusion
Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times higher transit probability than Planet_2. Therefore, the researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1.
