Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about gene interactions related to anthracnose resistance in white lupine. I'm a bit rusty on genetics, but I'll think it through.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants and some double mutants. The results are about how resistant each mutant plant is to the disease compared to the wild type.

The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance, which I guess is the maximum. The mutants have varying levels: for example, g1 is 75%, which is less than control but not very bad. But g2 is 0%, meaning it's completely susceptible. G3 is 50%, which is halfway.

Then the double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, which is really bad. g2g3 and g1g2 are both 0%. Hmm.

I remember that when you have epistasis, it's about how genes affect the same pathway. If two mutations have additive effects, they might be in parallel pathways. If one mutation makes a certain phenotype regardless of the other, it's epistatic.

Wait, wait. Let me think. In epistasis, the downstream gene is epistatic to the upstream gene. Because the upstream gene's product feeds into the downstream one. So if a mutation in the downstream gene (epistatic) masks the effect of the upstream gene, then the downstream gene is epistatic.

So, for example, if G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then if you knock out G2, you can't activate G1 and G3, so the resistance would be low. But if G1 or G3 are downstream, their single knockouts might have some effect, but their double knockouts would show even worse.

Wait, the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, that transcription factor would be in a regulatory role, perhaps activating other genes.

Looking at the data:

Wild type: 100%
g1: 75% (so, less resistance. So, the gene product of G1 contributes to resistance. Not a knockout that's lethal or anything, since it's 75%.)

g2: 0% (completely susceptible. So, knocking out G2 is bad.)

g3: 50% (so, less than wild type, but not as bad as g1 and some double mutants.)

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (so, combining g1 and g2 knockouts makes it even worse than either alone. g2 alone is 0%, so maybe G2 is the TF, and G1 is downstream.)

Wait, wait. g2 alone is 0% resistance. That's interesting. So, when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the disease at all. So G2 is probably a critical gene. If it's a transcription factor, then it activates other genes
