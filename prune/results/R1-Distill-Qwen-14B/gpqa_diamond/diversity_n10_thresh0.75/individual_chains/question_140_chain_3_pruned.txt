Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C. 

So, first, I need to figure out what these substances might be. Let's start by considering the reaction. Substance X reacts violently with Y, which is a liquid. Hmm, what liquids react violently with something? Maybe something like water? Or maybe an acid? Wait, but Y is a liquid, so perhaps it's something like sulfuric acid? Or maybe a base?

Wait, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is probably a noble gas, maybe. Because noble gases have complete valence shells and are monoatomic. Wait, no, actually, that's not necessarily true. Because the problem says "gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." Oh, wait, the molecule itself has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule is made of atoms where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons in each atom. So each atom must have equal protons and neutrons. That would mean the atomic number equals the neutron number. So for an atom, protons = neutrons. So the mass number would be 2 times the atomic number. 

Let me think of elements where the mass number is even. Let me see, for example, the element with atomic number 8 is oxygen. Its regular isotope is O-16, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So mass number 16. Another example is carbon-12, but that's C-12, which is 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But wait, that's the most common isotope. So if W is a gas, maybe CO2? No, because CO2 is a molecule, but each atom's protons and neutrons would have to be equal. Or perhaps W is carbon dioxide, but each C would be C-12, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Then each O would be O-16: 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So in CO2, each C contributes 6p, 6n; each O contributes 8p,8n. So the molecule as a whole would have (6+8*2) protons and (6 + 8*2) neutrons. Wait, but the problem says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for CO2, that would be 6 + 16 = 22 protons, and 6 + 16 = 22 neutrons. So 22 each, yes. That matches. So W could be CO2. But wait, wait. Because when you have a molecule like CO2, each atom's protons and neutrons are equal, but the molecule's total protons and neutrons are the same. So that fits. So W is CO2?

Wait, but CO2 is a gas, right. So when X reacts with Y, it releases CO2. What could X and Y be? Let me think. If X is something that reacts with an acid to produce CO2, maybe. Or perhaps Y is a carbonate. Wait, but Y is a liquid. Hmm. Or maybe Y is a strong acid, and X is a carbonate. For example, calcium carbonate reacts with sulfuric acid to produce CO2, water, and calcium sulfate. That's a violent reaction? Well, maybe not that violent, but in some cases, it can be exothermic.

Wait, but let's think about the precipitate G. When X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. So perhaps Y is a solution that causes X to form a precipitate. For example, if Y is water and X is a metal that doesn't react violently, but maybe that's not it. Alternatively, maybe Y is an acid, and X is a carbonate, but in that case, the reaction would produce CO2, water, and a salt. But if the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate.

Wait, let me think of another angle. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is roughly 4 degrees Celsius. What's a substance that has a melting point around there? Water has a melting point of 273 K (0°C), so 277 K is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe something like NaOH? No, NaOH's melting point is
