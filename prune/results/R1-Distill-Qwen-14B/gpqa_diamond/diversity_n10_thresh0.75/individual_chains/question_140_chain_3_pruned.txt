Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecules have the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, let's break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid-base reaction or something exothermic. The gas released, W, has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So, each molecule must have the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think about which gases fit that.

Wait, water is H2O. Each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. But H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (deuterium would have 1 proton, 2 neutrons). But water as a gas, maybe. Wait, another possibility: ammonia (NH3). But NH3 has 1 N and 3 H. Nitrogen has 7 protons and 7 neutrons in its most common isotope (¹⁴N). So NH3 would have 14 protons and (7+3*1) = 10 neutrons. No, that doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, what about carbon dioxide? CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 protons, and each O has 8. So for CO2, each molecule would have 6 + 2*8 = 22 protons and 6 + 2*8 = 22 neutrons? Wait, but that depends on the isotope. Carbon usually has 6 neutrons (¹²C), and oxygen is often ¹⁶O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So CO2 would have (6 + 16*2) = 38 protons and same number of neutrons. So 38 each. So yes, same number. But CO2 is a gas, right. So W
