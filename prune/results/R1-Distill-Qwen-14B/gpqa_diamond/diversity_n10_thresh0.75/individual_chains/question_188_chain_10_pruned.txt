Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. We need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interatomic distance—I think that refers to the lattice parameter, 'a'. Because in a rhombohedral crystal, all edges are equal, so a = b = c. Oh right, so each edge is 10 Angstroms.

The interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula from the Bragg's law, which is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ). Or wait, no, perhaps it's different because in rhombohedral systems, the angles between the axes are equal, so maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c and α = β = γ. So the formula for interplanar spacing would have some symmetry. Let me recall the formula. Oh right, for a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) planes is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ )

Wait
