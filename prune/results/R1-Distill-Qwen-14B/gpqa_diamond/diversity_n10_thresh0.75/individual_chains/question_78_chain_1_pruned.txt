Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrodynamics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question is asking about the potentials V and A at a point r at time t, given that the charge q was moving along a trajectory s(t). The charge was at some position earlier, at time tr, and that's when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at tr) to the observation point r. So, I think d is the displacement between the charge's position at tr and the observation point.

I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are related to the fields via Maxwell's equations. The scalar potential V contributes to the electric field, and the vector potential A contributes to the magnetic field. The total electric field is the gradient of V plus the time derivative of A, and the magnetic field is the curl of A, something like that.

Wait, but since the charge is moving, this becomes a relativistic problem, right? Or at least, it involves retarded potentials. Because the fields at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time. So I think this is about the retarded potentials formulation.

Right, the retarded time is the time it takes for the effects of the charge's motion to reach the observation point. So the charge's position at time tr is the one that affects the fields at time t, where t > tr. So the time tr is such that the light (or electromagnetic signal) from tr reaches r at t.

I recall the expression for the scalar potential V due to a moving charge. The general form is something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r’|) evaluated at the retarded time. But considering the charge's velocity, maybe there's a correction factor.

Wait, but the options don't look like they're using the usual form. Let's look at the options. Option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r). That looks like the static case, where the charge isn't moving—so it's just Coulomb's law. But if the charge is moving, wouldn't the potential involve some relativistic factor?

Hmm, but maybe V is still that expression because it's the scalar part, and the vector potential comes into play for the velocity part. Oh right, the vector potential A is typically proportional to the velocity of the charge.

Wait, the options also have expressions involving d and v. So d is the vector from where the field was generated (the charge's position at tr) to the observation point r. So d = r - r’(tr), I think. Or is it r’(tr) to r, so d is pointing from the charge's past position to r. So d is the vector from the charge's position at the retarded time to the observation point.

So, the denominator in the potentials might involve terms like |d| and the dot product of d and v. Because the charge's velocity affects the potentials.

Let me think about the expression for the vector potential. I remember that for the vector potential due to a moving
