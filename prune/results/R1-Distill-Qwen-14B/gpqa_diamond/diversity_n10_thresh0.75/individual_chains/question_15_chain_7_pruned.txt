Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and probabilities. Let me try to think through this step by step. I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on a few factors, like the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period usually means a smaller orbit. Oh wait, because orbital period relates to the distance via Kepler's third law. But the host stars have different masses too. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. That's interesting, so despite the mass difference, their sizes are the same.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability (P) is roughly (R_star + R_planet) divided by the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, since the planets are Earth-like, their radii are probably much smaller than the stars', so R_planet is negligible compared to R_star. So P â‰ˆ R_star / a, where a is the semi-major axis.

But how does a relate to the orbital period and the star's mass
