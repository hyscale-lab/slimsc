Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given values are its production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters.

I remember that the decay width is related to the lifetime of a particle. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is connected to the lifetime τ via the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ/τ, but wait, actually I think it's Γ = ħ * (1/τ). Or wait, maybe it's Γ = ħ multiplied by something else. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So for a particle with a width Γ (which is the uncertainty in energy ΔE), the lifetime τ is approximately ħ/(Γ). Because if ΔE is Γ, then Δt ≈ ħ/(Γ).

Wait, wait, actually, I think the correct formula is Γ = ħ * (1/τ), so τ = ħ/(Γ). Let me confirm: τ is the mean lifetime, and Γ is the total decay width. So yes, τ ≈ ħ / Γ. Right.

Once I have the lifetime, I can find out how far the meson travels before decaying. The mean decay distance would be the velocity v multiplied by the lifetime τ. So distance L = v * τ.

But wait, what's the velocity? Since the meson is produced with a certain energy, I need to find its velocity based on that energy.

The meson's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy relation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. From this, I can solve for momentum p.

Let me compute that. E in GeV, m in GeV as well. Let's compute E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Let's rearrange for p c: (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c
