Okay, I need to figure out which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. Let me think about what I know about SMEFT and symmetries.

So, SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that includes the Standard Model (SM) as a low-energy limit and incorporates higher-dimensional operators to account for physics beyond the SM. These operators are organized by their dimension. 

Now, the question is about which symmetries these operators must respect. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry.

First, I should recall what each of these symmetries is:

1. Lorentz symmetry: This includes rotations and boosts, so the theory must respect special relativity. Operators in SMEFT are constructed in a way that they are compatible with Lorentz symmetry. The SM respects this, so SMEFT would too because it's an extension.

2. Poincare symmetry: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position in space or time). Poincare symmetry implies momentum conservation. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT would as well. So all its operators must be Poincare-invariant.

Wait, but the question is whether all operators in SMEFT must respect these. SMEFT is built with operators that are Poincare-invariant, right? Because the SM is Poincare-invariant, and SMEFT is an effective theory built from it.

3. CP symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. CP symmetry means that the laws are the same if you swap particles with their antiparticles and mirror their spatial coordinates. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry in all cases. For example, CP violation is observed in certain processes like kaon oscillations. So do SMEFT operators have to respect CP? I don't think so. Because SMEFT allows for higher-dimension operators that might violate CP. So operators in SMEFT don't necessarily have to preserve CP. So this symmetry is not necessarily required.

4. CPT symmetry: CPT stands for Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The CPT theorem states that for any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. If a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it must respect CPT symmetry. The SM is Lorentz-invariant and thus respects CPT. SMEFT also respects Lorentz symmetry, so it must respect CPT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must preserve CPT.

So, the symmetries that must be respected are:

- Lorentz symmetry (1)
- Poincare symmetry (2)
- CPT symmetry (4)

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Poincare symmetry is a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if the theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry, so they must transform correctly under it. But the question is, are both Lorentz and Poincare required, or is one a subset of the other?

Wait, the SMEFT operators are constructed respecting the symmetries of the SM. The SM is Poincare-invariant, so SMEFT must also be. Therefore, all SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant. So both 1 and 2 are correct. Alternatively, wait, no: is Poincare symmetry and Lorentz symmetry both required, or is Poincare
