Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. It's about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the setup is that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving towards us, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. Hmm, need to get the direction straight.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So in this case, the speed of light inside the glass is 1/n because c is given as 1. So without any movement of the glass, the speed would be 1/n. But since the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this has to do with the observer's frame of reference. The glass is moving, so perhaps we need to consider a frame where the glass is moving and see how light's speed is perceived in that frame.

Wait, but light speed is always c in any inertial frame, right? Or does that only apply in a vacuum? Because in a medium, light's speed is lower. Oh wait, but the medium itself is moving. So the motion of the medium could affect the observed speed of the light.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about this. When the medium is moving, does the speed of light within it change according to some addition of velocities?

Wait, I think I should apply the velocity addition formula from relativity. But wait, is that applicable here? Because the speed of light in a medium is less than c. Hmm, but the glass isn't a vacuum, so maybe the usual relativistic velocity addition doesn't directly apply. Or does it? I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using the frame of the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v = 1/n. Then, the glass is moving at velocity v_lab (v?) towards the observer. So from the lab frame, what is the speed
