Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light beams and moving glass. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the setup: there's a light beam moving through a glass slab. The glass has an index of refraction n. Now, the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking, what's the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab?

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, right? Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. So normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed would be c/n. But here, the glass is moving, so I think I need to consider some sort of relative motion.

Wait, but hold on. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. But the light is going through the glass, which is itself moving. So how does this affect the observed speed of light?

I think this has to do with the frame of reference. The lab is our stationary frame, and the glass is moving. So the light's speed as seen from the lab is not just c/n, because the glass's motion might add to it in some way. Or maybe not? Because in Einstein's theory, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. Oh wait, but wait
