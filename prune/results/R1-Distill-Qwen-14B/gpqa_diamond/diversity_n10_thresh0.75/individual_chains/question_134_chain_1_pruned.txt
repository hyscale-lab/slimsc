Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, the question says we're mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions typically involve an acid and a base reacting to form water and a salt. But wait, there are two acids here, HCl and H2SO4, and a base, Ba(OH)2. Oh, so maybe the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

But wait, how do I calculate the enthalpy change? I think the enthalpy of neutralization is usually calculated per mole of H+ reacting with OH-. The standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here because the reaction might involve more H+.

Wait, each acid contributes H+ ions. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely: HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid as well, but wait, does it dissociate completely in aqueous solution? I think it's a diprotic acid. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. In dilute solutions, H2SO4 dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.
