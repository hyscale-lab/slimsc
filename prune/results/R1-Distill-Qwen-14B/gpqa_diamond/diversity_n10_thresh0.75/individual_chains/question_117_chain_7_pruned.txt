Okay, so I've got this question about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually involves chiral centers, where a carbon has four different substituents. So, I need to check each of these organic compounds to see if they have any chiral centers or other sources of asymmetry.

Let's go through each option one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected in a 1,1' fashion. So the structure would have two phenyl rings attached at position 1 on each. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, looking at the substituents: each ring has nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Since each ring is attached to the biphenyl, are there any chiral centers? Wait, the rings might have some symmetry. The positions 2 and 6 on each ring â€“ would that create any asymmetry? Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl itself can have some kind of stereoisomerism. Biphenyls can have axial chirality, especially if the substituents are in positions that create a non-superimposable mirror image. If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the whole molecule isn't symmetric, then it could have optical isomerism. So for 1, if the substituents on each biphenyl ring create a situation where the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image, then it has optical isomers. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the two nitro groups on 6 and the two carboxylate on 2 could make the molecule symmetrical, but wait, the rings are connected in a way that their substituents might not mirror each other. Alternatively, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that allow for a twist, like in biphenyls, then it might have axial chirality, which would lead to enantiomers. So I'll tentatively say that this compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's write its structure
