Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about two energy levels with different lifetimes and their energy difference. Hmm. I remember something about lifetimes and the uncertainty principle.

Wait, the question says the lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So, the shorter the lifetime (Δt), the larger the uncertainty in energy (ΔE).

Wait, but the lifetimes here are the mean lifetimes, right? So, the uncertainty in time Δt would be roughly the same as the lifetime τ. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by τ. But wait, I'm a bit hazy on the exact relation. Let me think again. The time-energy uncertainty principle says that ΔE * τ ≈ ħ/(2π), sometimes. Or maybe it's ΔE * τ ≥ ħ/2? I'm not entirely sure, but I know the general idea is that a shorter lifetime leads to a larger energy uncertainty.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So the one with a shorter lifetime (10^-9 sec) will have a larger uncertainty in energy than the one with longer lifetime (10^-8 sec). Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, their signals might overlap, making them indistinct.

Wait, but maybe the energy difference just needs to be larger than each of their individual uncertainties? Because if the difference is bigger than each uncertainty, then the two states won't be lost in each other's uncertainty. So for both to be resolved, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty of each. Hmm, but each has a different uncertainty.

Wait, state 1 has a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 s, so its energy uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, state 2 has τ2 = 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. Since τ2 is larger than τ1, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1. So the larger uncertainty is ΔE1.

So to resolve them, the energy difference between E2 and E1 (assuming E2 > E1) must be greater than the larger uncertainty ΔE1. Because if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states won't be confused with each other. If it's smaller than the larger
