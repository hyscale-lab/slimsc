Okay, so I've got this problem about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, let me try to work through it. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. 

Alright, the field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². That means the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, wait, that means the vector field is pointing radially outward or inward, right? Because it's only got a radial component.

Wait, vector fields can have divergence, so I need to find the divergence of this field and then integrate it over the volume of the sphere. Oh right, the divergence theorem might come into play here. Because the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary.

Let me recall the divergence theorem. It states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume equals the integral of the vector field dotted with the outward normal over the surface enclosing that volume. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA.

In this case, the volume is a sphere of radius R. So the surface is the sphere's surface, and the normal vector n is in the radial direction. So the surface integral becomes ∫ (f · r̂) dA, since n is r̂ on the sphere's surface. 

But wait, f has only a radial component. So f(r) · r̂ is just the radial component of f. The magnitude of f is 1/r², so on the surface (r = R), f(r) · r̂ is 1/R². 

So the surface integral becomes ∫ (1/R²) dA over the sphere. The integral of dA over a sphere is just the surface area, which is 4π R². So 1/R² * 4π R² = 4π. 

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence should be 4π. But wait, wait a second. Is that the case? Or am I missing something here?

Wait, another approach is to actually compute the divergence of f and integrate it directly. Let's see. The field f is radial, so in spherical coordinates, f
