Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ] / N. N is the normalization constant, which they've given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure.

Wait, relative entropy... right, it's also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence in some contexts. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state and rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.

So, first, I think I need to find the density matrix rho for the given state. The state is a superposition of two coherent states, |alpha> and |-alpha>, so the density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|. Let me write that out.

The state |psi> is (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N. So rho = |psi><psi| = [ (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha> ) (cos phi <alpha| + sin phi < -alpha| ) ] / N².

Expanding that, rho = [ cos² phi |alpha><alpha| + cos phi sin phi |alpha><-alpha| + cos phi sin phi | -alpha><alpha| + sin² phi |-alpha><-alpha| ] / N².

Since N is the normalization, N² is 1 / [1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)], right? Because N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)), so N² is 1/(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

Wait, no. Wait, N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)), so N squared is (1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). So when we write rho, it's divided by N squared, which is 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²). Hmm, that's important for later.

Now, the reference state tau is Gaussian. I'm not entirely sure which Gaussian state is being used here as the reference. For the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, the reference Gaussian state would typically be a thermal state or a squeezed state, but I'm not certain. Wait, but more commonly, when measuring non-Gaussianity, the reference is usually the state that minimizes the relative entropy, which might be a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Or perhaps it's the closest Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, for a two-mode state, sometimes the reference is the separable Gaussian state.

Wait, but the problem states that tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So perhaps for the calculation, we assume a specific Gaussian state as the reference. Maybe for the cat state, the reference is the state that is the same as the cat state but without the interference terms, i.e., a statistical mixture of the two coherent states. Let me think: the cat state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so if we take the density matrix as |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha><-alpha| each with probabilities cos² phi and sin² phi, that would be a diagonal density matrix in the coherent state basis. But wait, that's not Gaussian, because the coherent state is a Gaussian state, but a mixture of two coherent states is also Gaussian? Or not?

Wait, no. A coherent state is a Gaussian state, and a mixture of two coherent states would still be a Gaussian state because the density matrix of a mixture is a convex combination of projectors, each of which is a Gaussian state. So wait, but in our case, the density matrix rho is a superposition, not a mixture. So rho is a pure state, and it's a superposition of two coherent states. So the reference Gaussian state might be the state that is the mixture of the two coherent states in the same way.

Wait, no. Wait, the relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But wait, the del_b given here is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Oh, wait, the formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau.

Wait, no. Kullback-Leibler divergence is S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(tau) when both are considered with certain conditions. Wait, no, the KL divergence is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). So the given formula del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)] which is equal to S(rho) + S(tau) - 2 S(tau)? No, wait, let me think.

Actually, the formula given is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). So this is S(rho) - S(tau), but that's not the KL divergence. KL divergence is S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the mutual entropy. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to get back to the problem.

So, for the relative entropy measure, which is the quantity del_b, we need to compute two terms: the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau. Because del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). Or wait, the given formula is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). That's correct, because trace(rho ln rho) is the entropy S(rho), and trace(tau ln tau) is S(tau). So the measure is S(rho) - S(tau).

Wait, but that doesn't quite make sense because the KL divergence is S(rho) - S(rho, tau)... Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the formula is the opposite, but perhaps the problem defines it that way.

In any case, the problem defines the measure as this difference. So regardless, I need to compute S(rho) and S(tau), then subtract them.

So, the first step: compute the entropy S(rho) of the given state, which is a pure state. Because rho is a pure state, its entropy S(rho) is zero, because S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho) = 0 for a pure state. Wait, that's right. Because rho is a pure state, so rho is a projector, and the entropy is zero. So S(rho) = 0. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the state is |psi><psi|, so the density matrix is pure. So yes, S(rho) = 0.

Wait, so that would make del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that can't be right because non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is, and it's non-negative. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me
