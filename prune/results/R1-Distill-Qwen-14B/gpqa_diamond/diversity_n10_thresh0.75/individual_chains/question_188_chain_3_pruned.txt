Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. Wait, what's a rhombohedral structure again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal system where all the lattice vectors are of equal length, and the angles between them are all the same. So in this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. 

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance... right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember the formula for interplanar spacing involves the Miller indices and the lattice parameters. Oh wait, the general formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... something with the angles). 

Wait, no, wait. For a cubic system, the interplanar distance is a/(sqrt(h² +k² + l²)), but rhombohedral isn't cubic. Oh right, I think in a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit more complicated. Let me think. Oh right, for a rhombohedral lattice, the formula is d = (a^2) / (h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ))) and then take the square root in the denominator. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me get the formula right.

Wait, another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / a² + (2hk cos α) / a² + (2hl cos β) / a² + (2kl cos γ) / a² )

Or maybe it's expressed in terms of the reciprocal lattice. Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the metric tensor. Alternatively, I recall that for a rhombohedral lattice with a = b = c, and α = β = γ, the formula simplifies. 

Let me think about the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system. The general formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/a²) + (k²
