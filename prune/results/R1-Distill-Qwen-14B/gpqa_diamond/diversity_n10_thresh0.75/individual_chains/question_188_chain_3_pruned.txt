Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal but the angles between them are not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I think the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh right, in a general crystal system, especially for cubic systems, it's simpler because the angles are 90 degrees, but for rhombohedral or other systems, the formula is more complicated.

Wait, no, actually, I might be mixing it up. Another formula I've heard about is using the reciprocal of the lattice parameters. Oh right, the interplanar distance is given by 1/d² equals the sum of (h²)/(a²) plus similar terms for other directions, but that's when angles are 90 degrees. For non-orthogonal systems, it gets more involved.

Wait, I think the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) (1/a²) - (2hk cos γ)/(a²) - ... ) )

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong. Another approach: perhaps using the structure factor or the metric tensor to find the interplanar distance.

Alternatively, the formula I think is correct is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

Wait, no, because in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are the same, so for (111), the calculation would involve each of the terms.

Wait, so the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²/l² + k²/m² + l²/n²) + ... )

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral crystal with a = b = c and angles α, β, γ (which in this case are all 30 degrees
