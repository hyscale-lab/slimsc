Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state—that's the lowest energy state, right? So the next state after that would be the first excited state. I remember that for rotational and vibrational energy levels, the transitions happen when a photon is absorbed or emitted.

In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels have two parts: rotational and vibrational. But since the question is about moving to the next lowest energy state, I'm not entirely sure if we're looking at a rotational transition, a vibrational transition, or both. Oh wait, the next state—maybe it's the next in terms of total energy, which could be a combination of rotational and vibrational changes.

Wait, the next state with the lowest possible energy would probably be the next level in the rotational or vibrational part. But perhaps it's a transition that changes either rotation or vibration, not both. Hmm. Or maybe it's a change in the vibrational state, since the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), so the next would be v=1. And the vibrational energy change would require a photon with energy equal to the vibrational energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule transitions from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to a state where either J increases or v increases. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe the next state is the lowest energy state that's higher than the fundamental. So the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next would be the first excited state, which could be either a rotational or vibrational transition. But which one has the lower energy difference?

Let me think about the vibrational energy levels. For a harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are equally spaced. The energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is ħω. Rotational energy levels are quantized as well, with E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) J(J+1), where I is the moment of inertia. The spacing between rotational levels isn't uniform, but the lowest transition is from J=0 to J=1. Let's
