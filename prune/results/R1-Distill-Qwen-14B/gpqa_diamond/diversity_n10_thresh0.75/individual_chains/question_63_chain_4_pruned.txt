Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the rotation-vibration model, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that will cause a transition to the next lowest energy state.

First, I remember that the quantum rotation-vibration model is a combination of rotational and vibrational energy levels. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy stateâ€”so both rotation and vibration are at their ground states. The photon is absorbed, so the energy of the photon should match the energy difference between the current state and the next higher state.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental vibrational state is the lowest vibrational state, which is n=0. And for rotation, the lowest state is J=0. So the molecule is at (v=0, J=0).

We're to find the photon that switches it to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The next state would be the next higher energy state, which could involve either vibrational or rotational excitation. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model (which I think is another term for the rotation-vibration coupling model), the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing some terms. The non-rigid rotor model considers that the bond length isn't fixed, so it's a bit more complex than the rigid rotor. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps I just
