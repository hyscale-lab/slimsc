Alright, so I have this physics problem to solve. Hmm, it's about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when a specific nucleus (Li with 3 neutrons) is moving at 0.96c. So, it's a relativistic mechanics problem, right? Because when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light (like 0.96c), we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity.

Okay, so the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. Let me think: Lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that means its isotope is Li-6 because 3 (protons) +3 (neutrons) =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6.

Next, I remember that the energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0 * c², where m0 is the rest mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, and gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem gives options in GeV, so I think I should calculate the total energy, which includes kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Or is it just the kinetic energy? Hmm, I think in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually refer to the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, sometimes it's the total energy. I need to clarify this.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)"—so I think they're asking for the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy. Because in accelerators, the energy given to the particles is their kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. But sometimes, people refer to the kinetic energy as the energy imparted by the collider. Hmm, I need to be precise here.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the term "energy" to refer
