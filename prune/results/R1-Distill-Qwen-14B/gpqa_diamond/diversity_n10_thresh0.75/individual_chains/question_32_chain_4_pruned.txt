Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is: What is the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c? And the options are given as A to D.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. The prompt says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons and some neutrons. Wait, normal lithium-7 has 3 protons and 4 neutrons, because 3+4=7. But this X has 3 neutrons, so maybe it's lithium-6? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

So the mass of X would be the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. But wait, maybe I can calculate it using the atomic mass. Alternatively, perhaps I can just use the mass number as an approximation for relativistic calculations? Hmm.

Wait, but in particle physics, when dealing with heavy ions, the energy is often calculated based on the mass number. Because for heavy ions, the mass is roughly the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. Since protons and neutrons have about the same mass, the mass number (A) is approximately the number of nucleons, so the mass would be A times the mass of a proton or neutron.

So for Li-6, A is 6. So the mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, since the mass of a neutron is almost the same. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². But wait, protons are composite particles, so their mass is around 938 MeV. So the mass of the nucleus X is about 6 * 938 MeV/c²? Wait, but that would be 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV/c². But wait, wait a minute. Let me think again.

Wait, no, wait. Because the mass of a nucleus isn't exactly A times the mass of a proton or neutron due to binding energy, but for heavy ions and at high energies, sometimes people approximate the mass as A times the mass of a proton. Because the binding energy is much smaller compared
