Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. It says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities, which are 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question says to assume the stars radiate as black bodies and asks by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

Wait, but how do I find the temperatures of the two stars? Because I don't have them directly. Oh, but the question mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (around 2.9×10^-3 m·K). So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T.

Wait a minute, that can't be right. Because if they have the same λ_max, then T would be the same. Oh, but wait, the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So yes, same λ_max implies same T. So T1 = T2.

But wait, the stars have different masses and radii. How does that affect their temperatures? Well, maybe this is a trick question because if their temperatures are the same, then luminosity just depends on radius squared. Let me think.

So, for L1 and L2:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T^4

L2 = 4π R2² σ T^4

But since T is the same for both
