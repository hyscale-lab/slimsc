Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde and going through several steps to produce product 3. I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3.

Let me start by understanding the starting material. Trans-cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a double bond. The structure is something like CH₂=CH-C(O)H. Wait, actually, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic compound. Oh right, it's benzaldehyde with a propenal group attached. So the structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. No, wait: trans-cinnamaldehyde is actually (E)-3-phenylpropenal-2. So the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, I think I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think: the structure of cinnamaldehyde is a benzene ring connected to a CH₂ group, then a double bond between the next two carbons, and an aldehyde group. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, maybe it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO is cinnamaldehyde. Or is it Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, wait I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? Or maybe it's
