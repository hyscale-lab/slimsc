Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like they might be an exoplanet transiting the star.

The question is, if we ignore the spots and instead have an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would the radius of the planet be relative to the star's radius? The options are A to D, some fractions.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness (the transit depth) is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. Since area is proportional to radius squared, that's where that comes from.

But wait, the problem mentions that the star has spots. Oh, right, the spots are cooler and darker, so when they rotate into view, the total brightness of the star as seen from Earth changes. So the star's brightness without spots is our baseline, but with spots, the brightness fluctuates as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, but the problem says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the observed photometric variations from the spots are similar to what a planet would cause. So the goal is to find the exoplanet radius that would produce the same signal amplitude as the spot-induced variations.

So first, I think I need to calculate the change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the change caused by an exoplanet transit, and set them equal to find the planet radius.

Let me break it down step by step.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. The spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4π R^2 σ T^4, where R is the radius, but since R is the same for both the star and the planet (the planet's radius is Rpl, Rstar is the star's radius), I can maybe think in terms of relative areas.

Wait, but the spots have a filling factor. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of half the star's surface. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π R^2), since a hemisphere is half the surface area. Wait, no, wait. The surface area is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Is that right? Or wait, maybe the filling factor is the fraction of the total surface covered. Hmm, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the spots cover
