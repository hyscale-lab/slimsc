Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let me read it again and think through it step by step. 

The question is about a star with certain characteristics and some spots on it. The scenario is that these spots cause brightness variations that could be mistaken for an exoplanet. But we need to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots do.

Alright, let's break down the given information.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So, Rstar = R_sun. But I don't think the exact value is needed; maybe it will just cancel out in the ratio.

One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor usually refers to the area covered by spots. So, the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total area covered is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) ? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, since a hemisphere is half the surface, the 20% filling factor might mean 20% of the entire star's surface? Wait, no. Because the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So if the star's total surface area is 4πR², then a hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere's area. So spots area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Is that right? Or is the filling factor the fraction of the entire star's surface? Wait, the problem says "filling factor of 20%", which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So yeah, 20% of the hemisphere's area is spot.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000K. So the spots are at 5000K? Because 6000 - 1000 = 5000K. So the spots are 5000K.

As the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, the spots will rotate into and out of the observed hemisphere. Wait,
