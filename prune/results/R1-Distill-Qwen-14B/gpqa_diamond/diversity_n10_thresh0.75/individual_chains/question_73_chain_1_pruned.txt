Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds... Right, that means I should probably be using special relativity equations.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so they're moving in the same direction, which affects how I calculate their relative speed.

First, I think I need to find the relative speed between them. Oh wait, wait. When two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because of relativity. I remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)).

So plugging in the numbers: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6*0.5)c²/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh wait, that's approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, some have 0.14c as relative speed.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma * m c². So I need to calculate each separately and sum them.

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.25)) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈
