Okay, so I'm trying to answer this organic chemistry question. Let's see what I can figure out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the initial reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, giving a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are provided. IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl group (C=O), so maybe an epoxide or a ketone. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is an adamantane derivative, and when treated with a strong base like KOH, I think it might undergo elimination, like an E2 mechanism. Since there are two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, perhaps a di-elimination occurs, forming an epoxide? Or maybe it's a ring-opening process.

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on opposite ends of the adamantane structure. Heating with KOH, a strong base, probably causes dehydrohalogenation. Each Br would leave, and the base would abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. But since it's 1,3 positions, the elimination would form an epoxide? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's forming an adamantyl oxide, or maybe removing two HBr molecules to form a diene or a ring-contracted structure?

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical for an ester, ketone, or maybe an amide. But since the starting material is dibromo and we're using KOH, I don't think it's an ester. So maybe a ketone? Or perhaps it's an epoxide, but I'm not sure. Wait, wait, another thought: when dibromides are treated with KOH, they can form epoxides via elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an epoxide. But that would form a bridge, right? Because in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridges. So perhaps forming an epoxide would create a bridge, making it a more strained structure, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think
