Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required to make a certain nucleus move at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity formulas, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6 (Li-6), right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Now, the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a moving object depends on its gamma factor. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma. Let me calculate the denominator first. v is 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me make sure. 1/0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is approximately 3.5714. So gamma is about 3.571, but maybe more accurately, I should calculate it more precisely. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 0.96 squared is actually 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

But wait, when I was a student, I remember that gamma can be calculated as (1 - v²/c²)^(-1/2). So for v = 0.96c, let me compute it step by step.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².
So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.
Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

Yeah, that looks right.

Now, the energy of the nucleus is the relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m
