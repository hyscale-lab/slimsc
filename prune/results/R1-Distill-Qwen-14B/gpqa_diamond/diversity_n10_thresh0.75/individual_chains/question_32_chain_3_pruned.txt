Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. The question is asking about the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. 

Wait, Li is lithium, right? So the standard lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So X is Li-6. 

The problem is about relativistic energy, so I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. Since the nucleus is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, non-relativistic formulas won't cut it. 

I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity. So gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

First, let's compute gamma. v is 0.96c, so v^2 is (0.96)^2 c^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, so gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... So about 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass of a nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/cÂ², same with a neutron. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So total rest mass is 6 * 938 MeV. Let's compute that.

6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. That's 5.628 GeV because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So the rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV. 

Wait, but wait a second. I've heard that in particle physics, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons because of binding energy. But when calculating the rest mass energy for relativistic purposes, do I need to account for that? Hmm. The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's safe to assume
