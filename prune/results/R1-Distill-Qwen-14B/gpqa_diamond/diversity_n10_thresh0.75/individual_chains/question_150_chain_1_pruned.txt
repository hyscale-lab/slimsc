Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Hmm, I think I need to break this down into smaller parts.

First, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is C8H9NO. The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. So for this, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds or something like that.

Now, looking at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows:

9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let's think about each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for 1H. Triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. A triplet in that region could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But sometimes, if it's in a conjugated system, it might be a bit upfield or downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an amine or something else, but more likely aldehyde or a ketone. But since the aldehyde is a singlet usually because it's only one proton, unless it's coupling with another proton. Hmm, but wait, in this case, it's a triplet. So maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to two protons. Wait, like in a conjugated system maybe? Like an enal?

Wait, but other possibilities for a peak around 9.7 ppm: maybe an aromatic ring with substituents, but that's lower than that. Wait, another thought: maybe it's an aldehyde, and the coupling is with the adjacent CH2 group. But that's a stretch.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 as doublets, each with 2H. Those look like two sets of aromatic protons. So perhaps the compound has two aromatic rings, each with two protons as doublets. That suggests maybe para-substituted rings. For example, each ring has two protons that are each a doublet, perhaps due to coupling with each other.

Then there's a 6.27 peak, broad singlet integrating for 2H. Broad singlet could be an exchangeable proton, but wait, 2H exchangeable? Hmm, maybe it's an aromatic ring with two adjacent protons, but in a conjugated system. Or maybe it's an enol proton? Or perhaps it's a diol or something. Alternatively, maybe it's an alkenyl group. Wait, a double bond with adjacent protons that are split into a broad signal. Or perhaps it's a conjugated dienol, but I'm not sure.

The next peak is 3.66 ppm, a doublet for 2H. That might indicate a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, maybe an oxygen. Like OCH2 something. Or perhaps a CH2 adjacent to an aromatic ring. Wait, but considering the molecular formula has an N, maybe an amide or something else, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest that. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO, so one N. So perhaps an amine or an amide, but looking at the NMR, no obvious amines except maybe in the aldehyde. Wait, aldehyde is R
