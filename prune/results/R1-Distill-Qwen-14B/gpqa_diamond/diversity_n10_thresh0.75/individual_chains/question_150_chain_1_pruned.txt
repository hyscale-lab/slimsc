Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. I'm a bit new to NMR and organic chemistry reactions, so I'll have to take it slow.

First, I need to figure out what the original compound is based on the molecular formula and the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, so here: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That usually comes from rings and double bonds. So maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), some double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data:

The peaks are at:
9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me think about each. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet, integrating for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton, as they usually appear around 9-10 ppm. The triplet might mean it's next to a CH2 group or something with two protons. Or maybe it's adjacent to another proton that's split into a triplet. So maybe an aldehyde at one end of a chain, like RCHO.

The next peak at 6.98 is a doublet with 2H. That suggests maybe two equivalent aromatic protons. And 6.51 is another doublet, 2H. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two Hs are equivalent, and their coupling would result in a doublet. So maybe the benzene has two substituents, one at each para position.

Wait, but the other peaks at 6.27 (bs, 2H) might be vinyl protons. Because they're broad but as a doublet of some sort. And the 3.66 (d, 2H) could be a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen (like an OCH2 group), but the doublet suggests each H is next to one other H. So maybe it's connected to something else.

Putting this together, I'm thinking the compound has a benzene ring, maybe with two substituents at para positions. One substituent could be a group that includes an aldehyde, and another substituent could be something else. Or perhaps it's a biphenyl structure?

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons: 8. If it's a benzene ring (6 C), then the substituents are 2 more. But let's see, perhaps the structure is something like two benzene rings connected by a side chain. Wait, but C8 would mean two benzene rings (each has 6 C) would be C12, which is too much. So maybe it's one benzene ring and another
