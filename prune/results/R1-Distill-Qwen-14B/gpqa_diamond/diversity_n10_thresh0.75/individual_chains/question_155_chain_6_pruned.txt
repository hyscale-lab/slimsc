Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty of P_z for a given state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it. So, there's an operator P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has a matrix form given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, right. The uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. So for P_z, I'll need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

But first, I need to compute the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩. That's the average value of P_z in the given state. To do that, I should multiply the state vector by the P_z matrix, then take the inner product, right? Or wait, actually, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state multiplied by P_z multiplied by the state. But since all the entries in the state are real here, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me write down the state vector ψ. It's a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So ψ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

The matrix P_z is given as:
Row 1: [ℏ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ℏ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. The matrix form of P_z has first row (ℏ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ℏ). So it's a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I'll compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Calculating that: ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is a row vector [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2].

Multiplying ψ† with P_z gives a row vector:

First element: (-1/2)*ℏ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = (-1/2)ℏ
Second element: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*0 = 0
Third element: (-1/2)*0 + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ℏ) = (1/2)ℏ

Wait, no, no. Because matrix multiplication is row times column. Wait, no, when you multiply ψ† (a 1x3 matrix) by P_z (3x3), you get a 1x3 vector. Let me compute each component.

The first component of ψ† P_z is:
sum_{j=1 to 3} ψ_j^* * (P_z)_j1
Wait, wait, no. Because P_z is diagonal, so (P_z)_j1 is zero unless j=1.

Wait no, no, wait. Let me correct that. When you multiply ψ† (which is a row vector) by P_z (a diagonal matrix), each element is the product of the row's element and the diagonal element of P_z.

So, ψ† P_z is the row vector [ (-1/2)*ℏ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ℏ) ) ].

So that's [ (-ℏ/2), 0, (ℏ/2) ].

Then, multiply this row vector by ψ (the column vector):

So, [ (-ℏ/2), 0, (ℏ/2) ] multiplied by [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]

Each component is:

= (-ℏ/2)*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (ℏ/2)*(-1/2)
= (ℏ/4) + 0 - (ℏ/4)
= 0.

Wait, that's zero? So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero? Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal
