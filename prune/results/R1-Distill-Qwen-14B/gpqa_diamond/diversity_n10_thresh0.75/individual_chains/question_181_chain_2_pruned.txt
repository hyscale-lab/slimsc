Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I know.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Hmm, wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III branch stopped, the change in neutrino flux here on Earth would be noticeable after about that time. But since the question is about the current flux, the effects are already here.

The question is about the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1 over flux2.

Wait, I remember that most solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, particularly the pp-I branch. But there's also this pp-III branch. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the production of boron-8 through a different process. Or wait, maybe pp-III is part of the same chain but a minor contributor? I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

Wait, the pp chain. The main process is the proton-proton chain, which produces helium-4. The pp-I branch produces a lot of positrons and neutrinos. Then there's the pp-II and pp-III, which are higher-energy branches, but I'm not entirely sure. Oh, right, the pp-II and pp-III branches involve higher proton temperatures, so they contribute a smaller fraction of the total neutrino flux because they happen at higher temperatures which are less prevalent in the Sun's core.

Wait, neutrinos from the Sun come mainly from two processes: the dominant pp-I branch, and then the less dominant, higher-energy pp-II and pp-III. Oh, but wait, I think the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to pp-I. So if the pp-III branch stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (like those in band 2: 800-900 keV) would be affected more than the lower ones (700-800 keV).

So, when the pp-III branch stops, the neutrino flux from that process ceases. So for the higher energy bands, like 800-900
