Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Hmm, let me think. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

So the setup is that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III reactions stopped, any effect on the neutrinos we detect would only be noticeable after that delay.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what do I remember about solar neutrinos and their sources?

Solar neutrinos are mainly produced in two main processes: the proton-proton chain (pp) and the CNO cycle. The pp chain has branches, like pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the others. So if pp-III stops, the neutrino flux from that branch would stop as well.

Wait, but the other reactions (like pp-I and pp-II, and the CNO cycle) are still ongoing. So the neutrinos from these other sources would continue unaffected. So the neutrino flux from pp-III, which contributes to certain energy bands, would drop to zero. But wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III are probably in higher energy ranges than the others. So if pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in higher energy bands would decrease.

But the question is about the ratio of flux between two specific bands. Let's think about the energy ranges. Band 1 is 700-800 keV and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So Band 1 is lower energy than Band 2. 

Wait, but the pp-III process produces higher-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy bands (like Band 2) would lose their contribution from pp-III. But other processes, like the CNO cycle, produce neutrinos of different energies. Do I remember which processes produce which energies?

The pp-I and pp-II processes produce lower-energy neutrinos, typically around a few tens of keV to maybe 100s of keV
