Okay, so I have this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated north or south poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles. Like, you can't have a single pole; they come in pairs. So that's called the principle of magnetic duality or something like that.

Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. I think one of them deals with the divergence of the magnetic field. Oh wait, right! The first equation, Gauss's law for magnetism, says that the divergence of B is zero. Which implies that there are no isolated magnetic charges because the divergence being zero means the field lines are continuous, no monopoles.

So in this parallel universe, if a magnet can have an isolated north or south pole, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist. So how would that affect Maxwell's equations? Let me think. In our case, because there are no monopoles, the divergence of B is zero. But if monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. So the equation for Gauss's law in magnetism would change. That equation would now have a term related to the magnetic charge density, right?

Then what about the other equations? Oh wait, the other equations are Faraday's Law (which deals with the curl of E), Ampère's Law (curl of H and current), and Gauss's Law for electric fields (div E = rho/epsilon). 

Wait, another thought. Maxwell added the displacement current to Ampère's Law to make it consistent with electromagnetic waves. But that's not about monopoles. So in this scenario, which equations would be different? The equation for the divergence of B would change. Also, what about the equation for the curl of E? Because if magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps there's a time-varying magnetic charge that would affect the electric fields.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The four equations are:

1. div E = rho / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0 (in our universe)
3. curl E = - dB/dt
4. curl H = J + dD/dt

If magnetic monopoles exist, equation 2 would have div B = rho_m / something, where rho_m is magnetic charge density. So equation 2 changes.

But also, equation 3 might change. Because in our universe, the curl of E is related to the time derivative of B. If there are magnetic charges, I think there might be a term in another equation. Wait, perhaps in the presence of magnetic charges, the curl of E would have a term involving the current density of magnetic charges. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, in the standard equations, the absence of magnetic monopoles allows us to say that the divergence of B is zero. But if monopoles exist, then we can't have that. So equation 2 would change. What about equation 3, Faraday's Law? Faraday's Law says that the curl of E is minus the time derivative of B. But if there are magnetic currents, maybe another term is added.

Wait, let me think. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, you'd have to modify two of Maxwell's equations. Because the symmetry between electric and magnetic fields would require
