Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the setup is a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of this cavity is separated by a distance s from the center of the conductor. The radius of the cavity is r, and r is less than R. Now, a small positive charge +q is placed inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor. The distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta. So, the point P is outside the conductor, but the charge is inside the cavity inside the conductor.

Wait, the conductor is uncharged. But when a charge is placed inside the cavity, how does that affect things? I remember that in electrostatics, the charges inside a conductor's cavity influence the conductor's charges. But wait, the conductor is initially uncharged. So when we put +q in the cavity, the conductor will redistribute its charges in response.

I think that the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity) will have an induced charge. Since the conductor was neutral, the inner surface will have an induced charge of -q to cancel the electric field inside the conductor. But wait, no, because the conductor is a conductor. So, the inner surface must have a charge such that the electric field within the conductor material is zero.

Wait, the conductor is neutral, so when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) must induce a charge of -q. This is because the charge +q inside the cavity creates an electric field, and the conductor's free electrons will move to the inner surface to cancel the field within the conductor's material. So the inner surface of the conductor has -q. But since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q to balance. Because total charge on the conductor was zero, the inner is -q, so the outer must be +q.

Wait, but wait: the conductor was uncharged. So initially, conductor has zero net charge. When +
