Okay, so I've got this question about metric spaces and pseudospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a metric ds², which is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) times (dx² + dy²). And the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. The options are A to D, with D being infinity.

Wait, first things first, what's a pseudosphere? Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. It's like a saddle shape, right? But in higher dimensions, I guess it's represented by certain metrics.

Now, looking at the metric given. It seems to be in two dimensions because there are dx² and dy² terms. The general form for a metric in 2D can be written as ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). So in this case, the function g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²).

Wait, I'm thinking about the line element. That would imply that the metric is conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric. Conformal metrics are like scaling the usual metric by a function, so they have the form λ²(dx² + dy²), which this is, with λ² being 32/(4 - x² - y²).

So for a pseudosphere, which is a surface with constant negative curvature, I remember that the metric can be written in terms of a parameter. Let me recall the metric for a pseudosphere. Oh right, the metric for a pseudosphere (or a hyperbolic space) in Poincaré coordinates is usually something like ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y² - a²), where a is related to the curvature. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I think the standard metric for 2D hyperbolic space is ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 + (r²)/(4a²)))² dθ², but that's in polar coordinates. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, the metric might resemble a Riemannian metric with Gaussian curvature. The given metric has g = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me compute the curvature of this metric to see if it's negative.

The formula for the Gaussian curvature K of a metric ds² = λ²(dx² + dy²) is K = - (1/(2λ)) * (1/(2)) * ∇²(ln λ²), but wait, maybe I should remember the formula correctly. Alternatively, I think the Gaussian curvature for a metric λ²(dx² + dy²) is given by K = - (1/(4λ²)) [ 2(∂²λ/∂x² + ∂²λ/∂y²) ].

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for 2D metrics. The Gaussian curvature K is given by the determinant of the Ricci tensor divided by the metric determinant, but perhaps it's easier to use a known formula for conformal metrics.

Wait, for a metric ds² = f(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 f)) * [ (f_x)_x +
