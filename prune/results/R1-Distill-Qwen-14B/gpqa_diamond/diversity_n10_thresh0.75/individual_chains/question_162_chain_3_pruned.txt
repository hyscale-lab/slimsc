Okay, so I've got this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, so let me think through it step by step.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, it seems like it's a two-dimensional metric because I see dx² and dy². So maybe this is a 2D spacetime, or perhaps part of a higher-dimensional space?

Wait, pseudosphere... I think a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. Like, in hyperbolic geometry. So its geometry is different from a regular sphere. But I'm not exactly sure how that connects to the metric here.

To find the area of the pseudosphere, I probably need to compute the area using the given metric. Generally, the area element in 2D is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, no, in the metric provided, it's written in a form that might already be giving the area element.

Wait, the metric is in the form ds² = A (dx² + dy²), where A is some function. So this looks like it's conformally flat because it's a scalar multiple of the flat metric. For conformally flat metrics, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, but since the metric is diagonal and the off-diagonal terms are zero, the determinant g is just the product of the coefficients of dx² and dy². But wait, in this case, both coefficients are the same, right? Because it's 32/(4 - x² - y²) times (dx² + dy²), so the metric tensor is diag[A, A], where A is that 32/(4 - x² - y²) term.

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. The determinant of a 2x2 diagonal matrix with both elements A is A². So sqrt(A²) is A, right? So dA = A dx dy. So dA = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

But wait, to find the area, I need to integrate this over the region where the metric is defined. What's the domain of x and y? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and since it's in the denominator, that term must not be zero. So 4 - x² - y² ≠ 0 → x² + y² ≠4. So the region is all points where x² + y² <4, meaning inside a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Because if x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, and the metric blows up. So the domain is a disk of radius 2.

So the area would be the integral of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy over the region x² + y² <4.

Wait, but how do I compute this integral? It looks like a standard integral, perhaps using polar coordinates. Let's switch to polar coordinates because the region is a circle and the integrand is radially symmetric.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ
