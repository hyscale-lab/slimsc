Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, the charges redistribute in a certain way.

The problem states that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... I think it's related to the work done to bring charges together. Since one of them is a conducting sphere, which is a conductor, the charges on it will reside on the surface.

Oh right, a grounded conductor means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, so any excess charge will flow to the ground. But wait, if a charge q is placed near it, doesn't that induce charges on the sphere? Because the conductor will have induced charges opposite to q on the near side and same as q on the far side. But wait, no, wait—grounded, so maybe the induced charges can flow away. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, whether it's grounded or not matters. If it's not grounded, the induced charges would be on the surface. But if it's grounded, the charges can leave. So the sphere being grounded would have induced charges such that the net charge on the sphere is zero because any induced charges can flow to the ground. So in this case, the sphere remains neutral, but the induced dipole effect might come into play.

Wait, but I'm not quite sure. Let me think again. The conducting sphere is neutral to start with. When a charge q is placed near it, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the closer side if q is positive, or repelled if negative. But since the sphere is grounded, these induced charges can leave the sphere. So the sphere ends up with zero net charge because any induced positive or negative charges can flow to ground. So the sphere remains neutral.

Wait, but then how does the charge q affect the potential energy? The potential energy is the work done to assemble this configuration. Since the sphere is neutral, the potential outside a conducting sphere is the same as that of a point charge at the center. But wait, no, a neutral conducting sphere doesn't produce an external electric field, right?

Wait, but the setup is that the charge q is placed outside the sphere. So the sphere is at a distance d from q. Because the sphere is grounded, any induced charges would adjust so that the sphere remains neutral. So the sphere's induced charges would be such that the sum is zero. So the sphere's induced charges are: on the near side, -q (if q is positive) and the back side, +q, but that would sum to zero. But wait, that's for a dipole approximation. But since the sphere is a conductor, the induced charges would arrange themselves on the surface. But since the sphere is neutral, and q is a point charge outside, the induced charges would be such that the sphere's surface has a dipole-like distribution.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the method of images. In the method of images, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, we can model the induced charges by an image charge inside the sphere. But wait, if the sphere is conducting and grounded, the image charge method applies.

Wait, when the sphere is grounded, the image charge method tells us that the image charge is placed inside the sphere, but because the sphere is neutral, the total image charge must be such that the sphere remains neutral.

Wait, I'm a bit shaky on that. Let me recall. The method of images for a conducting sphere: for a charge q outside the sphere, the image charge is located inside the sphere, at a distance of (R²/d) from the center. The image charge would be q' = - (R²/d) * (q/(d - R)) ) Wait, no, maybe it's q' = - (R²/d) * q / (d - R). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. I think the image charge is q' = - (R^3)/(d² - R²) * q. Or perhaps it's q' = - (R²)/(d² - R²) * q. Hmm, maybe I should think about the formula.

Wait, I think the image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere is given by q' = - (R²)/(d² - R²) * q. Because the sphere is a conductor, and using the method of images, the image charge is inside, but in this case, the sphere is grounded, so the net charge on the sphere is zero. So the image charge would be such that when added to the induced charges, the total remains zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about potential energy. The potential energy between two charges is U = k q1 q2 / r, but in this case, the sphere is neutral, so the induced charges would be such that the net charge is zero. So perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d from the sphere, considering the induced charges.

Alternatively, another approach: the potential energy U of the system is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So when the charge q is placed, the sphere's induced charges will adjust such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Wait, but how does that affect the potential energy? The external charge q will be in the field of the induced charges. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the problem using the concept of capacitance. The system consists of two charges: the point charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is conducting and neutral, perhaps it's better to model it as the charge q and an image charge. Because the sphere is conducting, the induced charges can be replaced by an image charge inside the sphere.

Wait, so if the image charge is q', then the potential energy would be the sum of the energies associated with each charge. But the sphere being grounded would mean that the image charge is such that the sphere remains neutral, so the image charge is q' = - (R^3 / d^2) * q / (d - R)? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the potential due to the charge q and the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. The potential at the location of q due to the sphere would be zero as well, because the sphere's potential is zero. So the potential energy is the work done to bring q from infinity to that point, which is the potential at that point multiplied by q. But if the sphere's potential is zero, then the potential at d would be due to the image charge.

Wait, maybe the potential energy is the work done to assemble the charge q and the image charge. So U = (1/2) * k * (q * q_image) / r, where r is the distance between them. But since the sphere is grounded, the image charge q_image is such that the sphere's potential is zero.

Wait, I think the image charge q' is located at a distance of R²/d from the center of the sphere. The distance between q and q' would be d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. Wait, no, because q is outside, at distance d. The image charge is inside the sphere, so at a distance of R²/d from the center, but in the opposite direction of q. So the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy U would be (1/2) * k * q * q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'. Substituting q' = - (R^2 / d^2) * q. Wait, no—wait, the image charge q' is given by q' = (R^2 / d) * q. No, wait, I think the formula is q' = - (R^3) / (d² - R²) * q. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge is q' = - (R^2 / d) * q.

Wait, I think I need to recall the method of images for a conducting sphere. The image charge q' is inside the sphere, located at a distance of (R²/d) from the center, on the same line as the original charge q. So the image charge is q' = - (R^3)/(d² - R²) * q. Or is it q' = - (R²/d) * q?

Wait, let me think of the formula. The image charge for a point charge outside a conducting sphere of radius R is given by q' = - (R^3)/(d² - R²) * q. So the potential energy U between the original charge q and the image charge q' would be U = (1/2) k (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them.

Now, the distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. So r = (d² - R²)/d.

Putting it together: U = (1/2) * k * q * (-R^3 q / (d² - R^2)) ) / ( (d² - R²)/d )

Simplify that: U = (1/2) * k * (- R^3 q²) / (d² - R²) * (d / (d² - R²)) )

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, q' = - (R^3 q)/(d² - R^2). So q * q' = q * (- R^3 q)/(d² - R^2) ) = - R^3 q² / (d² - R^2).

The distance r between q and q' is d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d. So r = (d² - R²)/d.

Thus, U = (1/2) * k * (q * q') / r = (1/2) * k * [ - R^3 q² / (d² - R^2) ] / [ (d² - R^2)/d ]

Which simplifies to (1/2) * k * (- R^3 q²) / (d² - R^2) * d / (d² - R^2)

Wait, that would be (1/2) * k * (- R^3 d q²) / (d² - R^2)^2.

But looking at the options, none of them have a denominator squared. So perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I should go back. Another approach: the potential energy of the system when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere is the same as the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to a distance d, considering the induced charges. But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the image charge.

Wait, the potential at the point where q is placed is due to the image charge q'. So the potential V is k q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q', which is (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy U is q * V = q * (k q' / r).

But q' is the image charge, which is q' = - (R^3 q)/(d² - R^2).

So U = q * (k * (- R^3 q)/(d² - R^2) ) / ( (d² - R^2)/d )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= k q (- R^3 q) * d / (d² - R^2)^2 )

= - k R^3 d q² / (d² - R^2)^2.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps I've messed up the image charge formula.

Wait, another thought: when the sphere is grounded, the image charge q' is such that the sphere's potential is zero. The potential at the sphere's surface due to q and q' must be zero. So the potentials from q and q' at the surface (radius R) should sum to zero.

The potential due to q at the sphere's surface is k q / (d), and the potential due to q' is k q' / (R), since q' is inside the sphere. So setting them equal and opposite: k q / d = - k q' / R → q' = - R q / d.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the image charge is q' = - (R q) / d.

So now, let's compute the potential energy U between q and q'. The distance between them is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * (q * q') / r.

Substituting q' = - (R q / d), and r = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

U = (1/2) * k * ( q * (- R q/d) ) / ( (d^2 - R^2)/d )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (1/2) * k * (- R q² / d ) * [ d / (d² - R^2) ) ]

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * k * (- R q² ) / (d² - R^2 )

So U = - (1/2) k R q² / (d^2 - R^2 )

Looking at the options, option C is U = -(1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 -R^2 )

Hmm, but what I have is R q² in the numerator. Option C has R^2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the image charge. Let me redo the potential condition.

The potential at the sphere's surface must be zero. The potential due to q is V1 = k q / (d), and the potential due to q' is V2 = k q' / (R). Since the sphere is at zero potential, V1 + V2 =0 → q' = - (R q)/d.

So the image charge is q' = - (R q)/d.

The distance between q and q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy between them is (1/2) k (q * q') / r.

Plugging in q' and r:

U = (1/2) * k * ( q * (- R q/d) ) / ( (d² - R^2)/d )

= (1/2) * k * (- R q² / d ) * ( d / (d² - R^2) )

= (1/2) * k * (- R q² ) / (d² - R^2 )

So U = - (1/2) (k R q² ) / (d² - R² )

Looking at the options, none match exactly. Wait, the options list option C as U= -(1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

Hmm, so where did I go wrong? Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the image charge formula. Another approach: the potential energy U of the system is the work done to bring the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. Since the sphere is neutral, the image charge is q' = - (R^3 q)/(d^2 - R^2). Let me try this again.

q' = - (R^3 q) / (d^2 - R^2 )

Distance between q and q' is r = d - (R^2/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So U = (1/2) k (q * q') / r.

Substitute q' and r:

U = (1/2) k [ q * (- R^3 q)/(d^2 - R^2) ) ] / ( (d^2 - R^2)/d )

Simplify:

= (1/2) k * (- R^3 q²) / (d^2 - R^2) ) * d / (d^2 - R^2 )

= (1/2) k * (- R^3 d q²) / (d^2 - R^2)^2 )

Hmm, but even this doesn't match any of the options. I must be missing something. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: U = - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2 )

Option B: U= -k q² d/(d^2 - R^2 )

Option C: U= - (1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Option D: U= - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Wait, in my second calculation, I got U = - (1/2) k R q^2 / (d² - R² )

Which is different from option C, which has R squared in the numerator. So maybe I made a mistake in the image charge.

Another approach: perhaps the potential energy is half the product of the charge and the potential it's placed in. So U = q * V, where V is the potential at point d due to the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero. So V at d is due to the image charge q'.

Wait, but if the sphere is at zero potential, the potential at d is the potential due to the image charge q' plus any other contributions. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2) q V, where V is the potential at that point due to all other charges. But since the sphere is grounded, the other charges are the image charge.

So V = k q' / r, where r is the distance from q' to the point d. Wait, q' is inside the sphere, so the distance from q' to d is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So V = k q' / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= k q' d / (d² - R² )

But since the sphere is at zero potential, the sum of the potentials from q and q' at the sphere's surface must be zero. So k q / R + k q' / R = 0.

Wait, no, the sphere's surface is at radius R, so the potential due to q at the surface is k q / (d), and the potential due to q' is k q' / (R) because q' is inside. So the sum must be zero: k q/d + k q' / R = 0 → q' = - (R q)/d.

So, V at point d is the potential due to q' only, which is V = k q' / (distance between q and q').

Wait, the distance between q and q' is (d² - R²)/d. So:

V = k q' / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= k (- R q/d ) * (d)/(d² - R² )

= -k R q / (d² - R² )

So potential energy U is q * V = q * (-k R q ) / (d² - R² )

= - k R q² / (d² - R^2 )

Wait, but that's the same as (1/2) times what I had earlier. Or wait, no, earlier I had (1/2) factor but now it's missing. Why?

Because when calculating potential energy, it's (1/2) q V, perhaps. Because the energy is the work done to bring the charge q into the potential V created by other charges. Since the sphere's induced charges are considered as image charge, the potential at d is due to the image charge. So U = q * V.

But wait, no, the image charge method accounts for the energy as (1/2) k (q * q')/r, where q' is the image charge. So perhaps that approach is correct.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the system's potential energy. The potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs. So in this case, it's the energy due to q and the induced charges on the sphere. The induced charges can be modeled as a single image charge q'. So the potential energy is (1/2) * k * (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between them.

So using q' = - (R q)/d, and r = (d² - R²)/d.

U = (1/2) * k * [ q * (- R q/d) ] / ( (d² - R²)/d )

= (1/2) * k * (- R q² / d ) * (d / (d² - R^2) )

= (1/2) * k * (- R q² ) / (d² - R^2 )

So U = - (1/2) (k R q²) / (d² - R^2 )

Looking at the options, none of them match exactly. But wait, option C is U = -(1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Hmm, so my result has R in the numerator, but option C has R squared. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the image charge.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is q' = - (R^2 q)/(d^2 - R^2)

Wait, let me think again. The image charge formula for a sphere of radius R is given by q' = (R^3 q) / (d^2 - R^2), but with a negative sign because it's inside the sphere.

Wait, another source I remember says that for a point charge q outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge is q' = - (R^3 q)/(d² - R^2 ), where d is the distance between the charge and the center.

So let's use that: q' = - (R^3 q)/(d² - R^2 )

Then, the distance r between q and q' is d - (R^2 / d ) = (d² - R^2)/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * (q * q') / r.

Substituting:

U = (1/2) * k * [ q * (- R^3 q)/(d² - R^2 ) ] / [ (d² - R^2)/d ]

= (1/2) * k * ( - R^3 q² )/(d² - R^2 ) * d/(d² - R^2 )

= (1/2) * k * (- R^3 d q² ) / (d² - R^2 )^2

Hmm, this gives U = - (1/2) k R^3 d q²/(d² - R^2 )^2, which also doesn't match any options.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different angle. Another approach is to consider the potential energy as the work done to assemble the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere.

Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charges on the sphere will be such that the net charge is zero. The potential energy U can be found by considering the energy stored in the configuration.

The potential energy of the system is the potential energy of the charge q in the field of the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, its potential is zero, so the potential at point d is solely due to the induced charges.

But calculating this potential might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the potential energy between two charges, treating the sphere's induced charge as a point charge at the center.

Wait, but the sphere is conducting, so the external field outside is as if all the charge were at the center. However, since the sphere is neutral, the induced charge on it due to q is such that the sphere's net charge is zero.

Wait, but if the sphere is neutral, then the induced charge must be zero. That can't be right. Oh, wait, the induced charges are not zero; they are such that the sphere's net charge remains zero. So perhaps the sphere's induced charges are -q on the near side and +q on the far side, but that can't be because that would sum to zero. But that's not how induction works. The induced charges would be such that the sphere's net charge remains zero, but the distribution is such that the potential on the surface is zero.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach. Maybe think about the capacitance of the sphere.

The sphere, when isolated, has a capacitance C = 4 π ε₀ R. But when it's grounded, its potential is zero. But when a charge q is placed near it, the induced charges create a dipole field. But perhaps the potential energy is related to the dipole moment.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the system as two charges: q and its image, but I'm not confident.

Wait, going back to the image charge approach, if the image charge is q' = - (R^3 q)/(d² - R^2 ), then the potential energy U is (1/2) k (q q') / r, where r is the distance between them.

r = d - (R^2 /d ) = (d² - R^2 )/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * [ q * (- R^3 q)/(d² - R^2) ) ] / [ (d² - R^2 )/d ]

= (1/2) * k * ( - R^3 q^2 ) * d / (d² - R^2 )^2

= - (1/2) k R^3 d q² / (d² - R^2 )^2.

But the options don't have this form. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge formula. Let me verify the image charge formula for a conducting sphere. I think the image charge for a point charge q outside a conducting sphere of radius R is given by q' = - (R^3 q)/(d² - R^2 ), where d is the distance between the charge and the center.

So yes, that's correct. So the calculation stands, but none of the options match.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A) U = -(1/2) k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2 )

Option B) U= -k q^2 d/(d^2 - R^2 )

Option C) U= -(1/2) k q^2 R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Option D) U= -(1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to think in terms of the energy stored in the electric fields. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: the potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away from the sphere. The presence of the sphere affects this work, as the sphere induces charges which create an electric field opposing the approach.

But since the sphere is grounded, perhaps the potential on the sphere is zero, so the potential at the location of q is the potential due to all other charges, which in this case is the image charge.

So U = q * (potential at d due to image charge).

The potential due to the image charge q' at point d is V = k q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

So r = (d^2 - R^2 )/d.

So V = k q' * (d)/(d^2 - R^2 )

But q' is - (R^3 q)/(d^2 - R^2 )

So V = k * [ - (R^3 q)/(d^2 - R^2 ) ] * [ d/(d^2 - R^2 ) ]

= - k R^3 q d / (d^2 - R^2 )^2.

Thus, U = q * V = q * [ - k R^3 q d / (d^2 - R^2 )^2 ]

= - k R^3 q^2 d / (d^2 - R^2 )^2.

Again, same as before, but not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge formula. Another source says that for a point charge outside a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge is given by q' = - (R^3 q ) / (d² - R² ), where d is the distance from the charge to the center. So that part seems correct.

But maybe the potential energy isn't calculated between q and the image charge, but considering the work done to bring q into the field created by the sphere's induced charges. So perhaps another approach is needed.

Another approach: the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each charge. Since the sphere is neutral, the only charge is q. But the sphere's induced charges create a potential at q's location.

Wait, but that's similar to what I did earlier. So perhaps I should accept that none of the options match, but that can't be right because the options are given. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct image charge is q' = - (R q)/(d). So the potential energy would be (1/2) k (q * q') / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

r = d - (R²/d) = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So U = (1/2) * k * (q * (- R q/d )) / ( (d^2 - R^2)/d )

= (1/2) * k * (- R q^2 /d ) * (d/(d^2 - R^2 ) )

= (1/2) * k * (- R q^2 )/(d^2 - R^2 )

So U = - (1/2) k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Looking at the options again, this matches option D, which has U = -(1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

But in my earlier step, using the correct image charge formula, I got a different answer. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the potential energy when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere is indeed given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 ). So that would point to option D.

But wait in my earlier calculation using q' = - R q/d, the potential energy became U = - (1/2) k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Which is option D.

So perhaps I was overcomplicating and the correct answer is option C, but that's not matching.

Wait, I'm getting confused because I'm getting two different answers depending on which image charge formula I use. But perhaps the correct image charge formula is q' = - (R^2 q)/d^2. Hmm, no, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps I should check the image charge formula again. The image charge for a conducting sphere can be found by requiring that the potential on the surface of the sphere is zero. The potential due to q and q' at the sphere's surface must cancel each other.

So potential from q at the sphere's surface: V1 = k q / d.

Potential from q' at the sphere's surface: V2 = k q' / R.

Setting V1 + V2 = 0 → q' = - (R q)/d.

So the image charge is indeed q' = - (R q)/d.

So then, the potential energy U between q and q' is U = (1/2) k ( q * q' ) / r, where r is the distance between them.

Distance r between q and q' is d - (R^2/d ) = (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So U = (1/2) k * [ q * (- R q/d) ] / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ]

= (1/2) k * (- R q^2 / d ) * [ d/(d^2 - R^2) ]

= (1/2) k * (- R q^2 )/(d^2 - R^2 )

Which gives U = - (1/2) k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

So looking at the options, option D is U = -(1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the image charge should be q' = - (R^3 q)/(d^2 - R^2 ), but that leads to a different result, which doesn't match any options. So perhaps the mistake was in that image charge formula. Maybe when the sphere is grounded, the image charge is q' = - (R^2 q)/d^2, but that's not matching either.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the image charge is q' = - (R q)/d.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm getting option D. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is the work done to bring the charge into the potential created by the sphere. So if the sphere's potential at point d is V, then U = q * V.

But what is V?

The sphere's surface is at zero potential. The potential at point d due to the sphere's induced charges can be found. However, the sphere's induced charges are such that the potential at its surface is zero. So the potential at d is due to the image charge q'.

V = k q' / (distance between q and q').

Which is V = k (- R q/d ) / ( (d^2 - R^2)/d )

= - k R q / (d^2 - R^2 )

So U = q * V = q * (-k R q )/(d^2 - R^2 )

= - k R q^2 / (d^2 - R^2 )

But this isn't matching any options either. Hmm.

Wait, but if I factor in that the potential energy is (1/2) q V, maybe that's where the 1/2 factor comes from.

So U = (1/2) q V = (1/2) * q * (-k R q)/(d^2 - R^2 )

= - (1/2) k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Which is the same as option D.

So I think the correct answer is option D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the induced charges on the grounded conducting sphere. The sphere is neutral, and the induced charges can be modeled using the method of images. The image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere is determined by the condition that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

### Key Steps:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) is located inside the sphere at a distance \( R^2/d \) from the center, where \( R \) is the radius of the sphere and \( d \) is the distance between the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The image charge is given by:  
   \[
   q' = -\frac{R q}{d}.
   \]

2. **Distance Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The distance \( r \) between \( q \) and \( q' \) is:  
   \[
   r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]

3. **Potential Energy Calculation**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) of the system is the work done to bring \( q \) from infinity to the point \( d \), considering the interaction with the image charge \( q' \). Using the formula for the potential energy between two charges:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \cdot q'}{r}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R q}{d} \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \):  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} k \frac{q \cdot \left(-\frac{R q}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   The derived expression matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The net potential energy of the system is given by **Option D**.
