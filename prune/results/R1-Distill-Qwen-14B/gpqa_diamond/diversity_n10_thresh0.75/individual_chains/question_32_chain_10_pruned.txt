Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and here the nucleus is lithium with 3 neutrons, so I think that must be Li-6 or Li-7? Wait, wait, Li usually has 3 protons. If it's 3 neutrons, then Li-6 has 3 neutrons (3 protons +3 neutrons=6 nucleons), right? So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is asking for the energy of the RHIC such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So I need to calculate the relativistic energy of this nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light.

I recall that relativistic energy is given by the equation E = gamma * m * c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

First, let's compute gamma. v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.09) is 0.3, sqrt(0.04) is 0.2, so 0.0784 is between 0.09 and 0.04. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.0784 is 784e-4, which is 28^2 * 4e-4. Wait, 28^2 is 784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 is 28/100. So 1/0.28 is 100/28, which is 25/7. 25 divided by 7 is about 3.5714. Right.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Next, I need the mass of the Li nucleus. Li-6 has 6 nucleons: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a nucleon is approximately 1 GeV/c². Wait, wait, wait. I think that 1 atomic mass unit (u) is about 0.9315 GeV/c². So each nucleon (proton or neutron) is roughly 0.9315 GeV/c². So Li-6 would have a mass of approximately 6 * 0.9315 GeV/c².

Wait, but wait. Is that accurate? Because the mass of a nucleus is not exactly the sum of the masses of its nucleons due to binding energy. But in high-energy physics, they often use the mass as the sum
