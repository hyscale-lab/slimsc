Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The problem is about a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4.

The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to figure out what each reaction is doing.

1. The first reaction: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature.

Wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile and can induce elimination reactions, especially when there are good leaving groups. The dibromomethyl groups have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. So, perhaps the initial compound undergoes some substitution or elimination.

Wait, the starting material has a bicyclo structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7, which is the bridgehead. So, the molecule is 7-O-t-Bu-norbornadiene.

The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Each of the dibromomethyl groups has two bromines on adjacent carbons. So, when sodium iodide is present, which is a source of iodide ions, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups undergo elimination. Because when two adjacent bromines are present, under such conditions, elimination can occur, forming a double bond. But wait, in this case, each dibromomethyl is on a cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the starting material is a diene, and the addition of two equivalents might lead to some conjugate addition or perhaps a Diels-Alder reaction?

Alternatively, perhaps the iodide is acting as a nucleophile, displacing the bromine. Wait, but each dibromomethyl group has two Br atoms. If each acts as a leaving group, maybe a substitution occurs, but with two substituents, perhaps each of the two dibromomethyl groups loses a Br.

Wait, but sodium iodide (NaI) is a source of I- which is a good nucleophile. So in the presence of a di- or polyhalide, like a dibromomethyl group, the I- can displace the Br in an SN2 reaction. But wait, each of the dibromomethyl
