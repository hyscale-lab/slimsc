Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The question talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. 

Another clue is that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, I'm thinking about what reagents are commonly used in organic chemistry. Maybe something like Grignard reagents? Or maybe something else like a strong base or a reducing agent.

Wait, Grignard reagents are Mg-based, right? They react with carbonyl groups. But let's think about the reaction with liquid Y. The reaction is violent, so maybe it's a strong acid or base. If X is a metal, like Mg, reacting with an acid could produce hydrogen gas.

Let's think about the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for a molecule, each atom contributes to the total. Wait, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let me take an example. If W is H2O, then protons would be 2, neutrons would be 10 (since O has 8 protons, so 8 neutrons? Wait, H2O has 2 H and 1 O. So total protons would be 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8, so 8. So 10 protons vs 8 neutrons. Not the same. So that doesn't fit.

What about NH3? No, because it's a molecule with 14 protons (N has 7, each H 1; 7 + 3 = 10) and neutrons. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of a molecule where the total protons equals total neutrons. Let's take an example: CO2. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen 8. So CO2 has 6 + 16 = 22 protons. Neutrons: Carbon has 6, so 6 neutrons? No, wait, CO2 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons) and two O atoms (each with 8 protons, 8 neutrons). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh wait! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. That fits the description.

So gas W is CO2. Or wait, another possibility: maybe CH4? No, CH4 has 6 protons (C) +4 (H)=10, and 6 neutrons in C plus 0 in H, so 6. Doesn't match. What about O3? O has 8 protons each. O3 has 24 protons, 16 neutrons (each O has 8 neutrons, 3 O's=24). 24 vs 24. So O3 would have 24 protons and 24 neutrons. So that works too. Alternatively, maybe a molecule with 10 protons and 10 neutrons? Let's see: like NO. Nitrogen (7 protons) + O (8) =15 protons. Neutrons: N has 7 (since N-14 is common), O has 8. So 7+8=15. So
