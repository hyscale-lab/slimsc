Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stumped. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a reaction involving Substance X. It says that X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of neutrons and protons... Wait, that means the molecule is probably H2O or something else where the atoms have equal numbers. Oh wait, no, if each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's CO or something. Wait, no, let me think again. For each molecule, the sum of protons and neutrons should be equal per atom? Or per molecule as a whole?

Wait, the problem says "the same number of neutrons and protons" in the molecule. So for each molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total number of protons. So for example, H2O has H (1 proton, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons?), wait no, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons typically. So in H2O, total protons would be 2 + 8 =10, neutrons 0 +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Maybe it's something like CO2. C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (carbon-12), O has 8 each. In CO2, each molecule has 6
