Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think through what each part means.

The problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, okay. So the setup is that we have a central charge fixed at point P, and 12 other charges each located at a distance of 2 meters away from P. Since all charges are the same, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when charges are placed in an electric field, they have potential energy, and we need to find the total potential energy of the system.

Wait, but wait. Because all the 12 charges are identical and placed symmetrically around the central charge, the potential due to each of them at point P would be the same, right? So the potential energy would be the sum of the interactions between each charge and the central one, plus the interactions between the 12 charges themselves. Oh wait, but wait a minute. The 12 charges are fixed at 2 m from P, but they are not fixed relative to each other. So they can move, but constrained to stay at 2m from P. Hmm. So, are they arranged in a way that each is 2m from P but their positions relative to each other can vary? Or are they all at the same point?

No, probably they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2m around P, but their exact positions can vary as long as they stay on that sphere. So the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves would depend on their configuration. But wait, the problem asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the potential energy is minimized, meaning the charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual repulsion is minimized.

Wait, but the system is isolated, so maybe the potential energy is being considered only between the charges. Let me think. Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and the fixed charge at P is also 2e. So each of these 12 charges will
