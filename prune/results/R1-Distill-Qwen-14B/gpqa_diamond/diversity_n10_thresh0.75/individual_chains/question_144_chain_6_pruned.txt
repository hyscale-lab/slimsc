Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in units of meters, so I'll need to calculate it and then compare.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its velocity. The formula I think is something like L = v * τ * c, where v is the particle's velocity, τ is the mean lifetime, and c is the speed of light. Right?

But first, how do I find the lifetime τ? Oh yes, from the decay width Γ. The relation between Γ and τ is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, in natural units where ħ = 1 (GeV·s), Γ is in GeV, so τ would be in seconds. But I need to calculate it correctly.

Let me write down the steps:

1. Calculate the particle's lifetime τ.
2. Find the velocity v of the particle.
3. Multiply τ by v and the speed of light to get the decay length.

Wait, actually, the formula might be L = (v * β) * c * τ, where β is v/c. Hmm, I think I might have gotten that mixed up. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the mean proper lifetime, then multiply by velocity and speed of light. Let me be careful.

First, compute the lifetime τ. The width Γ is given as 320 MeV, but I should convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

The lifetime τ = ħ / Γ. But since ħ c is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm, but maybe I should just use the relation in natural units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV^-1 s GeV / Γ. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the formula τ = ħ / Γ. So in units where ħ is 6.582 × 10
