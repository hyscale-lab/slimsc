Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of two planets compare based on the shifts in their spectral lines. Alright, let's break it down.

So the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.

The radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. When the star moves toward us, the spectral lines shift blue (shorter wavelength), and when it moves away, they shift red (longer wavelength). The periodic shift indicates the planet's presence.

Planet #1 has a spectral line shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7 milliangstroms. The question is, how many times longer is Planet #2's orbital period than Planet #1's?

Wait, I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) depends on several factors. The formula for K is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P * (2π)^(1/3)) ) ), but maybe I'm mixing up some parts.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler approach is to think about the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period. I recall that the observed velocity semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around... I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Wait, actually, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, we can approximate this as K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) / (c P)^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / (M_*^(2/3) ) )

So, K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), assuming all other factors are equal.

But in this problem, both stars have the same mass (like the Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like). The only difference given is the semi-amplitude K. So, K1 is 5 miliangstroms and K2 is 7. I think the key here is that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. So if K1 is smaller than K2, that would mean that P1 is larger than P2, wait no, because K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3), so higher K would mean shorter P. Because if K increases, P decreases.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say K ∝ 1/P^(1/3). So, if K doubles, P^(1/3) halves, so P is 1/8th. So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. So, in this problem, Planet #1 has a smaller K (5) compared to Planet #2 (7). So K2 > K1, which implies P2 < P1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter than planet 1. But the question is, how much longer is P2 than P1? Wait, no, the question is how many times is P2 longer than P1? Wait, if P2 is shorter, then the factor would be less than 1.

Wait, let's think with numbers. Let's say P2 is x times P1. The question is, what is x? Let's see.

Given that K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1 = (some constant) / (P1)^(1/3)
Similarly, K2 = (same constant) / (
