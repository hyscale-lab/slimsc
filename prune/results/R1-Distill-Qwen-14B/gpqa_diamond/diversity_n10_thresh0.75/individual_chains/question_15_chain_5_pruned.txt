Okay, so I've got this question here about transiting planets and which one is more likely to transit. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose which one to observe because they have limited time and want the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Both planets have the same mass. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1's period is P1, Planet_2's is P2 = 3 P1.

They have circular orbits, which I think matters because eccentricity affects transit probability, but since both are circular, maybe that's not a factor here.

The host stars are different. The star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm. So, M1 = 2 M2, R1 = R2.

Wait, the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but both have the same radii. So, the host of Planet_1 is more massive but not larger.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. Oh wait, the transit probability formula, right. I think the probability P is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by something else. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / a) where a is the semi-major axis, but scaled somehow.

Wait, the transit probability depends on the alignment of the orbit with our line of sight. The main factor is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So, the formula I remember is something like P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - e²)^0.5) ), but since e is zero here, it's just (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by (something about the orbital plane).

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Oh right, the geometric probability that the planet's orbit as seen from Earth causes a transit. So the probability is (R_* + R_p) / a, but wait, no, I think the formula is (R_*/a) where R_* is the star's radius and a
