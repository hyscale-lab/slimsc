Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing A and B with different reagents.

Hmm, I remember that in organic chemistry, especially with ketones and nitriles, certain reagents are used in specific reactions. Let me break this down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone) plus NaCN and A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide source like NaCN, what happens? I think this is an example of a nucleophilic addition. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the reaction can go through different mechanisms.

Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. When NaCN is added, it might perform a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon. But wait,
