Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about identifying the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile, often used in nucleophilic addition reactions with ketones. So the first reaction probably involves a ketone reacting with cyanide ions. But wait, ketones typically react with nucleophiles in a nucleophilic addition. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? When it reacts with NaCN, where does the CN- attack?

In the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, the structure would be (CH3)C(OH)(CN)CH2 something? Wait, maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps the OH is on the same carbon as the CN. Let me think. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. When it reacts with CN-, the nucleophilic attack would happen on the carbonyl carbon.

So the product would have an OH group where the carbonyl was. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding HCN to it via the electrophilic carbonyl. After the addition, the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that would be 3-hydroxy-3-methylbutanenitrile? Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3? No, because butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on the end. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the carbons. Let me draw it out.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but substituents can change that. But the product
