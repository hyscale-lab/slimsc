Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know.

The Mott-Gurney equation is related to the current in a semiconductor device, specifically in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. From what I remember, this regime occurs when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the electric field is so strong that it repels the charge carriers, creating a region where the density of carriers is so high that it affects the overall electric field. 

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). Let me parse the variables: ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the voltage, and L is the length of the device. So J is proportional to V squared, which makes sense because in SCLC, the current usually has a quadratic dependence on voltage.

Now, the question is about the validity conditions of this equation. The options are A, B, C, D, each describing different setups. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

Hmm, I think the Mott-Gurney equation applies to a specific kind of device. Let me think about the assumptions behind the equation.

I remember that the derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation makes several key assumptions. One is that the device is single-carrier, meaning it's either electrons or holes, not both. Because if it's a two-carrier device, like a p-n junction, the behavior would be different, maybe more like the Shockley equation. So options C and D can be ruled out because they mention two-carrier devices.

Another assumption is that the contacts are Ohmic. That is, the device doesn't have any significant barrier for the carriers to cross the contacts. If there's a Schottky contact, which has a barrier, that might complicate things. So I think the equation holds for Ohmic contacts, not Schottky. So looking at the options, option C says Schottky contact; that's probably not correct.

What about traps? The equation assumes a trap-free region. Traps would mean that carriers are getting stuck, which complicates the current flow. So if there are traps, the Mott-Gurney equation might not hold. Let me see the options again.

Option A says 'trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current.' Wait, negligible drift current? That doesn't sound right. Because in the SCLC regime, drift is the main mechanism. If drift is negligible, then maybe it's a different regime, like diffusion current dominant. So, A might be incorrect because it says negligible drift current.

Option B says trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier (so Ohmic, perhaps), and negligible diffusion current. Wait, the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the space charge is such that the electric field is strong enough that the space-charge region is dominant, so drift is more important than diffusion. So if diffusion is negligible, that fits the SCLC scenario. But wait, in the derivation, do they consider drift or diffusion?

In the SCLC model, I think the current is dominated by the drift of carriers, and the electric field is set up by the space charge. So in that case, diffusion is not the main factor, meaning diffusion current is negligible. Therefore, the assumption of negligible diffusion current would be correct.

So looking again at option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic), and negligible diffusion current. That sounds right.

Option A's mention of negligible drift is conflicting because the SCLC relies on drift. So A is probably wrong.

So the correct statement is option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the charge carrier mobility, and \( L \) is the length of the device. The validity of this equation depends on several assumptions:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, where the current is dominated by either electrons or holes, not both. This rules out two-carrier devices, such as p-n junctions, which are described by different equations (e.g., the Shockley equation). Thus, options C and D can be eliminated.

2. **Trap-free region**: The equation assumes that the device is trap-free, meaning there are no impurities or defects that can trap charge carriers. If traps are present, the current flow would be disrupted, and the Mott-Gurney equation would not hold.

3. **Ohmic contacts**: The equation assumes Ohmic contacts, where there is no significant barrier to carrier injection. If the device has Schottky contacts, which introduce a barrier, the current behavior would deviate from the Mott-Gurney prediction. This eliminates option C.

4. **Negligible diffusion current**: In the SCLC regime, the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. The electric field created by the space charge ensures that drift is the primary mechanism. Therefore, the assumption of negligible diffusion current is valid, as stated in option B.

5. **Drift current**: The Mott-Gurney equation relies on the dominance of drift current in the SCLC regime. If drift current were negligible, the equation would not apply, ruling out option A.

Based on these considerations, the correct statement is that the Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current.
