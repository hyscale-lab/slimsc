Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here.

So the setup is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a construct that overexpresses the GADD45G gene. To tag the protein, they've introduced a sequence for an influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected this plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance. But when they test the expression, they can't overexpress the protein as expected.

The problem is that their construct isn't working. They look at the plus strand sequence, and I need to figure out why they can't express the protein.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA tag. So the HA tag's sequence is wrong, leading to a nonfunctional tag. But wait, the HA is a peptide epitope for detection, but if it's a missense, maybe the antibody won't recognize it. But the main issue here is the protein isn't being overexpressed. So this might not be the main reason. Unless the HA tag is causing some problem, like incorrect folding or recognition by the cell's machinery.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If the plus strand has a stop codon, maybe the mRNA has a UAA, UAG, or UGA. Let's look at the sequence.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. If there's no linker, maybe the HA tag is causing the protein to be recognized by proteases. So the protein gets degraded before it can be detected. But then why isn't it expressed at all? Or perhaps the cells are producing the protein, but it's being broken down, so the expression level is low. But the question says they observe no overexpression, so maybe they can't detect it because it's being cut.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the mouse doesn't have a tRNA for UAA, that would mean the ribosome can't read through it. So if the mRNA has a UAA somewhere, the ribosome would stop. But wait, the plasmid is in the mouse, so the cells are CHO cells, which are mammalian. Mammalian cells have the standard tRNAs. So any UAA would be a stop. Unless it's a nonsense-mediated decay situation, but that's more about mRNA stability.

Looking at the given DNA sequence. The plus strand is provided. Let me translate part of it to see if there's a premature stop codon.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons.

Wait, the sequence is in the plus strand, so the coding (sense) strand. The mRNA would be complementary to this. Let's think: the plasmid's plus strand is the same as the mRNA except T for U. So the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand, except Us instead of Ts.

So looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA codons in the DNA's plus strand because that would be the complementary to mRNA's UAA, UAG, UGA.

Wait, no. Wait, the DNA is double-stranded. The coding sequence is on the plus strand, so the mRNA is synthesized from the complementary (minus) strand. So the mRNA's sequence is complementary to the plus strand. So for the mRNA, the sequence would be the same as the DNA's minus strand.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

DNA is double-stranded. The plus strand is the same as mRNA in terms of sequence (except T for U). So the coding strand is the plus strand because it's the same as the mRNA. Therefore, the mRNA is synthesized as a copy
