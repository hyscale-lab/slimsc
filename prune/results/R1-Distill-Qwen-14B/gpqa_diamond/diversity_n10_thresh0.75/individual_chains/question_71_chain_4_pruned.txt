Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. Oh wait, the formula is something like T = T_star * ( ( L_star / (16πσ) ) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ( (1 / (distance)) )^(1/2) )^(1/2). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Oh right, the basic formula for equilibrium temperature is T_eff = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, no, I think that's the effective temperature of the star. For a planet, the equilibrium temperature (T_p) depends on the star's temperature, the planet's distance, and the planet's albedo. The formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's T_p = T_star * ( ( L / (16πσ) ) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) * ( (1/(4π a²)) )^(1/4) ). Hmm, no, perhaps a simpler approach.

Wait, I think the more straightforward formula is T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). Or wait, perhaps it's T_p = ( L_star / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4) multiplied by ( (1 - a) )^(1/4), where L_star is the star's luminosity. Because the star's flux at the planet's distance is L/(4πa²). The planet reflects some of that, so the absorbed power is (L/(4πa²)) * (1 - a) * π r², where r is the planet's radius. But since we're looking for the equilibrium temperature, which is an approximation assuming uniform heat distribution, the formula is T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4).

So, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) * ( L )^(1/4) / a^(1/2). But in this problem, all the planets have the same albedo, so (1 - a) is constant. And since it's the same star for all, L is the same for all planets. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets depends only on their distances.

Wait, but wait, because the question says the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the orbital periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. Since the planets have circular orbits, Kepler's third law applies: P² is proportional to a³. Because P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a³ is proportional to P², which means a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So for Planet 4, P4 = 3.5, which is 7/2. Planet 2 has P2=2. So the ratio of a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3) = ( (3.5)/(2) )^(2/3) = (7/4)^(2/3). Let me compute that. 7/4 is 1.75. 1.75^(2/3) is approximately what? Let me think. Cube
