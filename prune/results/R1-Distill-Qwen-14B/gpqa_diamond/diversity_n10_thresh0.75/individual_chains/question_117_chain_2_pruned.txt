Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism happens when compounds are chiral, right? Chiral means they have no plane of symmetry and are not superimposable on their mirror image. So I need to check each of the four compounds given to see if they can exhibit optical isomerism.

Let's look at each one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' position. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. Wait, are there any stereogenic centers here? The carbons attached to the oxygen in the ester groups would be the ones at positions 2 and 2'. Let me think. If the substituents on each biphenyl ring are in such a way that each ester group is on a carbon that's connected to two different groups. For example, each ester group is attached to the biphenyl ring (which is a bulky group) and has two methyl groups as the ester. Wait, no, wait. The ester is OMe (since it's dimethyl, so both esters are OMe). Each of those ester oxygens is attached to a methyl. So the carbonyl carbons would be connected to two methyl groups and the OMe groups? Or wait, the structure would be OMe-CO-O-C6H4... No, wait, the ester group is OMe attached to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl carbon would be connected to two ester groups? No, wait. The structure is dimethyl, so each ester is OMe. So the structure is something like:

On each biphenyl ring (which are connected at 1,1'), the positions 2 and 2' have COOCH3 groups. And positions 6,6' have nitro groups.

Wait, but wait, each ester is on a benzene ring. So each OMe is attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the ring. Now, the carbons where the ester groups are attachedâ€”if those carbons are chiral centers. So for a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different groups attached.

So the carbonyl group is part of an ester. The ester is OMe attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring. So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is part of the ring. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For biphenyl systems, sometimes the substituents can be arranged symmetrically. If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule is symmetrical, maybe there's no optical isomerism.

Wait, in this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and 6' and ester groups at 2 and 2'. But the biphenyl is 1,1', so the substituents are on adjacent positions across the rings. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. Let me visualize: if substituent positions are 2 and 2', and 6 and 6' on each ring, then
