Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of cobalt is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta values) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) are used to determine the concentration of complexes in solution. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. The complexes here are probably different in terms of how many SCN- ions are attached.

Wait, the question specifically mentions the 'blue dithiocyanato' complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So maybe the complexes are Co(SCN)1, Co(SCN)2, etc.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Let me think about what each β represents. Oh right, the stability constant for a complex with n ligands is βn = [CoL^n]/([Co][L]^n), where L is the ligand. So for Co(SCN)²+, the β1 would correspond to the complex with one SCN, β2 with two, and so on.

Wait, but the problem says β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3 which is 63. That's a bit confusing because usually, higher beta values imply more stable complexes. So maybe the complexes are ordered by their stability? Let me think: the order here would be β3 (63) > β2 (40) > β1 (9) > β4 (16). Wait, but β4 is 16, which is less than β2 and β3 but more than β1. So the most stable is β3, then β2, then β4, then β1? Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the numbering here.

Wait, wait, perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2+
