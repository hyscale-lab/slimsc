Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet, I think. But wait, the question is about the orbital periods, so I need to figure out how the Doppler shifts relate to the orbital period.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune's mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, other factors like star mass and planet mass are the same for both. But the RV shifts are different: 5 milliangstrom for planet #1 and 7 for #2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the RV method detects the star's velocity towards and away from us. The size of the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is what's measured. So, the shift in the spectral lines relates to this velocity. K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet.

But how does K relate to the orbital period? Oh, I remember the formula involving K, the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Let me think. There's this formula that relates K to the planetary mass and the period, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relation.

Wait, the RV method gives K, the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) )) ] * some constant. But wait, since the planet's mass is much less than the star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, which is the same for both stars. So that part cancels out.

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)).

Wait, but in this problem, the planets have similar masses, right? The question says both have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p for both is about the same. So K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So, P ∝ 1 / K^(3).

Wait, let's see. If K1 is for planet 1, K2 is for planet 2, then K1/K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But wait, no. Wait, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)), and since M_p is the same for both, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Because K1 = (M_p) / (P1^(1/3)), K2 = (M_p)/(P2^(1/3)), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let me write it down:

K ∝ (M_p) / (P^(1/3))

So, K1 / K2 = (M_p1 / P1^(1/3)) ) / (M_p2 / P2^(1/3)) )

But M_p1 ≈ M_p2, since both are Neptune-like. So M_p1 / M_p2 ≈1.

Thus, K1/K2 = (P2^(1/3)) / (P1^(1/3)) )

=> (K1/K2) = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3)

We can rearrange this to find P2/P1 = ( K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, let me see. So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^{1/3}

Raise both sides to the 3rd power: (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

So, P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let me double-check. Let me think for a moment. K is inversely proportional to P^{1/3}, so if K increases, P decreases. Because K ∝ 1/P^{1/3} → P ∝ 1/K^{3}.

Wait, no, wait.

If K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)), then P^(1/3) is proportional to M_p / K.

So, P is proportional to (M_p / K )^3.

But since M_p is same for both, P is inversely proportional to K^3.

Wait, so P ∝ 1/K^3.

Thus, P2 / P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3 )

Because P2 = (M_p)^3/(K2^3 * ... ), etc. Wait, perhaps I should consider the exact formula.

The exact formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i ) / (M_star^(2/3) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Since M_p is same for both planets, K1/K2 = 1/(P1^(1/3)) / 1/(P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this to find (P2/P1) = (K1/K2 )^3

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Let me write it step by step.

K1 = (M_p ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

K2 = (M_p ) / ( P2^(1/3) )

Divide K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = [ (M_p ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) ]  /  [ (M_p ) / ( P2^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify, M_p cancels:

K1/K2 = ( P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) ) )

Which is same as:

K1/K2 = ( P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So,

( K1/K2 )^3 = P2 / P1

So,

P2 = P1 * ( K1 / K2 )^3

Wait, that can't be right because if K1 is smaller than K2, then K1/K2 is less than 1, so (something less than 1)^3 is even smaller, so P2 would be smaller than P1. But wait, what do K1 and K2 represent?

In the problem, Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstrom, and Planet #2 has 7. Since K is the semi-amplitude of velocity, a larger K means a larger star velocity. So, the larger K (7) corresponds to which planet? So, K2 is larger than K1.

Wait, the question says: the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for #2 it's 7. So K1 =5, K2=7.

So, K2 > K1.

So, K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Then, (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 ≈ P1 * 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period than planet #1's. So, the ratio is P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364. So, it's about 0.36 times as long, meaning planet #2's period is shorter.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, P2 is 0.36 times longer than P1, so the answer is approximately 0.36 times. So looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't confuse the ratio. Because we had P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

So, P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1.

Which is (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 * P1.

So, P2 is about 0.364 * P1, so how many times longer is P2 than P1? So, P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36 times. So the answer is A) ~0.36.

Wait, but wait another moment. Another approach: since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so P is inversely proportional to K^3.

So, P1 ∝ 1/K1^3, P2 ∝ 1/K2^3.

So, P2/P1 = (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1^3)/(K2^3) ) = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Yes, same result.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV method measures the star's velocity semi-amplitude \( K \), which is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \) for planets with similar masses. This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Since \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

From the problem, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstrom} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstrom} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of planet #1. Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**A) ~0.36**
