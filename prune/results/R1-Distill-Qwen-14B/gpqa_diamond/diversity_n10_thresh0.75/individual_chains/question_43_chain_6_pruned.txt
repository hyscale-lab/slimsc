Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Hmm, so that means each of these groups is positioned three carbons apart. Wait, but wait, meta in a benzene ring is positions 1,3,5 if they're all meta to each other? Or maybe each is meta to the others. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me visualize the benzene ring.

So, the main functional group is the carboxylic acid because it's the suffix in the IUPAC name, so that's position 1. Wait, but wait, in IUPAC naming, the principal functional group is the one with the highest priority. Carboxylic acid has higher priority than aldehyde or nitrile. So the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid.

So, the ring is numbered such that the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the other groups are attached in their respective positions relative to it.

The problem states that the carbaldehyde (formyl group), cyano, and carboxylic acid are all meta to each other. So, if the carboxylic acid is position 1, then the formyl and cyano groups must be at positions 3 and 5, or 5 and 3. Because meta is three positions away when counting in a circle.

Wait, but wait a minute. If the three groups (acid, aldehyde, cyano) are all meta to each other, that's a bit tricky. Because in a benzene ring, three substituents can't all be meta unless they're in a 1,3,5 arrangement. Oh, that makes sense. So the carboxylic acid is at 1, formyl at 3, and cyano at 5? Or another arrangement? Let me confirm: in a benzene ring, positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. So yes, that must be the setup.

But wait, the problem says the formyl, cyano, and acid are all meta. So perhaps the formyl is at position 3, cyano at 5, and the acid at
