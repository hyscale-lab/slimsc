Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax is usually denoted by 'p' or sometimes 'plx' as the symbol. So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. Got it.

Wait, I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Like, parallax p is equal to 1 over distance d, but in parsecs, right? So p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if p increases, the distance decreases because they're inversely proportional.

But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate the number of stars N to the distance r. Oh wait, the question says "per unit range of distance", so maybe it's about the density of stars as a function of distance.

So N is proportional to 1/p^5. Since p is 1/d, substituting that in, N would be proportional to 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because p is 1/d, so 1/p is d. So 1/p^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. So N ∝ d^5? Because if p is small (which happens when d is large), then 1/p^5 becomes large, so N is large. So more stars are observed at larger distances in this particular region.

But how does this translate into changes in the number of stars per unit distance? Because the question says "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Oh, right, when they ask about the number per unit distance, I think that's the density. So maybe it's the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be N = 4π r² dr multiplied by some density function. But wait, wait. Wait, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/p^5. So if N is proportional to 1/p^5, and p is 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. But considering that N is the number of stars in a given volume, perhaps
