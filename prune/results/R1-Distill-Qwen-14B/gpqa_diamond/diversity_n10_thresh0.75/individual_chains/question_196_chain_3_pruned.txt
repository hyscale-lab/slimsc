Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, wait. I remember that in the classical harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. And ω is sqrt(k/m), so v_max = sqrt(k/m) * A. But wait, that's non-relativistic, right? Because in relativity, the speed can't exceed c, so we have to adjust things.

Oh right, in relativistic mechanics, the equations change. The energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. It's the total energy, which includes relativistic effects. So the energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, the kinetic energy is different. Let me think. In relativity, the total energy E is gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the kinetic energy is E - m c² = (gamma -1) m c².

But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (which is conserved) is the sum of kinetic and potential energies. So at maximum displacement (x = A), the potential energy is (1/2)k A², and the kinetic energy is zero. Conversely, at the equilibrium position, the potential is zero and the kinetic energy is maximum.

So the total energy E is (1/2)k A². But wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy is (gamma) m c². So at x=0, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the potential, but wait, the potential is (1/2)k x², which at x=0 is zero. So the kinetic energy is E = (gamma) m c² = (1/2)k A²?

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because in the classical case, E is (1/2)k A²
