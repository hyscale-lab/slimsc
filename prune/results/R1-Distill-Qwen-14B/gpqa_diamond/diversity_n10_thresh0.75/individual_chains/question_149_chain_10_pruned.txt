Okay, so I'm faced with this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a small synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows some anomalies. Specifically, there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, meaning each is about 0.5H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling because if it were, I'd expect more splitting, like a doublet of doublets or something. So, why are there two peaks for the same proton?

The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass. So the molecular weight is consistent, meaning same molecular formula. But the question is about why there are two peaks.

Hmm. The options given are A to D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that's the case, the NMR would probably show more signals, maybe including those from the precursor. But the NMR here has two peaks for the same proton, so I'm not sure if that fits. Plus LC-MS would have a different mass for the precursor, unless the question says otherwise. But the question says both peaks have the same mass spectrum as the expected molecule, so same mass. So A might not be it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images. In NMR, for an optically active compound with no chiral axis (like a simple molecule), the alpha-proton would be split into two because of the diastereotopic protons. Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show as a single peak because the peaks would average out, since the environment is symmetric. Unless it's a molecule with more than one stereocenter, but even then, maybe not. Or maybe in a peptide, the alpha proton could be split in a different way. Alternatively, in some cases, like if the molecule is in a certain conformation, but I'm not sure. Wait, but the question says the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So if it's a racemic mixture, the alpha-proton would be in the same environment, so the NMR would see them as one peak. Unless it's a case where the coupling is causing splitting, but the question says the coupling pattern rules that out. So maybe B isn't the right answer.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm a bit fuzzy on what 'double coupling' refers to. I think in peptide synthesis, when forming amides, sometimes if the reaction isn't complete or there's some process that leads to multiple coupling steps, you could get some by-products. But I'm not sure how that would result in two peaks for the same proton. Maybe if the coupling is happening twice, leading to some sort of isomerism? Or maybe it's about the presence of two different bonds, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, the question says the peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So maybe during the formation of the amide bond, the alpha proton is involved in some kind of coupling, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's about diastereomers.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images. They have different physical properties, so their NMR signals would be different. For example, if there are two diastereomers, each would have a different environment for the alpha-proton, leading to two separate peaks. But wait, in the question, the chemical shifts are similar, not too different. Also, the integrals add up to 1H. So if it's a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have the same number of alpha-protons. So for each diastereomer, the alpha-proton would be present once, so each would contribute to a peak. But would their shifts be similar? Maybe if the diastereomers
