Okay, so I've got this question here about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there's an atom whose decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. So 50 minutes have passed already. The next 150 minutes would take the total time to 200 minutes. But I'm not sure if the 150 is from now or from the initial time. The question says "the next 150 minutes", which I think means starting from the current time, so 50 minutes have gone by, then another 150. So total time from the start would be 200 minutes.

But wait, radioactive decay processes are memoryless, right? So the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't affect the future probability. Hmm, but wait. The initial setup says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe that's the half-life or something else, but wait, 32% is not a typical half-life number. Hmm.

Wait, the decay probability usually refers to the probability that the atom will decay in a given time interval. So
