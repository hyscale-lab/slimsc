Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through all the information again to make sure I don't miss anything.

The problem says a chemist found a white solid in a bottle and gathered some spectral data to identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to determine which one matches the data.

Let's look at the data provided. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, sometimes in mass spectrometry, the molecular ion can break apart, but the exact reason for a peak at 158 isn't immediately clear to me. Maybe it's an isotope peak or some kind of fragment.

The IR data shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since it's broad, I'm thinking maybe an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Also, the IR shows a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That region is typically where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. So, that's a clue pointing towards a carbonyl-containing compound, like a ketone, aldehyde, acid, ester, or something else with a carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR data. There's a peak at 11.0 ppm as a singlet (s) integrating for 1H. High chemical shifts (like around 10-12 ppm) are usually for aldehydic protons or carboxylic acid O-H protons. Wait, but in the NMR, a singlet suggests no neighboring protons. So, if it's an aldehyde, that would make sense because the aldehyde proton is usually deshielded and a singlet. But wait, carboxylic acid O-H can also be around 10-12 ppm. However, in D2O, the O-H might exchange and not show up, but if it's a solid, maybe it's still present. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group next to an electronegative atom.

Looking further, the NMR has a peak at 8.02 ppm as a doublet (d) for 2H, and another at 7.72 ppm as a doublet (d) for 2H. These seem to be aromatic protons. The doublet pattern suggests coupling between adjacent protons on a benzene ring. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, where there are two sets of doublets. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent having two protons that are equivalent. Wait, no, wait. If the ring is substituted with something in the para position, the protons on either side would be equivalent. But in this case, the protons are split into two doublets of 2H each. That makes me think of a benzene ring with substituents in such a way that there are two sets of doublets. Like in a para-substituted benzene with substituents in the para positions, but that might not give two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent on the ring that causes the neighboring protons to be split into two doublets. 

Wait, let's think of para-substituted benzaldehyde. For example, if the benzene has a substituent in the para position, like a Cl or another group. Then, the protons ortho to that substituent would be a pair, each coupling with each other. But perhaps in a para-substituted ring with an electron-withdrawing group, the ortho protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. But in this NMR, the upfield is 7.
