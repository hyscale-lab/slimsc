Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis pathways can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are four sequences of reactions, labeled A to D. I need to figure out which sequence correctly leads to the desired compound with high yield.

First, I should draw the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is in position 2, ethoxy in position 1, and nitro in position 3. Wait, no, actually, benzene is numbered in a way that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. Let me think: if the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3, but in the target, they're at 1, 2, and 3. Hmm, the target is 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so the numbering can be adjusted. Let me imagine the structure: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, substituents are at 1, 2, 3 positions. Alternatively, when looking at the substituents, perhaps their positions are as follows: nitro at para to ethoxy, but then tert-butyl is in another position. Wait, perhaps I should look at the substituents in the target molecule.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the substituents and their directing effects.

Benzene rings undergo electrophilic substitution. The substituents on the ring can be activating or deactivating, and can direct incoming groups to ortho, meta, or para positions.

The substituents we're adding are tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro.

Let's note that:

- tert-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group (electron-donating via induction and resonance). It's ortho/para-directing.
- Ethoxy is also activating (electron-donating via resonance and induction), and is ortho/para-directing
