Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum and heated, it forms another equimolar mixture Y of two liquids which doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, X and Y are each mixtures of two liquids.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Z is a component of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated—probably an alkane.

Additionally, there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So, whatever is in X doesn't have conjugated double bonds, which might influence how they react.

Alright, let's break this down. So the key steps are:

1. Mixture X (two liquids) decolorizes bromine water. That suggests that X contains some unsaturated compounds, like alkenes or alkynes, since they can react with bromine. But since it's a mixture, perhaps each component is an alkene or alkyne.

2. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. The product is a mixture of two liquids. The reaction is a disproportionation, so one substance is being both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but wait—Platinum is a catalyst, and heating. What kind of reaction would that be?

Wait, thinking about possible reactions—disproportionation reactions. For example, in alkenes, but maybe more in the context of other functional groups. Oh, wait, maybe it's about alkenes being hydrogenated in a way that leads to different products. Or perhaps it's about a reaction where one part adds hydrogen and another loses it? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so Y's components are more saturated. Since X could have alkenes, Y might have something else.

Then, when X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, they give Z. So, hydrogenation of X and Y leads to the same product, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen.

Let me compute the molecular formula of Z first. The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, so we can find the ratio of C to H.

14.28% H means that in Z, H is 14.28% by mass. Let's assume the formula is CnHm.

The mass of hydrogen per molecule is (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) * 100 =14.28.

Wait, but I can think of 14.28% as 1/7, since 14.28 is approximately 1/7 of 100. So 1/7.

So, (m * 1)/(12n + m) ) = 1/7.

Which simplifies to 7m = 12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n. Hmm, that's an alkene? Wait, but wait, Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen, which implies it's fully saturated—alkane. So, this is a contradiction. Hmm.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28% → 14.28 = (m * 1) / (12n + m) ) * 100.

So, 14.28 = (m) / (12n + m) * 100 → (14.28/100) = m/(12n + m) → 0.1428 = m/(12n + m)

Multiply both sides by denominator: 0.1428*(12n + m) = m → 1.7136n + 0.1428m = m → 1.7136n = 0.8572m → Approximately, 1.7136n ≈ 0.8572 m.

Divide both sides by 0.8572: (1.7136/0.8572) n ≈ m → Approximately 2n ≈ m.

So m is about 2n. So the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene, but Z is an alkane. Contradiction.

Wait, unless I made a mistake. Oh wait, maybe the mass fraction is not of H but of H in the molecule. Let me think again.

Wait, wait, the problem says that Z is a hydrocarbon. So C and H only. Let's assume Z is CnHm.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is 14.28%. So,

( m * 1 ) / (12n + m ) = 0.1428.

So,

m / (12n + m) = 0.1428 → Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

m = 0.1428 * 12n + 0.1428 m → m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136 n → 0.8572 m ≈ 1.7136 n → m ≈ (1.7136 / 0.8572) n → ≈ 2n.

So m=2n.

So formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene (double bond). But Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react with hydrogen further. So, it's not an alkene—so perhaps it's an alkane.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 14.28% exactly.

14.28% is 1/7.

So,

m/(12n + m) = 1/7 → 7m =12n + m → 6m =12n → m=2n.

Same result. So the formula is CnH2n, which is an alkene. But that would mean Z has a double bond, which can react with hydrogen. But the problem states that Z doesn't react further, so it must be a single bond—so perhaps it's an alkane.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe Z is a cyclic compound with a double bond but in a ring where hydrogenation doesn't proceed easily. Or perhaps miscalculating—maybe it's 14.28% is not 1/7. Let me check: 1/7 is approximately 0.142857, so 14.2857%. So yes, 14.28% is 1/7. So the calculation holds.

Wait, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane. For example, cyclohexane. Let's see:

Cyclohexane is C6H12. Molar mass is (6*12)+(12*1)=72+12=84. Hydrogen mass is 12→12/84=14.2857%. Exactly! So Z is cyclohexane.

So Z is cyclohexane, C6H12. Which has a ring structure—so hydrogenation would require more severe conditions. But wait, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, fully saturated. So, in that case, why does it have a mass fraction of 14.28% H?

Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. So the molar mass is 6*12 +12*1 =72+12=84. Hydrogen mass is 12, so 12/84= 14.2857% → yes, that's correct.

So, Z is cyclohexane.

So, Z is a component of Y. Also, the hydrogenation of Y must produce Z.

But wait, the hydrogenation of Y gives Z, which is cyclohexane.

So Y must contain a compound that, when hydrogenated, becomes cyclohexane. So Y could have a ring with a double bond, perhaps cyclohexene. But cyclohexene hydrogenated would give cyclohexane. Alternatively, Y could have another structure that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, but wait. The hydrogenation of Y gives Z, which is cyclohexane. So Y must have at least a ring with a double bond, like cyclohexene. Because when hydrogenated, cyclohexene becomes
