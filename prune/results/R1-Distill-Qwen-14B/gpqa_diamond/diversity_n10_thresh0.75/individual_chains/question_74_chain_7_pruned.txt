Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. So the scenario is that we have an atom, and we're monitoring it after some time. The question is about finding the probability that it will decay within the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay.

Wait, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. Oh right, the decay probability is independent of time, which means it doesn't matter how much time has already passed; each atom has a constant probability of decaying in any given time interval. But wait, that's not exactly right. Oh wait, no, the decay probability per unit time is constant, so the chance of decaying in a certain time depends on the remaining time, not the time that's already passed.

So the problem states that the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%. So I think that 32% is the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes or less. But wait, how is this related to the decay constant or the half-life?

Wait, maybe I should model this with the decay equation. The general formula for the probability that an atom has not decayed after time t is N(t)/N0 = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So the probability of decay by time t is 1 minus that, so P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

Given that, for t=100 minutes, P(100
