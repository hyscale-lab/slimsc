Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question is asking which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. The options are four statements, and we have to pick the correct combination.

First, what's the impulse approximation? From what I remember, it's an approximation where each nucleon in a nucleus behaves as if it's a free particle. So, when interactions happen, like electroweak interactions, each nucleon acts independently without considering the others much. It's like saying each one doesn't feel the presence of the others except when the interaction happens.

So the four assumptions given are:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.

I need to figure out which combination of these implies the approximation.

Let me go through each statement.

Assumption 1: Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That sounds like it's saying the interaction is with each nucleon separately. If each nucleon is treated independently, that aligns with the impulse idea. So this seems relevant.

Assumption 2: The nucleus is transparent except for the selected nucleon. So, except for the one being hit, the others don't affect the interaction. That fits with the idea that only one nucleon is involved, and the rest are like a backdrop. So yes, this would support the impulse approximation.

Assumption 3: Quarks inside the nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, why would that matter for the approximation? I'm not so sure. The impulse approximation is more about how the nucleons interact with external forces, not about their internal structure. Non-relativistic quarks might be a separate assumption maybe for simplifying calculations within the nucleon, but I don't think it directly contributes to the impulse approximation. Maybe this isn't a necessary part of the joint assumptions for the impulse.

Assumption 4: The selected nucleon experiences no binding forces during interaction. Oh, right, in the impulse approximation, the nucleon is treated as free, so it's not bound by the nuclear force during the interaction. So this makes sense. If the nucleon isn't bound, it can move freely, which is the basis of the approximation.

So which assumptions are needed? The impulse approximation requires that each nucleon is treated as free, so during the interaction, only one is involved, and the others don't affect it. So statements 1, 2, and 4 seem necessary.

Wait, but what about statement 3? Does it matter if the quarks are non-relativistic? I'm not sure. The impulse approximation is about the nucleon's behavior in the nucleus, not about the internal dynamics of the nucleon. So the quarks' state (non-relativistic) might be a separate consideration, perhaps for other approximations like in calculating form factors or matrix elements. But it's not directly related to the impulse approximation itself.

So the correct combination should include 1, 2, and
