Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product after a certain reaction. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, cyclohexenecarboxylic acid suggests a six-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group and some double bonds. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So the structure is cyclohexene, with a carboxylic acid group at position 3 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene), a formyl at 2, and a vinyl at 5.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in dehydrohalogenation or maybe in some elimination reactions. Alternatively, when HI is used with something like a conjugated diene, or maybe it's a case of the Prins reaction? Or perhaps it's a case of adding iodide to double bonds.

Wait, wait, another thought. Red phosphorus and HI is a standard reagent for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but no, that involves ketones. Wait, maybe it's a case of dehydrohalogenation or perhaps an elimination reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a Michael addition or something else. Hmm, I'm not recalling exactly, so perhaps I should think about the structure.

Wait, wait, maybe it's a case of the addition of iodide across a double bond. Because HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. The starting compound has a cyclohexene ring, so that's a double bond. Let me think about the structure.

So the starting molecule, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has a cyclohexene ring. So positions 3 and 4 are double-bonded (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (so that's a CH₂CH₂– group, but wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So the substituents are at 2, 3, 5, and 6 perhaps? Wait, no, the numbering is such that the double bond is 3 and 4, the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Wait, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene is at position 3, meaning the double bond is between C3 and C4. The carboxylic acid is on C3? Wait, no, wait. Carboxylic acid is substituent on the cyclohexene ring. So the main chain is the cyclohexene, and the substituents are the formyl at C2 and the vinyl at C5.

So the structure is a six-membered
