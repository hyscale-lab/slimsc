Okay, so here's this chemistry problem I need to solve. Let's read it again. We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this and determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, right? So when you add acid to it, they should react. The reaction between a hydroxide and an acid would produce water and a salt. Since Fe(OH)3 is reacting with a monobasic strong acid, the salt formed should be Fe^3+ ions and the acid's conjugate base.

Wait, the acid is monobasic and strong. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule. So, for example, HCl, HNO3, etc. They fully dissociate in water.

So the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + H+ → Fe^3+ + H2O. But wait, since it's a strong acid, it'll donate H+ ions readily. So the acid will protonate the hydroxide.

First, I think I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 are present. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(16 +1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles, or about 9.36e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 has 3 moles of OH- ions. So when it reacts with H+, each OH- will take one H+. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, you need 3 moles of H+.

So the moles of H+ needed is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, which means 0.1 moles per liter. Since 1 liter is 1000 cm³, 100 cm³ is 0.1 liters. Wait, no: wait, the volume of the solution is 100 cm³, but the volume of the acid we're adding is what we need to find. Let me clarify.

Wait, the total solution volume is 100 cm³. So the acid is being added to this solution. The volume of the acid solution will contribute to the total volume. Hmm, but maybe the problem is considering that the acid volume is much smaller than 100 cm³, so we can approximate
