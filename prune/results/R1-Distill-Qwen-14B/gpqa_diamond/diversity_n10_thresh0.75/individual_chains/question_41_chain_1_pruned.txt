Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates through it. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles. Oh right, this probably involves both the index of refraction and some sort of relative velocity addition, maybe like the Doppler effect or something from special relativity.

Wait, no, the Doppler effect is more about frequency and wavelength shifts. But in this case, the question is about the speed of light relative to the observer. So let's think about the speed of light in a medium and then how the medium's motion affects the overall speed.

The speed of light in a medium is given by v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. So in the glass, it's moving at v_medium = 1/n (since c is 1 here). But the glass itself is moving with velocity v in the same direction as the light beam.

Wait, but waitâ€”how do you combine the velocities here? If the medium is moving, does the speed of the light in the medium simply add to the medium's velocity? Like, if the medium is moving at velocity v, and the light's speed in the medium is v_medium, then the observer would see the light moving at v_medium + v? But that might not be correct because of relativity.

Wait, but in the case of non-relativistic speeds, perhaps we can use the Galilean addition of velocities. Because if v is small compared to c, we can approximate. But the question doesn't specify that v is small, so maybe I should think in terms of special relativity.

Wait, no, because the glass itself is moving, and the light is in the glass. So the speed of the light relative to the lab frame would be the speed of the glass plus the speed of the light within the glass, but I'm not sure if that's correct under relativity or just Galilean.

Alternatively, maybe the speed of light in the medium is always c (which is 1 here), but considering the medium's movement. Wait, no, that's not right. Because when a medium moves, the speed of light in the medium doesn't change relative to the medium, but how does that speed translate to the lab frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The glass is moving with velocity v. The light is moving through the glass with speed v_light = 1/n in the medium. But since the medium is moving, the lab frame would see the light's speed as v_light + v? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, no, in reality, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, but that's the speed relative to the medium. So when the medium itself is moving, the observed speed in the lab frame should be the sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity within the medium.

Wait, but that's under the Galilean transformation, which is only accurate at non-relativistic speeds. However, the options given don't involve any square roots or relativistic terms, so perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using Gal
