Okay, so I have this physics problem about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v, same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. The index of refraction is n, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Wait, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. But here, the medium itself is moving. So I think this is a case where I need to consider the velocity addition from special relativity, maybe? Or is it just a simple additive thing?

Wait, no. Because I remember that in classical mechanics, velocities add up linearly, but that doesn't apply when dealing with light. Oh right, because light's speed is constant in all inertial frames according to Einstein's postulate. So if the glass is moving, the speed of light inside it as measured by the lab frame shouldn't just be the sum or difference of velocities.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. But the light inside the glass is moving at v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion, right?

Wait no, because the light's speed in the medium is v_light = c/n. But the medium is moving. So the lab frame would see the light's speed as the speed of the medium plus the speed of light within it. No, that's not right, because in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but v is the velocity of the glass, and the light is moving at v_light in the glass's frame. So from the lab frame, the light's velocity would be v_light + v, but that's only in the classical sense. But since light's speed is always c according to any frame, but wait, in this case, the light isn't in a vacuum anymore. So maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, let me clarify. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. The light inside the glass, from the glass's frame, is moving at speed v_light = c/n. So to find the speed as observed in the lab, I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition. Because the
