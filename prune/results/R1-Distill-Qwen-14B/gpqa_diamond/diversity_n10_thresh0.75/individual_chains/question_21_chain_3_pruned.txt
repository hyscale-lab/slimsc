Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main part is about two compounds. The first part is determining which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. The second part is figuring out between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate which will show optical isomerism.

Let's tackle part A first. Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift the position of a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structural isomers, especially in compounds with conjugated systems or enols and ketones. So, I need to think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: I remember that quinones are cyclic ketones. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, no, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O. Wait, no, wait, benzoquinone can be either para or ortho. Like, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups. For example, para-benzoquinone is 1,4-benzoquinone. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Hmm, so the two ketone groups are across from each other on the benzene ring.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups, each on adjacent carbons. So, the structure is O=C-(CH2) in a ring. Wait, maybe more accurately, it's a cyclohexane ring with ketone groups on carbons 1, 3, and 5. So, the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C in a ring. So, the molecule is 1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarboxylic acid, but probably as the anhydride or something else. Wait, no, the name is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, so each of those positions has a ketone group.

Tautomerism typically happens when a structure can shift from one tautomer to another. For example, in a carbonyl group, if there's an adjacent hydrogen, the alpha hydrogen, it can tautomerize. Like in a diketone, if there's an alpha hydrogen, it can form an enol. So, if a molecule has multiple ketone groups, but if there are no alpha hydrogens, it can't tautomerize.

So, let's check each compound.

Benzoquinone: The structure is O=C6H4=O. Each ketone is attached to the benzene ring. The adjacent carbons are part of the ring, which are spÂ² hybridized. So, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are directly attached to the benzene ring. So, the carbons next to the carbonyl are part of the ring, which doesn't have any hydrogens attached (since benzene is fully conjugated with no hydrogens on the carbonyl-bearing carbons). Wait, no, in 1,
