Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about. So, there are three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. I remember that TTV is a method used to detect exoplanets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transits as it passes in front of its star. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here, maybe it's just background info.

The question gives me some ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and asks about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. Also, all have the same albedo, which is 0.3, similar to Earth. So albedo doesn't vary here, which I think affects the equilibrium temperature because it changes how much light is reflected.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Temperature ratio Planet1 to Planet2: T1/T2 ≈ 1.4
- Temperature ratio Planet2 to Planet3: T2/T3 ≈ 2.3
- Mass ratio Planet1 to Planet2: M1/M2 ≈ 1.15
- Mass ratio Planet2 to Planet3: M2/M3 ≈ 1.35
- Albedo (α) for all is 0.3
- Find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Hmm. So I need to find (P3/P1) factor. But how?

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its distance from the star, the star's luminosity, and the planet's albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature (Te) is something like:

Te = [ (L (1 - α) ) / (16 * π * σ * D^2) ) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, D is the distance from the star, and α is the albedo.

Wait, but L and σ are the same for all planets since they orbit the same star, right? So L and σ are constants for each system. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the distance (since Te is proportional to (L(1-α)/D²)^0.25). So, if I can relate the distances, I can get the periods.

But wait, how is distance related to orbital period? Oh, Kepler's third law! Which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius, D.

Kepler's law formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * D³, where M is the mass of the star. So, if all three planets orbit the same star, M is the same for each. Therefore, the period squared is proportional to D cubed. So P ∝ D^(3/2).

Therefore, if I can find the ratio of D3 to D1, I can find the ratio of P3 to P1.

So, how to find D3/D1?

From the equilibrium temperature ratios. Let me think: Since Te is proportional to (L(1-α)/D²)^0.25, and L and α are the same, we can write:

Te ∝ (1/D²)^0.25 = D^(-0.5)

So, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D), which means sqrt(D) ∝ 1/Te → D ∝ 1/Te².

So, D3/D1 = (Te1 / Te3)^2.

But wait, let me check that. If Te ∝ D^(-½), then D ∝ (Te)^(-2). Therefore, D3 = D1 * (Te1 / Te3)^2.

Wait, no: Let me be precise. Let's write:

Te1 / Te3 = (D3 / D1) ^ (-1/2)

So, (Te1 / Te3) = (D3/D1)^(-½) → (Te1/Te3)^2 = (D3/D1)^(-1) → D3/D1 = (Te1/Te3)^(-2)

Wait, I think I messed that up. Let me do it algebraically.

Let's say Te1 = K * D1^(-½), and Te3 = K * D3^(-½). So Te1/Te3 = (D3/D1)^(½).

So, (Te1/Te3) = sqrt(D3/D1)

=> (Te1/Te3)^2 = D3/D1.

So D3 = D1 * (Te1/Te3)^2.
