Okay, so I've got this question about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainties in position and momentum. The question says that an electron is traveling along the x-direction with a speed v, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is given. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, let's think. The principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. So first, I should calculate Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Oh right, because momentum p is mass times velocity. The electron's mass is known, right? It's about 9.11 x 10^-31 kg. The velocity is given as 2e8 m/s. But wait, the speed is given, but the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum. Or wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of energy and momentum being related through kinetic energy.

Wait, the energy in question here is the kinetic energy. The minimum uncertainty in energy would be related to the uncertainty in momentum. Because the kinetic energy E_k is (p²)/(2m), so if we have an uncertainty in p, that would translate to an uncertainty in E.

Alternatively, maybe using the uncertainty principle for energy and time? Wait, no, the question gives an uncertainty in position, so probably it's the position-momentum uncertainty that's the starting point.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the uncertainty in momentum Δp using Δx. Since Δx is given as 0.
