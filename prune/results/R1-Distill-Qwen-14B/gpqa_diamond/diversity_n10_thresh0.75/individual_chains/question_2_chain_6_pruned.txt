Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out how many carbon atoms are in product 3. Let me walk through each step carefully.

The starting material is trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Trans-cinnamaldehyde has a double bond in the cinnamic acid part, right? So its structure is probably something like CH2=CH-C6H4-CHO. Wait, no, wait. Actually, cinnamaldehyde is an aldehyde with a benzene ring attached. The structure is benzaldehyde with a propenal side chain. So it's more like Ph-CH₂-CHO, but wait, no, wait. Oh wait, cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde of cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is Ph-CH₂-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. Its structure is a benzene ring with a propenal group attached. So it's benzene connected to a CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, propenal is CH2=CH-CHO. Oh wait, maybe the structure is Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, no. Let me think: Cinnamaldehyde is (E)-3-phenylprop-2-enal. So it's Ph-CH=CH-CHO. Wait, but no, the numbering would make it Ph-CH₂-CHO with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me sketch it out mentally. The structure is benzene ring connected to a CH-CHO group, with a double bond between the CH and the next CH. So, it's Ph-CH₂-CHO with a double bond between CH₂ and CHO? No, perhaps it's Ph-CH=CH₂-CHO? No, wait, I think I'm mixing up the structure. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde with the structure C6H5-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no, that's not right. I think I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll go by what I know. Oh, wait, I remember that cinnamaldehyde has a benzene ring attached to a propenyl group, which is an aldehyde. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No,
