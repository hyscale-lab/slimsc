Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the fission of an atomic nucleus. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, the nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest-mass. The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass M. The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. I need to find the difference between the correct T1 value and the one calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, step by step. First, let me figure out the masses of the two fragments. Let me denote the smaller mass as m, so the larger is 2m. The total rest mass after fission is m + 2m = 3m. The problem says that this sum is 99% of the initial mass M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M? Wait, wait. M is 300 GeV/c²? Or just M is the initial mass, and we can work with proportions.

Wait, the rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So, M c² = 300 GeV. I'm probably going to have to work with energies in GeV, but the options are in MeV, so I'll need to convert at some point.

So, the rest masses of the two fragments sum to 0.99 M. So, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. And m1 = 2 m2. So substituting, 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says the sum is 99% of the initial mass. So 3m = 0.99 M → m=0.33 M. So m1 is 2m = 0.66 M, and m2 is 0.33 M. So fragment 1 is more massive than fragment 2.

Now, the nucleus is initially at rest. After fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions because of momentum conservation. So their momenta are equal and opposite. Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for fragments 1 and 2.

In the non-relativistic case, we can use conservation of momentum and energy. The initial momentum is zero, so after fission, the vector sum of the momenta is zero. So m1 v1 = m2 v2 in magnitude, but opposite in direction. Wait, but in non-relativistic, it's m1 v1 = m2 v2, but considering directions, so v1 = -(m2/m1) v2. Since m1 is 2m2, m1 = 2 m2 → m2 = m1/2. So v1 = -( (m1/2) / (m1) ) v2 = - (v2)/2. So v
