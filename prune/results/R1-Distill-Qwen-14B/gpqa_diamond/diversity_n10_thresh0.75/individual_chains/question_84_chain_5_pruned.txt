Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one by approximating the matrix exponential function with a fractional approximation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that solving partial differential equations (PDEs) like the heat equation often involves discretizing the domain, leading to large systems of equations. These systems are usually represented as matrix equations, which can be solved using various methods. The matrix exponential comes into play when dealing with the time evolution of systems, especially in methods like the exponential time differencing.

In the context of parallel algorithms, the idea is to split the problem into smaller parts that can be computed simultaneously. One approach I recall is the parallelization of the time integration, where the time interval is divided into subintervals. Each subinterval's contribution can be computed in parallel, then combined.

The question mentions that the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods... I'm not exactly sure, but I think they involve approximating the exponential function using polynomials or other functions. Pad√© approximants come to mind. They are rational function approximations that can model complex functions like exponentials with high accuracy.

Now, the key factor for converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. I think it's about how the approximation allows for splitting the computation. In sequential methods, you process each time step one after another. But for parallel methods, you need to break the problem so that different parts can be handled at the same time.

If the approximation uses a linear partial fraction, that might allow the matrix to be decomposed into parts that can be exponentiated separately. Wait, linear partial fraction decomposition is a technique where a rational function is broken down into simpler fractions. For example, (A+B)/(C) might be split into A/C + B/C. If the matrix exponential's approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that each can be computed independently, that would enable parallel computation. Because each term could be handled by a different processor or core.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option D is "Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation." That sounds like it's about decomposing the approximation into parts that can be handled in parallel. Option C is about complex roots, which might relate to the stability or the nature of the approximation (like poles in the complex plane), but I'm not sure how that directly leads to parallelism.

Stability analysis (option A) is important for ensuring the numerical method works correctly, but it's not the key factor in making the algorithm parallel. Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions (option B) seems more related to the setup of the problem rather than the parallelization method.

So, I'm leaning towards option D. The linear partial fraction decomposition would allow the matrix to be split, making each part's exponential computable in parallel. That way, each term can be processed independently, and their results combined at the end. This approach would significantly speed up the computation, especially for large matrices, by utilizing parallel resources.
