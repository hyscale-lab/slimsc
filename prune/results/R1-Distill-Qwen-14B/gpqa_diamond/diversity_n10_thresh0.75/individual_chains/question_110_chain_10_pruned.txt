Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. The question gives me some parameters for each star and the observing limits of the two instruments.

I think I need to figure out the apparent V magnitude of each star because both ESPRESSO and HIRES have different limits. So the key here is determining which stars have apparent magnitudes within the detectable range of both instruments.

Let me look at the information given. For ESPRESSO, stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because the lower the magnitude number, the brighter the star. Wait, no, no—wait, no, lower magnitude means brighter. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, which is their limit.

HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, wait, so the same logic. So HIRES can see stars with apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 mag. Because if a star is brighter than (apparent magnitude) 16, that's m <16. So, the brighter the star (lower m), the better.

So the goal is to find stars that have apparent V magnitudes <=17 (for ESPRESSO) AND <=16 (for HIRES), but wait, no—ESPRESSO can detect up to 17, HIRES up to 16. So for a star to be detectable by both, it has to have apparent V magnitude <=16 because that's the stricter limit. Because if a star is fainter than 16 (like 16.5), HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, but HIRES can't. So for a star to be detectable by both, it must have apparent magnitude <=16.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Wait, "brighter than 17 mag" means magnitude less than 17.
