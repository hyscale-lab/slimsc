Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But wait, this is relativistic, so I guess things are different because of relativity.

The question gives me a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hook's law. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's because the potential energy at maximum displacement (A) converts into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point (x=0). So (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But this is the non-relativistic case. Since the problem is relativistic, I can't use that formula directly.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is exactly that formula. So maybe option C is the non-relativistic case, which is a hint. So the answer must be something else.

Relativity comes into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. The energy in relativity is given by the total energy, which is gamma m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is conserved. At maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So I can set the potential energy equal to the kinetic energy.

Wait, but what's the potential energy in a relativistic oscillator? Oh, wait, the force is F = -kx, so the potential energy is (1/2)kx², same as classical.

So at x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². At x=0, all that energy becomes kinetic, which in relativity is (gamma - 1) m c². Because kinetic energy is total energy minus rest mass energy: KE = (gamma m c²) - (m c²) = m c² (gamma - 1).

So, setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = m c² (gamma - 1).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²
