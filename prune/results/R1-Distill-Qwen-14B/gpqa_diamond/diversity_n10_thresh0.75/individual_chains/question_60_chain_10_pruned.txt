Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's because of Einstein's theory of relativity, right?

So the problem says that these aliens have a spacecraft going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Wow, that's really close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. Wait, so from Earth's perspective, when the astronaut leaves, how old will they be when they arrive? And from the astronaut's perspective, how much time passes for them? Because time would be experienced differently.

The question is about the astronaut's own perception of time. So I need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the moving frame of reference—in this case, the astronaut's ship.

First, I think I need to find out the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the actual distance, but I can find it by recalling some astronomy facts. I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me go with an approximate value, like 170,000 light-years. So the distance is about d = 170,000 ly.

The spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. So from Earth's perspective, the time taken for the journey would be t = d / v. Let's calculate that.

t = 170,000 ly / 0.99999987c. But since the speed is very close to c, I can approximate it as t ≈ 170,000 / 1 = 170,000 years. Wait, but that's from Earth's frame. But the astronaut is traveling at such a high speed that their own experienced time is much less due to time dilation.

Wait, I should calculate the time from the astronaut's perspective using the time dilation formula. The proper time τ is given by the equation τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because the astronaut's clock runs slower from Earth's frame
