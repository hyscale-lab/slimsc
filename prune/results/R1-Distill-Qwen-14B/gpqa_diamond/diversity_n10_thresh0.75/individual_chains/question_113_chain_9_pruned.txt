Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Hmm. Let me break down the information given from each technique.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an alcohol (like an -OH stretch) or maybe a carbonyl group? No, the carbonyl is higher, like around 1700 they mentioned. So the broad peak is more likely an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 1700 is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower. Could that be another carbonyl, maybe like an ester or conjugated carbonyl? Or perhaps a conjugated double bond, like an aromatic ring with C=C?

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the molecule has a double bond, maybe part of an aromatic ring or an isolated double bond. So maybe something like an alkene or an aromatic ring.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, m/z 45. What could that be? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of a CH3CO group. Wait, because CH3CO is 12 + 12 + 16 = 40? Wait, no, wait: CH3CO is 2 carbons, so (2*12) + (3*1) + 16 (O) = 24 +3 +16=43? Wait that's 43. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group? Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: the m/z 45 could be the fragment corresponding to a ketone group. Or perhaps it's a loss of a fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage product. Let me think of the possible molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2: molecular weight is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116.

B) C6H10O: (6*12)+(10)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

C) C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114.

D) C6H12O: 72+12+16=100.

Wait, but the mass spectrum's fragment is m/z=45. So maybe the molecular ion breaks into a fragment of 45. Let's think about which of these formulas could have a fragment at 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular weight is 45 higher than the rest? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the molecular ion is losing something. Let me think about possible fragmentations.

Wait, another approach: what functional groups are indicated by the IR and NMR?

The FTIR has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 is a carbonyl. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated ester, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Alternatively, it might be an amide, but I don't think that's the case here because the options don't have nitrogen.

Wait, if the molecule has two carbonyl groups, then perhaps it
