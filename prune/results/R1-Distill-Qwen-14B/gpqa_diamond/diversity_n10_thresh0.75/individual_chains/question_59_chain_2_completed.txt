Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not entirely confident with these kinds of pH calculations, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

So the problem is about finding the pH of a solution that's made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A to D, which are numbers, so it's a numerical answer question.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think the first step is to figure out how much acid and base are present and see if they neutralize each other. If not, whichever is in excess will determine the pH.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of each component.

Starting with acetic acid: CH3COOH is 0.1 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. So 0.05 mol of CH3COOH.

Next, HCl. It's 0.2 M in 400 mL. So moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, giving 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's 0.3 M in 300 mL. Barium hydroxide dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each formula unit gives 2 OH^- ions, right? So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. But each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, so the moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol. So 0.18 mol of OH-.

Wait, but OH- is a strong base. So it will react with the H+ ions from the acids.

So the plan is to find the total H+ and OH- concentrations, and see which is in excess.

Wait, but wait: HCl is a strong acid, so it provides H+ ions. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it will also provide some H+ but not completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, providing OH- which will react with H+.

So first, perhaps I should calculate the total H+ from all the acids, and the total OH- from the base, and see how they react.

Wait, but the problem is that when you mix them, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. CH3COOH is weak, so maybe I should consider its contribution after the neutralization.

But wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, wait, HCl is a strong acid; so it will fully dissociate into H+ and Cl-.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate, but when H+ is neutralized by OH-, the weak acid might dissociate more. Hmm, but wait, in this case, perhaps because the strong acid and strong base are present, the weak acid's contribution can be considered after neutralization.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first calculate the total H+ and OH- contributions, and see if there's an excess of H+ or OH-.

Wait, but HCl provides H+ (0.08 mol) and CH3COOH provides some H+ (which I'll have to consider as a weak acid, but maybe after any neutralization).

Ba(OH)2 provides OH- (0.18 mol).

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol. The OH- is 0.18 mol. So when they react, H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ available from HCl and CH3COOH: Let's think. Wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, but it only partially dissociates. But when OH- is added, it will neutralize some of the H+ from HCl and perhaps from CH3COOH.

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to first neutralize the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH with the OH- from Ba(OH)2, and then see what's left.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total H+ and OH-:

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: Let's think. Since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate all H+ first. So the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react with H+ from HCl first, and if there's any OH- left, it will react with CH3COOH.

Wait, actually, the OH- will neutralize H+ regardless of the source. So the order is that OH- will react with H+ from all acids.

So, total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl gives 0.08 mol H+.

CH3COOH gives, since it's a weak acid, but in solution, it may contribute some H+.

But when OH- is added, the OH- will take H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but wait, the OH- comes in 0.18 mol.

So let's calculate the net H+ or OH- after neutralization.

The total H+ available is from HCl (0.08) plus the H+ from CH3COOH (which is less than 0.05, but perhaps we can calculate it exactly after considering neutralization).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so its H+ at initial state is less than 0.05 mol, but when OH- is added, the OH- will neutralize some of it.

So, let's compute the initial H+:

Total H+ = 0.08 (from HCl) + [CH3COOH's H+].

But CH3COOH's H+ is given by Ka. The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5, but perhaps we can compute it.

Wait, but when we mix all the solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

But before that, let's think about the moles of H+ and OH-.

Moles of H+:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 mol. But since it's a weak acid, it contributes some H+ which we can calculate.

But in the presence of OH-, the OH- will react with all available H+.

Wait, let's think of it as a neutralization reaction.

Total moles of H+ available before considering CH3COOH: 0.08 (from HCl) + (some from CH3COOH). But perhaps it's better to first neutralize HCl's H+ with OH-.

The OH- is 0.18 mol.

H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

So, OH- will react with H+ as:

OH- + H+ → H2O.

So, 0.08 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH-.

The OH- will neutralize the H+ from HCl, leaving:

After neutralization: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH- remaining.

Wait, because HCl's H+ is 0.08, which OH- can neutralize. So 0.08 H+ reacts with 0.08 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Wait, no: because OH- is 0.18, H+ is 0.08, so the OH- in excess is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

So after neutralizing HCl's H+, there's 0.10 mol OH- left, which will then react with the CH3COOH.

Wait, but CH3COOH is an acid; OH- will deprotonate it. So the OH- will react with the CH3COOH, converting it into acetate ions.

So the CH3COOH is 0.05 mol.

The OH- left after HCl is 0.10 mol.

So, OH- will react with CH3COOH as follows:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So moles of OH- reacting with CH3COOH: 0.05 mol (since CH3COOH is 0.05 mol).

So after that, the OH- left is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

Wait, but wait: the OH- is 0.10, and CH3COOH is 0.05, so all CH3COOH will be neutralized, and OH- will have 0.05 mol left.

Wait, so after all that, we have excess OH- of 0.05 mol.

Wait, let me recast that:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18.

So H+ (0.08) and OH- (0.18) will neutralize each other, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

Then, this OH- (0.10) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 mol), which has one H+ to give.

So, 0.10 mol OH- reacting with 0.05 mol CH3COOH: The OH- will take all the H+ from CH3COOH, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH- in solution.

Wait, but wait: CH3COOH has 0.05 mol. When OH- (0.05) reacts, it neutralizes it, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the final solution has 0.05 mol OH-.

Wait, but what about the volumes? Because the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check that again.

Wait, the initial steps:

1. Moles of HCl's H+: 0.08.

2. Moles of Ba(OH)2's OH-: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each unit gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

3. The OH- (0.18) will react with H+ from HCl (0.08) and from CH3COOH.

Let me think of it as:

Total H+ available from all acids: HCl (0.08) + CH3COOH (0.05) → 0.13 mol H+.

But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't release all 0.05 mol H+. So the actual H+ is less than that.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the exact H+ from CH3COOH after considering the neutralization with OH-.

Wait, maybe I should approach it as a neutralization reaction.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08.

Total OH-: 0.18.

They neutralize each other, but since OH- is higher, the excess is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

This excess OH- will then react with the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH (0.05 mol) is a weak acid, which can donate H+. So, the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH.

So, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, for each mole of CH3COOH, one mole of OH- is consumed.

We have 0.05 mol CH3COOH and 0.10 mol OH-.

So, the OH- will consume all 0.05 mol CH3COOH, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, finally, after all reactions, there's 0.05 mol OH- in the solution.

Wait, but wait, what about the chloride ions from HCl and acetate ions from CH3COO^-?

They don't affect the pH, since they're spectator ions.

So, the total solution volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, the pOH is calculated as:

pOH = -log[OH-] ≈ -log(0.0416667).

Let me compute that. 0.0416667 is approximately 4.16667e-2.

Log(4.16667e-2) is log(4.16667) + log(1e-2).

Log(4.16667) is about 0.62 (since 10^0.62 is around 4.17).

So log(4.16667e-2) = 0.62 - 2 = -1.38.

So pOH is 1.38.

Then, pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option A is 12.62, so I think that's the answer.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let me calculate [OH-] precisely.

0.05 mol / 1.2 L = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) = ?

Using a calculator: log(0.0416667) is log(4.16667 × 10^-2) → log(4.16667) ≈ 0.62, so log(4.16667e-2) is about 0.62 - 2 = -1.38. So pOH is 1.38, so pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62. That's option A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in considering all the H+ sources.

Wait, another way to think: first, calculate the total H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

H+ from CH3COOH: let's compute it using the formula for weak acids.

The formula for a weak acid is [H+] = sqrt(Ka * C), where C is the concentration.

Wait, but wait, when you mix all solutions, the concentration of CH3COOH is 0.05 mol in 1.2 L, so C = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.8 × 10^-5.

So [H+] from CH3COOH alone is sqrt(1.8e-5 * 0.0416667) ≈ sqrt(7.5e-7) ≈ 2.74e-4 M.

So moles of H+ from CH3COOH: 2.74e-4 M * 1.2 L ≈ 3.29e-4 mol.

So total H+ before any reaction would be 0.08 + 3.29e-4 ≈ 0.080329 mol.

But then, OH- is 0.18 mol. So H+ + OH- → H2O.

So 0.080329 + 3.29e-4 ≈ 0.080329.

Wait, but wait, the OH- is 0.18, which is much larger than the H+.

So, 0.080329 mol H+ reacts with 0.18 mol OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.080329 ≈ 0.10 mol OH-.

Wait, but wait, the reaction with CH3COOH would then proceed.

So the OH- (0.10 mol) will react with CH3COOH (0.05 mol) as follows:

Each mole of OH- neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH.

So, 0.05 mol CH3COOH will neutralize 0.05 mol OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-.

So the same conclusion as before, 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L, [OH-] ≈ 0.0416667 M.

So pH is 12.62, option A.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because in some cases, the weak acid may not completely neutralize the OH-, but in this case, the OH- is in excess after HCl is neutralized, so it will fully neutralize the CH3COOH, leaving some OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the reaction more precisely.

Wait, when OH- is added to the solution, it first neutralizes the strong acid (HCl), then the weak acid (CH3COOH), and any remaining OH- will determine the pH.

So in this case, after neutralizing HCl's 0.08 mol H+ with 0.08 mol OH-, 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH- remains.

Then, the CH3COOH (0.05 mol) will react with this OH-.

Each CH3COOH can donate one H+, so 0.05 mol OH- will react with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So the final solution has 0.05 mol OH- in 1.2 L.

Therefore, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62, which is option A.

So the correct answer should be A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the neutralization reactions between the acids (HCl and CH₃COOH) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of each component:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
     HCl dissociates completely, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \).
   - **CH₃COOH (weak acid):**  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     CH₃COOH partially dissociates, contributing some \( \text{H}^+ \), but its exact contribution is considered after neutralization.
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Neutralization reactions:**
   - The OH⁻ ions from Ba(OH)₂ react with the H⁺ ions from HCl and CH₃COOH.  
     - First, OH⁻ neutralizes the \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H}^+ \) from HCl:  
       \[
       0.18 \, \text{mol OH}^- - 0.08 \, \text{mol H}^+ = 0.10 \, \text{mol OH}^- \, \text{(remaining)}.
       \]
     - Next, the remaining \( 0.10 \, \text{mol OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH:  
       CH₃COOH donates 1 H⁺ per molecule, so \( 0.05 \, \text{mol CH₃COOH} \) reacts with \( 0.05 \, \text{mol OH}^- \), leaving:  
       \[
       0.10 \, \text{mol OH}^- - 0.05 \, \text{mol OH}^- = 0.05 \, \text{mol OH}^- \, \text{(excess)}.
       \]

3. **Calculate [OH⁻] in the final solution:**
   - The total volume of the solution is \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
     \[
     [\text{OH}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol OH}^-}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M}.
     \]

4. **Calculate pOH and pH:**
   - pOH is given by:  
     \[
     \text{pOH} = -\log [\text{OH}^-] = -\log (0.04167) \approx 1.38.
     \]
   - pH is calculated as:  
     \[
     \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
     \]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**.

Answer: A
