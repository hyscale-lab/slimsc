Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember equilibrium temperature has something to do with how much heat a planet absorbs from its star. I think the formula involves the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. Oh wait, the formula is probably something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. Or wait, maybe it's the inverse square law? Oh right, the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. 

So the equilibrium temperature depends on the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)) * (albedo factor). But wait, albedo is the same for all these planets, so it cancels out when taking the ratio. So I don't have to worry about that part. 

The problem says there are five planets in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, and so on. Because they're in resonance, their periods are in these ratios. 

Since all these planets have circular orbits and are around the same star, their distances from the star should relate to their orbital periods via Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that P² is proportional to a³, right? So P² = a³ * (4π²/(G*M)), but the M is the same for all planets (same star), so a³ is proportional to P². 

Wait, but since the periods are in a ratio, I can find the ratio of their semi-major axes (which is the same as their distances for circular orbits). Let's denote the orbital period ratios as:

P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P5 = 1 : 2 : 2.5 : 3.5 : 5.

So for each planet, a_i is proportional to (P_i)^(2/3). Because a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3). 

Let me write this down. For Planet_2, P2 = 2 * P1. So a2 = a1 * (2)^(2/3). Similarly, Planet_4 has P4 = 3.5 * P1, so a4 = a1 * (3.5)^(2/3).

But I need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The equilibrium temperature inversely depends on the square root of the distance, because T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a). Because T_eq is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^½, which simplifies to sqrt(L/(16πσ a²)) = sqrt(L/(16πσ)) * 1/sqrt(a). So T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(a). 

So the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4) ? Wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T4/T2 = (a2 / a4) ^ (1/2).

Alternatively, let me think again. T_eq = T_star * (R_star/(2 a))^(1/2). So T_eq is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (a2 / a4)^(1/2). Because T4 = (a2/a4)^(1/2) * T2. So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4) ^ 0.5.

Wait, another approach: Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), then T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4). 

So a2 is the distance of Planet_
