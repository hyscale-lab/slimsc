Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, the speed of light in the glassâ€”so normally, when the medium isn't moving, the speed of light is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed in the medium. So speed v_light = c/n. But wait, here the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I remember something about Galilean transformations or maybe the velocity addition formulas. Oh wait, in the case of light, things are different because in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is about glass moving and light in glass. Wait, maybe this is a trick question because of relativity.

Wait, but the problem states "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory." So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v toward the observer. Does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but according to special relativity, the speed of light should still be c regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. So if the glass is moving
