Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions with mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So, the reactions are happening on oct-4-ene, but in different E and Z configurations.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, then aqueous acid.
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, then aqueous acid.

Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

I need to figure out what the HPLC chromatograms will show. The options are about the number of peaks in each.

Hmm, first, what's happening in each reaction. mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that typically epoxidizes alkenes. Epoxidation involves adding an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. But wait, waitâ€”mCPBA is also involved in other reactions, like dihydroxylation when using different conditions, but I think here it's epoxidation because one equivalent is used, and it's followed by aqueous acid. Oh wait, no, dihydroxylation uses something else, and mCPBA is for epoxidation.

Wait, no, when mCPBA is used with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. Then, when treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes acid-catalyzed ring-opening. What happens then? Let me think.

Epoxide ring-opening under acidic conditions: the acid protonates the oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stable. Wait, no, in epoxide ring-opening, under acidic conditions, the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more electrophilic. Or wait, maybe it's the more substituted because the carbocation is more stable? Let me get this straight.

The epoxide oxygen is protonated, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because the transition state leading to the more stable carbocation is favored. So the carbocation that forms is at the
