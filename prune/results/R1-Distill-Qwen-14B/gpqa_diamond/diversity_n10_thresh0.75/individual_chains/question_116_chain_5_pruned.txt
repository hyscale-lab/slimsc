Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what I remember about NMR and reaction mechanisms. 

The question starts with Compound A, which has two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm... I remember that in proton NMR, the splitting can tell us about neighboring protons. A triplet suggests two neighboring protons, and a quartet suggests three. 

So for the triplet at 0.9 ppm, that's usually indicative of a CH2 group attached to something else, maybe a CH2 that's next to another CH2 group. Wait, 6H in total... Maybe it's two CH2 groups, each with three H's. Like, perhaps a (CH2CH3)2 group. Because each CH2CH3 has 3 H's, and two of them would give 6 H's. And the triplet would come from coupling with a neighboring CH2 group. 

Wait, no. Let me think. A triplet in NMR is n+1 where n is the number of neighboring H's. So if it's a triplet, it's next to a group with two H's. So the proton in question is next to a CH2. So a triplet (like a CH2CH2 group) would be for a CH2 next to another CH2. Oh wait, maybe it's a (CH2CH3)2 group. Each CH2CH3 has three H's on the CH2, but wait, that's more like a singlet because the CH2 is attached to the CH3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from a methyl group attached to something. Like, maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group. No, wait. If you have a CH2CH2CH3, the CH2 next to the CH3 would be a quartet, because it's next to a CH3 (3 H's). But wait, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm, which is usually a methyl group attached to something. So maybe it's a (CH2CH3)2CH group. Wait, no, that would have more H's. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the triplet comes
