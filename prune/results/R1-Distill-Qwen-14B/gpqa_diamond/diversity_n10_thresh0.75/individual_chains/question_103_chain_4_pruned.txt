Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

Let me start by breaking down the target molecule. The molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. That means on the benzene ring, there are three substituents: a bromo group at the 3 position, a nitro group at the 5 position, and an acetyl group (since ethan-1-one is an acetyl group) at the 1 position. Wait, actually, I should make sure about the numbering. Oh wait, wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky here. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring. Because the acetyl group is at position 1, the bromo is at 3, and nitro at 5. So the substituents are meta to each other.

So the target molecule has a benzene ring with substituents at the 1,3,5 positions: acetyl (COCH3), bromo (Br), and nitro (NO2). Wait, wait, actually, the numbering might be different. Let me think again. Oh, the substituents are at positions 1,3,5. Because 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl implies that the bromo is at position 3, and nitro at 5, and the acetyl is at position 1.

So the substituents are at positions 1 (acetyl), 3 (bromo), and 5 (nitro). Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so this arrangement is possible.

Now, how do I synthesize this from benzene? I remember that when introducing substituents to benzene, the order matters because of directing effects. For example, nitro groups are meta directors, while acetyl groups (from acetylation) are also meta directors. Bromine is ortho/para, but when introduced as Br2 with FeBr3, it's a electrophilic substitution, so bromine is ortho/
