Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. But wait, the question is about symmetries that all operators must respect.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. I need to pick which of these must be obeyed by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetry? Oh right, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's a bigger symmetry group. But SMEFT is a effective field theory, which typically works in a fixed spacetime background. Effective theories usually don't incorporate gravity, so maybe they don't require Poincare symmetry because that's more related to general relativity and curved spacetime. So operators in SMEFT might not necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry.

Now, Lorentz symmetry. SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so the effective theory should too. So any operator in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalar, meaning they must transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely one that must be respected.

What about CP and CPT symmetry? The Standard Model is approximately CP symmetric, but not CPT. Wait, no, the Standard Model does respect CPT symmetry because all observed particles have their antiparticles with matching properties. But wait, CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. The Standard Model includes CPT symmetry.

But in SMEFT, the operators can include higher-dimension terms that might break some of these symmetries. Wait, no, the SM respects CPT symmetry, so any effective operator must respect it as well, right? Because the SMEFT is built as a low-energy effective theory of the SM, which includes CPT symmetry. So if the SM operators respect CPT, then the SMEFT operators must too.

Wait, but wait. Are all SMEFT operators automatically CPT invariant? Because the SM does it, but if you add higher-dimension operators, they're typically constructed to preserve the same symmetries as the SM. So yes, I think they must respect CPT.

But wait, does SMEFT necessarily respect CP symmetry? The SM doesn't have CP symmetry exactly because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So if the SM already has CP violation, then SMEFT is built on top of that, meaning some operators can violate CP. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, but CPT must hold.

Wait, no. The SM respects CPT symmetry, but not CP. Because the combination CPT is a symmetry, but CP isn't. So in SMEFT, the operators must respect CPT symmetry, but CP symmetry is not necessarily required. So any operator in SMEFT must be CPT-invariant, but they don't have to be CP-invariant.

Wait, but the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator can violate CP, then CP symmetry isn't a must. But CPT must be respected because the SM does?

Wait, no, because higher-dimension operators could potentially break CPT if they don't respect it. But in reality, the SMEFT is constructed to respect the same symmetries
