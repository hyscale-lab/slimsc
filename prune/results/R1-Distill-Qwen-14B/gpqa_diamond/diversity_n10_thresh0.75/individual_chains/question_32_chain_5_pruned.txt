Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC for short. The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me see... Li is lithium, right? So lithium-6 maybe? Because Li typically has 3 protons, adding 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A = 6.

Wait, but when dealing with relativistic particles, we have to consider the relativistic energy. I think the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). 

So first, I need to calculate gamma when v is 0.96c. Let's compute that. The formula for gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me plug in v as 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². Then, 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, let me get more precise with the calculation to avoid mistakes.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, right? Because 0.28 *0.28 = 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is exactly 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Next, I need the rest mass energy of the nucleus. The nucleus is Li-6. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.660539 x 10^-27 kg. But wait, I remember that the rest energy is m c squared, but for particles, we often express energy in GeV. So I should find the mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units and then convert to energy using the conversion factor.

Wait, the mass of Li-6. Let me think. The atomic number Z is 3 for lithium. So the mass number A is 6, so it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 u, and each neutron is about 1.008665 u. So the total mass would be 3*(1.007276) + 3*(1.008665) = let's calculate that. 

3 * 1.007276 = 3.021828. 3 * 1.008665 = 3.025995. Adding those together gives 3.021828 + 3.025995 = 6.047823 u. Hmm, but wait, wait. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because Li-6's actual atomic mass is slightly different, right? Because the binding energy and all that. But for this problem, maybe we can approximate it as 6.047823 u?

Wait, no, maybe I should consider the actual mass of Li-6. Let me think. The standard atomic weight for Li-6 is about 6.0151 atomic mass units. Oh wait, wait. Let me check. No, wait, the exact mass can be found in tables. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the given nucleus X as Li with 3 neutrons. So, the mass would be the sum of protons and neutrons. But maybe I should check this.

Wait, Li has 3 protons. So if it has 3 neutrons, that's 6 nucleons total. So the
