Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally, but if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6, since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The question is about relativistic energy. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, we have to use the relativistic energy equations. Oh right, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy.

So gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can calculate gamma. Let me plug that in. v = 0.96c, so v squared is (0.96)^2 c². Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let me be precise. 3.57142857... Maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714.

But wait, maybe more exact calculation is better. Let me compute 0.96^2 again. 0.96 * 0.96: 96*96 is 9216, so 0.96^2 is 0.9216, correct. So denominator becomes sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28, so yes, gamma is 3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass energy needed. The nucleus is Li-6, so I need the mass of a Li-6 nucleus. Wait, Li has an atomic number of 3, so it's 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass of Li-6 can be found using the mass of a proton, neutron, and electrons? Wait, but for a nucleus, electrons are part of the atom, but in the nucleus itself, we're just considering protons and neutrons. Or wait, in the nucleus, electrons are separate (like in the atom), but when considering the nucleus as a whole, like in nuclear physics, the mass is the sum of protons and neutrons
