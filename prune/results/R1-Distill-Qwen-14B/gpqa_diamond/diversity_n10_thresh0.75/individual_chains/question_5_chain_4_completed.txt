Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. It's about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states with definite values.

Wait, the operator P is given with its components P_x, P_y, P_z. Let me see. Each of these is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So the operator P in the direction n would be a combination of these components. Oh right, because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

The direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so the y-component n_y would be zero. Therefore, the operator P is P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2, I think that the eigenvector is the state with spin-up along direction n.

Wait, muons are spin-1/2 particles, right? So their spin states are two-dimensional. The eigenstates of P·n are spin-up and spin-down along that direction. The eigenvectors for spin-up along n are typically expressed in terms of the angles θ and φ, which specify the direction of n.

But wait, the problem says the direction is in the x-z plane. That means the angle φ is zero or perhaps π, depending on the direction. So n has components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but since it's in x-z, sinθ sinφ must be zero. So either φ=0 or φ=π/2? Wait, x-z plane implies that the projection onto y is zero. So yes, n is (something, 0, something), which makes φ undefined in spherical coordinates. Oh wait, no, maybe φ is zero or π. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the angle φ is the angle in the xy-plane from the x-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then the projection onto y is zero, so φ is 0 or π. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe the direction is given in a different way.

But perhaps I can think of n as (a, 0, b), with a² + b² =1. So n_x = a, n_z = b, n_y =0.

So the operator P is (a P_x + b P_z) multiplied by ħ/2. Let's compute this.

Wait, wait. Let me write down each component matrix:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0,1], [1,0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1,0], [0,-1]]

So each component is (ħ/2) multiplied by these matrices. So when I write P · n, it's n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0, so P =n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So P = (n_x (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] ) + (n_z (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Let me factor out (ħ/2):

P = (ħ/2) [n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So the matrix inside would be:

[n_z, n_x]
[n_x, -n_z]

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

Wait, let me compute that. The first term is n_x times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]. The second term is n_z times [[1,0], [0,-1]], which is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding these gives:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the operator P is (ħ/2) times this matrix.

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector |v> such that P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

( (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] ) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Divide both sides by ħ/2 (assuming ħ/2 is not zero, which it isn't):

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[ n_z*v1 + n_x*v2 ] = v1
[ n_x*v1 - n_z*v2 ] = v2

So writing the equations:

1. (n_z) v1 + (n_x) v2 = v1
2. (n_x) v1 - (n_z) v2 = v2

Let me rearrange these equations.

Equation 1: (n_z - 1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

Equation 2: n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

So equation 1: (n_z -1 ) v1 = -n_x v2 → v1 = [ -n_x v2 ] / (n_z -1 )

Equation 2: n_x v1 = (n_z +1) v2 → v1 = [ (n_z +1) v2 ] / n_x

Set the two expressions for v1 equal:

[ -n_x v2 ]/(n_z -1 ) = [ (n_z +1) v2 ] / n_x

Assuming v2 ≠0 (since if v2=0, then v1 would also be zero, which is trivial and not allowed for a state vector), we can cancel v2:

- n_x / (n_z -1 ) = (n_z +1 ) / n_x

Multiply both sides by n_x (n_z -1 ):

- n_x^2 = (n_z +1)(n_z -1 )

Wait, because (n_z +1)(n_z -1 ) = n_z^2 -1.

So:

- n_x^2 = n_z^2 -1 → n_z^2 + n_x^2 = 1

Which is the condition that n is a unit vector, which it is. So this equation is satisfied automatically. So the equations are consistent.

So going back, let's pick one of the expressions for v1 in terms of v2.

Let me choose equation 1:

v1 = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] v2

Wait, but n_z^2 + n_x^2 =1, so n_x = sqrt(1 -n_z^2 ). Hmm, but perhaps I can parameterize n_z and n_x in terms of an angle theta.

Wait, since n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as ( sinθ, 0, cosθ ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so the direction is along some angle theta in that plane.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Then, equation 1 becomes:

v1 = [ - sinθ ) / ( cosθ -1 ) ] v2

Let me compute the denominator: cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2 )

And the numerator: -sinθ = -2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

v1 = [ (-2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )) / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The negatives cancel, 2 cancels. So,

v1 = [ ( sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) ) / ( sin²(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] v2

= cot(theta/2) v2

So, v1 = cot(theta/2) v2

Let me express the eigenvector as (v1, v2) = [ cot(theta/2) v2, v2 ]

To make it a normalized vector, we need to compute the normalization condition:

|v1|^2 + |v2|^2 =1.

So,

|cot(theta/2)|^2 |v2|^2 + |v2|^2 =1 → |v2|^2 [ |cot(theta/2)|^2 + 1 ] = 1

Hmm, cot(theta/2) squared plus 1 is csc²(theta/2) because 1 + cot²x = csc²x.

So,

|v2|^2 * csc²(theta/2) )=1 → |v2|^2 = sin²(theta/2) → v2 = ± sin(theta/2 )

But let's choose the positive value for simplicity, as we can adjust the phase later.

So,

v2 = sin(theta/2 )

v1 = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

Wait, because cot(theta/2) is cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2), so when multiplied by sin(theta/2), it becomes cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is (v1, v2) = ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

But wait, this is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2, right?

Wait, I think I need to double-check the eigenvalue. The eigenvalue is (ħ/2) times the eigenvalue of the matrix. Since the matrix after factoring out (ħ/2) is [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]], so when we found the eigenvector, the equation was [[n_z, n_x],[n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>, so the eigenvalue is 1.

But our original equation was multiplied by (ħ/2), so the eigenvalue is (ħ/2) * 1 = ħ/2, which matches the question. So this is correct.

So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), up to a phase factor.

Wait, but quantum states are defined up to a phase, so the eigenvectors can be multiplied by any complex number of modulus 1. So the answer could include a phase factor, but in the options, some have 'e^{i phi}' which would account for that.

Looking at the options:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

But wait, option B has theta, not theta/2.

Option D: [sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait a second. The eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But I think I might have made a mistake because the general spin-up state along an arbitrary direction is often written as ( cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ). So phi is the angle in the xy-plane, but in this case, n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero or pi. Wait, n is in the x-z plane, which would mean that phi is zero or pi, but I might have to think about that.

Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so in spherical coordinates, phi is zero or pi. So the angle phi would be either 0 or pi, depending on whether n is in the positive x direction or negative.

So the general eigenvector would be ( e^{-i phi} cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ) or similar, depending on the convention. But in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which ignores the phase.

But option B has e^{i phi} sin(theta), but that's in the second component, and the first component is cos(theta). Hmm, which doesn't match what I got. My result has theta/2, so option C is the one.

But wait, I have to ensure that the eigenvector is of length one. Let's compute the norm:

|cos(theta/2)|^2 + |sin(theta/2)|^2 = cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) =1.

So it's normalized, right.

Wait, but in the question, the operator is P, and the eigenvector is for eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), because in the general case, the eigenvector could have a phase factor. But in the case where the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is 0 or pi, so e^{i phi} would be 1 or -1.

But looking at the options, option C doesn't have a phase factor. So perhaps it's the correct answer.

Wait, but let's check the other options.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)

Hmm, but this would be a vector with both components proportional to ħ, but in our case, the eigenvector is dimensionless because it's a spinor. So option A is unlikely.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

This looks like it's using theta as the polar angle, but my calculation had theta/2. So it's not matching.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Again, the presence of ħ here is confusing. Because the eigenvectors are dimensionless, so if the option has ħ as a factor, that might not be correct. Unless the question is considering some other scaling, but I think eigenvectors are normalized vectors without any ħ factors.

So option C is the one without any ħ, which is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C. But wait, what about the possibility of a global phase factor? Because in quantum mechanics, the phase doesn't matter. So the eigenvector could be multiplied by any complex number of modulus 1, but option C doesn't include that, but option B does. But in option B, the angle is theta, not theta/2.

Hmm, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the eigenvector in terms of the direction vector (n_x, n_z). So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), as I thought earlier. So the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is spin-up along direction n.

Alternatively, another way to write this is using the components of the spinor in terms of the direction angles theta and phi.

In the standard basis, the spin-up state along n is:

|+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) | -z>

But in this case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero or pi. So if phi is zero, the state becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). If phi is pi, it becomes (cos(theta/2), - sin(theta/2)).

But in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which doesn't include the phase e^{i phi}, but perhaps in this case, phi is zero, so it's correct.

Alternatively, if the direction is in the x-z plane, but the exact direction can vary, then the eigenvectors can have a phase factor. But the options don't seem to account for that except option B, which includes e^{i phi}.

But the question says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, as it's the standard form for the spin-up state along any direction.

Wait, but wait—no. The general spin-up state along a direction n with spherical angles theta and phi is:

|+n> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) |–z>

Which can be written as ( e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) )

In our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is either 0 or pi (since it's in the x-z plane, the projection along y is zero).

So if phi is 0, then the state is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

If phi is pi, then the state would be ( cos(theta/2) e^{-i pi/2}, sin(theta/2) e^{i pi/2} ) = ( -i cos(theta/2), i sin(theta/2) )

But this doesn't match any of the options except option B, but option B's components are cos(theta) and e^{i phi} sin(theta). So perhaps the correct normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), which is not exactly any of the options except option C, which lacks the phase.

But looking at the options, option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which seems to have a theta rather than theta/2.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait another thing: the operator P is along n, which is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), so the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The spin-up state's components are (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ), but since phi is zero here, it becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to 2x2 matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the $P_y$ component does not contribute, and the operator $\vec{P}$ simplifies to $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

The matrix representation of $P$ is:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation for $P$ is:

\[
P |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector. Substituting $P$ into the eigenvalue equation and solving for the eigenvector, we find that the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$ is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
e^{i\phi} \sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle $\phi$ is either $0$ or $\pi$, depending on the direction of $\vec{n}$. For simplicity, we take $\phi = 0$, so the eigenvector becomes:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as it satisfies the condition $|\cos(\theta/2)|^2 + |\sin(\theta/2)|^2 = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
  This option is incorrect because the eigenvector is dimensionless, and the presence of $\hbar$ is inconsistent with the standard form of spinor components.

- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
  This option is incorrect because the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ are not consistent with the derived eigenvector. The correct angles are $\theta/2$ and $\phi/2$.

- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This option matches the derived eigenvector exactly when $\phi = 0$. It is the correct normalized eigenvector.

- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
  This option is incorrect because the eigenvector is dimensionless, and the presence of $\hbar$ is inconsistent with the standard form of spinor components.

### Final Answer:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.

Answer: C
