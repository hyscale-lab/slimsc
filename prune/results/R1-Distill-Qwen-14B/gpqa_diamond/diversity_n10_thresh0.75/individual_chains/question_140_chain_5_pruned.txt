Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. Then when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, another reaction involving a keto acid and X produces a product with two oxygen atoms. The task is to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

First, I need to figure out what each of these substances could be. Let's start with the gas W. It says W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, each proton and neutron count is the same for the molecule. So the molecule must be something like H2O? No, wait. Let me think. Wait, H2O has two atoms, so each would have a proton and neutron. No, wait, H2O's molecule is H2O, which has two H and one O. That can't be it because O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in most cases, but each H has one. So let's see, the molecule should have equal protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, because CO2 has 2 O's, but the molecule's total protons and neutrons? Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's think about the gas W. If it's H2, then each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron? No, hydrogen usually has one proton and maybe a neutron. But H2 would have two H atoms, each with 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons: 2, total neutrons: 2. So that matches the same number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Wait, but the molecule would be H2, so each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium maybe?), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe W is CH4? No, that doesn't fit. Or maybe W is something like NH3? Let me calculate. NH3 has 1 N and 3 H. Nitrogen has 7 protons, 7 neutrons (since its atomic number is 7, and assuming it's N-14). Each H has 1 proton and
