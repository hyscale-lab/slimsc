Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure in my mind. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and it's attached to the cyclohexane at carbon 2. So that would be an isopropenyl group, right? So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

First reaction: treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride (NaH) is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. It's usually used to deprotonate alcohols, amines, or other acidic protons to form their conjugate bases. Then, when benzyl bromide is added, it's an alkylation agent. So maybe a benzyl group is being added here.

Wait, the starting material has a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH). NaH would deprotonate the -OH to form an alkoxide. Then, adding benzyl bromide (which is an alkylating agent) would probably perform an SN2 reaction. The alkoxide would attack the benzyl bromide, leading to substitution. So the hydroxymethyl group would become a benzyl ether? Like, the oxygen would have a benzyl group attached. So the -CH2OH becomes -CH2-O-Bn (Bn is benzyl). So product 1 would be 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one.

Wait, but another possibility is that the prop-1-en-2-yl might undergo some reaction. The prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2)..., no, wait. The structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-). Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2? I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the formula for prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane at the middle carbon. So it's an isopropenyl group, right? So that's a substituent that's a vinyl group attached in a way that might allow for some conjugate addition or some other reaction. But in this first step, I don't think that's involved. The reaction is with NaH and benzyl bromide,
