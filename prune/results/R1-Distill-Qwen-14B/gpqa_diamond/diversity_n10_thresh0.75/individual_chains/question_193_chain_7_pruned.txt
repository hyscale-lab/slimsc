Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(parallax)^5. Then it's asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are from A to D, each suggesting a different power law.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, actually, parallax is in arcseconds and distance in parsecs, so the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So the number of stars N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down. N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplify that. 1/(1/d)^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So what's the relation between N and distance? If N is proportional to d^5, then what's the rate of change of N with respect to d? Because we're looking for how N changes as r (distance) increases by a unit.

Wait, the number of stars over a range of distance. So if the number of stars is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be like 4πd² dr times some density term. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let me think differently. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So N increases with d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then as d increases, N increases as the fifth power. But wait, perhaps the question is about the density or the number per unit volume, but I'm not sure.
