Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each a different power of r.

Hmm. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax in astronomy is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star is closer, it has a larger parallax, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller. The formula I recall is that distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by the parallax (in arcseconds). So plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx.

Wait, but the problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. So I need to express this in terms of distance and then see how the number of stars per unit distance changes.

Let me write that down. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, we get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, so it's the number per unit distance, which is like the derivative of N with respect to d. Because if you have N proportional to d^5, then the change in N per unit change in d would be proportional to d^4, since the derivative of d^5 is 5d^4. But wait, maybe I should model it more carefully.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential elements. Let's say the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d + dd is N = k * (1/plx^5) * (volume element?), but wait, no. Wait, the problem says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So perhaps it's N ∝ 1/plx^5, but the number of stars in a certain region, which might be a volume.

Wait,
