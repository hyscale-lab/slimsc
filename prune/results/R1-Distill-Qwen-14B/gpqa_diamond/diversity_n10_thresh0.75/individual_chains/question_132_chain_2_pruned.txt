Okay, let's try to figure out this NMR problem. So, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C10H14 for both, which probably means each is a substituted benzene with methyl groups or something similar.

The NMR data says there are two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, 1:1 ratio for the signals? Hmm, so each aromatic compound contributes one singlet, and they're equal in intensity. That suggests each has a simple aromatic region with equivalent protons, maybe para-substituted or something symmetric. Because if they were more complex, like ortho or meta, you might see more splitting.

Then, there are three signals at around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. The 2.2 ppm region is usually for methyl groups attached to something, like CH3 next to an oxygen or a benzene ring. Since all are singlets, each group is probably in a symmetric position so their protons don't split each other. The 2:1:1 ratio implies three different types of methyl groups, but the first one is twice as intense as the others. Wait, maybe two equivalent methyl groups and two single ones?

Wait, but each compound has multiple methyl groups. Let me look at the options given. The options are four different compounds:

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, let me think about each structure.

So, the first compound is 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. That would have four methyl groups. Wait, benzene has six carbons. 1,2,4,5 positions would be in a way that maybe the substituents are across each other. Let me visualize it: positions 1,2,4,5 would make a structure where each adjacent pair is a methyl, but spaced out. Wait, 1 and 2 are adjacent, 4 and 5 are adjacent. So maybe it's something like meta substitution on either side.

Alternatively, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have methyl groups on four consecutive positions. Like 1,2,3,4, so that's a para-substituted ring with four substituents, but I'm not sure. Hmm, maybe that's a bit crowded, but possible.

Another option, 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: methyl groups at 1,2,3,5. So positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, and 5 is across from 2 or something. Wait, maybe that's like three methyl groups adjacent on one side and another one across.

Wait, but all the options are tetramethylbenzenes except option C, which has 1,4-diethylbenzene. So option C includes a diethyl substituent, which would have two ethyl groups in the para positions. Let me consider that.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Each compound has C10H14. So for tetramethylbenzene, benzene has 6 C, so tetramethyl would add 4*1=4 C (since each methyl is CH3). So 6+4=10, which fits. So the tetramethyl compounds each have C10H14.

So for 1,4-diethylbenzene, the structure would have two ethyl groups on the benzene ring in para positions. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two would add 4 C and 10 H. Benzene has 6 C, so total is 6+4=10 C, as needed. The H count: benzene is 6 H. Each ethyl has 5 H (since they're attached via CH2). Two ethyls would add 2*(5) =10 H. So total of 6+10=16 H? But the molecular formula is C10H14. Wait
