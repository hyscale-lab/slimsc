Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right! The parallax of a star (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to its distance from us. So a star with a larger parallax is closer, and a smaller parallax is farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? Oh, maybe in space, so their actual density is uniform. So the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

But wait, when we observe them, we're seeing them with varying distances. So how does that affect the number we count in different parallax ranges?

Let me think about the relationship between parallax (p), distance (d), and the number of stars. Parallax is p = 1/d (in parsecs). So d = 1/p.

If the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is the same throughout. So in a shell between distance d and d + dd, the volume is the surface area (4π d²) times dd. The number of stars in that shell would be the number density (n, a constant) multiplied by the volume: n * 4π d² dd.

But we need to express this in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/p, dd would be - (1/p²) dp, right? Because differentiating d = 1/p gives dd = -1/p² dp.
