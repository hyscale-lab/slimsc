Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a certain concentration of a Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem states that the concentration of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Oh wait, the term 'stoichiometric' means that the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1, right? Because Ca typically forms a 1:1 complex with EDTA. So the complex is Ca-EDTA.

The pH is ideal, which I think implies that the EDTA is in its correct deprotonated form to form the complex. So pH isn't a complicating factor here. The temperature is 25Â°C, which is standard, so maybe that's not an issue either.

The given K value is 5x10^10. I think that's the formation constant, Kf, for the Ca-EDTA complex. Formation constant tells us how much the complex will form; a large K means the complex is stable and will form mostly.

So I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. The formula for the formation constant is Kf = [Ca-EDTA]/([Ca][EDTA]). But wait, since the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and assuming that initially, the EDTA and Ca are only present as
