Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the EDTA's form or anything. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. I remember that K is the formation constant, right?

Wait, so the Ca-EDTA complex is [CaEDTA]^2-. Because EDTA usually has a 4- charge, but when it complexes with Ca^2+, it's a 2- charge? Or wait, no, the overall charge depends on the metal and the EDTA. Let me think: EDTA is a hexadentate ligand. So when it complexes with Ca^2+, which is a divalent metal, the complex would have a charge of (EDTA^4- minus 2 from Ca^2+), so 2- overall. So the formula is CaY^2- where Y is EDTA.

The problem wants the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca^2+], in the solution. Because the EDTA is complexing the Ca, the free ion concentration will be low, right?

I think the formation constant (Kf) is given here as 5e10. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this solution, the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M, assuming it's all complexed. But wait, is there any uncomplexed Ca^2+ or EDTA left? Well, given that the K is very large (5e10), the complex is very stable, so almost all the Ca^2+ is complexed, and [Ca^2+] is very low.

So let's model this. Let me denote the total concentration of Ca as the sum of free Ca^2+ and the complexed form. So:

Total Ca = [Ca^2+] + [CaEDTA^2-] ≈ [CaEDTA^2-] because the free [Ca^2+] is negligible. Because K is so large, the majority is complexed, so the free [Ca^2+] is much less than the total.

But wait, the problem says the solution is 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the total Ca is 0.02 M because each complex has one Ca^2+.

So the initial setup is:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, where does the EDTA come from? Because the problem states that the solution has the complex, which implies that EDTA is present in excess. Or wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all the EDTA is in the complex form? No, because the complex requires both Ca and EDTA.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total EDTA. Let me think again. Let me define:

Total EDTA is [EDTA^4-] + [CaEDTA^2-]. But if the EDTA is in excess, maybe [EDTA^4-] is approximately constant, but wait, I don't know the total EDTA concentration.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the EDTA is in excess, and thus [EDTA] is approximately equal to the initial concentration of EDTA minus that used in the complex. But wait, without knowing how much EDTA was added, I can't proceed that way.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again. The total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. The Kf is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, so the reaction favors the product.

So let's write the equilibrium expression:

Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4-] )

We can rearrange this to solve for [Ca^2+]:

[Ca^2+] = [CaEDTA^2-] / ( Kf * [EDTA^4-] )

But I don't know [EDTA^4-]. How can I find that?

Wait, maybe I can assume that the EDTA is in excess, so that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the initial [EDTA] minus the amount used to form the complex. But without knowing the initial [EDTA], I can't proceed. Hmm.
