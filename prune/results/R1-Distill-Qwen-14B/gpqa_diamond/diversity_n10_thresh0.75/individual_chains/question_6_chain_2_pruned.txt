Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Hmm, the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I remember that in such problems, the potential often leads to a specific form of energy levels, probably involving some quantum numbers.

Wait, the potential looks a bit complicated. Let me try to break it down. The first part is (1/2)k r², which reminds me of the potential for a harmonic oscillator in two dimensions. But the second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh, right, in polar coordinates, r is the radial distance, and θ is the angular part. So maybe this potential can be separated into radial and angular parts? Or perhaps it's separable in some other way.

Wait, I remember that for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the potential is usually something like (1/2)mω² r², but in this case, the potential seems a bit different. Also, the angular part complicates things. Let me think about how potentials affect the energy levels.

So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor out (1/2)k r². So that would be (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² (1 + 3 cos²θ). 

Wait, but perhaps I can separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Let's see. The radial part is (1/2)k r², and the angular part is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. But wait, r² is a function of the radial distance only, so the angular part depends on θ. So the potential can be written as V(r,θ) = V_r(r) + V_θ(θ), because each term depends only on r and θ respectively. But wait, no. Wait, V_r would be the part that depends only on r, which is (1/2)k r², and V_θ is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh wait, but the angular term is multiplied by r², which complicates things because r is a radial coordinate. So maybe the potential isn't separable in the usual r and θ sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a coordinate transformation. Because sometimes, potentials that are functions of cosθ can be handled by using a different angular variable. For instance, maybe using the double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me try that substitution.

So, V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ] = (1/2) k r² + (3/4)k r² (1 + cos 2θ).

Hmm, so that becomes (1/2 + 3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ. Simplifying the constants: 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 + 3/4 = 5/4. So 5/4 k r² + (3/4)k r² cos 2θ. So V(r,θ) = (5k r²)/4 + (3k r² cos 2θ)/4. 

Hmm, that might not seem immediately helpful, but wait. Another approach: perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of a shifted angular coordinate. Since the angular part is cos 2θ, maybe that suggests a coordinate system where the potential is more symmetric. Alternatively, think about the potential in terms of polar coordinates but with a different angular variable.

Wait, another thought: maybe this potential can be expressed as a combination of two harmonic oscillators. Because, for a 2D harmonic oscillator, the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which leads to energy levels E = (n_x + n_y + 1) ℏ ω, where ω = sqrt(k/m), since the potential is (1/2)k r². But wait, the potential here is more complex.

Wait, the given potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Let me factor r²:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. 

Hmm, another approach: perhaps using the fact that in polar coordinates,
