Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of product 4 after a series of reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on some of these mechanisms.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me draw that in my mind. So, cyclohexanone ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH. And at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2CHCH2 but attached at the double bond. Oh wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent would be -CH2-C(=CH2)- attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl would be the structure where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So, the structure would be CH2-C(=CH2)- attached? Or maybe it's -CH(CH2CH2) with a double bond? Wait, maybe I should think of prop-1-en-2-yl as isopropenyl. Like, the group is CH2=C(CH3)-. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)= attached. No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2- attached to the cyclohexane as a substituent. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again: prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. Because the substituent is on C2, so the group is CH2-CH(CH2)- but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me write it down. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is the group attached at C2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C(CH2R)-, but wait, I'm getting this wrong. Oh, wait, prop-1-en-
