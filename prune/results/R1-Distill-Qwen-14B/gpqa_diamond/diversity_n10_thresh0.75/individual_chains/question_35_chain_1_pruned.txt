Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, denoted as A_y. It's given as A_y = c · S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and see which statement among the options is correct.

Hmm, first, let's write down what the matrix S looks like. So S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

And since c = h/(4π), the matrix A_y is c multiplied by S. So:

A_y = (h/(4π)) * S = [ (h/(4π)) * 0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
                     [ (h/(4π))*i      (h/(4π))*0 ]

So that simplifies to:

[ 0          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)    0         ]

Wait, but I think I can factor out h/(4π) to make it easier. So each element is c times the corresponding S element.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

The matrix (A_y - λ I) is:

[ -λ        (-i h/(4π)) ]
[ (i h/(4π))   -λ      ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) )(i h/(4π)) ) = λ² - [ (i)(-i) (h/(4π))² ].

Wait, let's compute that. The term ( (-i h/(4π)) ) multiplied by (i h/(4π)) is (-i)(i) * (h/(4π))². 

What's (-i)(i)? I know that i * i is -1. So (-i)(i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is 1 * (h/(4π))². 

So the determinant becomes λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So solving λ² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check the calculation again. The cross terms: in the determinant, it's (top right) * (bottom left) minus (top left) * (bottom right). Wait no, the determinant is (a*d - b*c) for a 2x2 matrix [[a,b],[c,d]]. So in this case, a is (-λ), d is (-λ), b is (-i h/(4π)), and c is (i h/(4π)).

So determinant is ( (-λ)*(-λ) ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

Which is λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h^2/(16 π²)) ]
