Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the Bragg equation or some formula involving lattice parameters and Miller indices.

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral. Oh right, rhombohedral means all the lattice parameters are equal, a = b = c, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are equal too. In this case, they're all 30 degrees. Oh wait, no, 30 degrees seems really small. Wait, no, maybe 30 degrees is correct. I've heard that in a rhombohedral structure, the angles can be different from 90 degrees. So the unit cell isn't cubic but rhombohedral.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait a second. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be the lattice parameter a. But here, it's a rhombohedral structure. So I think the lattice parameter 'a' is the same as the interatomic distance. Because in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corners, so the distance between adjacent atoms is a. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, it's a bit more complex. Maybe the interatomic distance isn't the same as 'a'? Or am I mixing it up with other crystal systems?

Wait, no, in a simple cubic, the atoms are at the cube corners, so the edge is 'a' and the distance between nearest neighbors is 'aâˆš3' if it's face-centered or something else. Wait no, wait. Simple cubic has nearest neighbor distance of 'a' because each corner atom is connected to the adjacent corners along the cube edges. So for simple cubic, the nearest neighbor distance is a. So in this problem, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so a is 10 Angstrom.

But wait, the structure is rhombohedral, which is a type of cubic system where a = b = c, but angles are not 90 degrees. So yes, a is 10 Angstrom.

Now, I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a/(sqrt( (h^2)/(
