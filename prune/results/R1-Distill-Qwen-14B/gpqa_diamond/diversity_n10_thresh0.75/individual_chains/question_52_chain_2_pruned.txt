Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

Okay, the question talks about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Interesting, so the presence of spots is making the star cooler overall.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They said that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I'm supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Hmm. So the ratio N1/N2 of Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, N1/N2 is higher than when spots are present. The question is asking for the factor, which would be (N1/N2)_no_spots divided by (N1/N2)_with_spots.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about why the ratio changes. Oh, right, this has to do with the Saha equation and the Boltzmann equation because we're dealing with populations of energy levels in a stellar atmosphere under LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium).

In LTE, the number of atoms in different energy levels depends on the temperature. The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of populations of two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is something like N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Since the question is about the ratio of N1/N2, which is the inverse of that. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But wait, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Angstroms. Since wavelength λ is related to energy by E = hc/λ. The energy difference between the two levels is E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So, I need to find the ratio of (N1/N2) when Teff is 6000 K (no spots) to when Teff is 5500
