Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, maybe in the Hofmann degradation or something similar. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used for the reaction called the Clemmensen reduction, right? Oh wait, no, Clemmensen is with Zn(Hg)/HCl, right? Red phosphorus and HI might be for something else. Oh wait, I think when you have an alkyne and treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it's the hydrolysis of the alkyne to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction for an elimination or substitution. Hmm, I need to figure that out.

But before that, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data. Let me look at the IR first.

The IR data shows a strong peak around 3400-2500 cm⁻¹. That broad region usually suggests either O-H (like in alcohols or acids) or N-H (amines), or maybe even C-H stretching for alkenes. But the 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is a strong indicator. That's a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3000 cm⁻¹, and their carbonyl is around 1700. So maybe the 1720 is an ester or a ketone.

Looking at the IR, there's also a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Now the 1H NMR. Let's break it down.

The NMR has several signals:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) – that's a singlet, broad. Could be an O-H proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because in NMR, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm, broad because
