Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I need to figure out the structure of Compound X based on the given IR and NMR data, and then determine what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, let's take this step by step.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid because those typically show a broad peak in that region. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which makes me think of a carbonyl group. Carboxylic acids have that around 1700 cm-1. Also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those might be C=C stretches, possibly from an aromatic ring, which would suggest the compound is an aromatic acid, like a benzoic acid derivative.

Now the 1H NMR data. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet, broad or sharp. That's a strong indicator of a -COOH proton. The next peaks are at 8.0 ppm (doublet, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (doublet, 2H). Those look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring because the splitting is into two doublets for the two sets of protons. So maybe it's a 4-substituted benzene, like a para-substituted benzoic acid.

Then, at 2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H), 1.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H), 1.4 ppm (doublet, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (triplet, 3H). These are more like alkyl chain protons. Let me think: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably a CH2CH2CH3 group. The triplet comes from the CH2 next to the CH3. The 1.4 ppm doublet could be a CH(CH2CH3)2 or maybe a branching point. Wait, let me draw this out.

The multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H) might be a CH connected to two different groups, like a CH that's part of a branch. The 1.7 ppm is another set of two protons, perhaps adjacent to that branching. Oh, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a CH.

Putting this together, the substituent on the benzene ring is a chain that looks like a propyl or butyl group. Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H. Oh, wait, that's a methyl group adjacent to a CH group. So perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Because in a sec-butyl, you have CH(CH2CH3)2. Let me see: the structure would be something like benzene with a substituent that includes a propionyl group attached.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. So the molecule is a benzoic acid with some substituents. So, the structure is likely para-substituted. The substituent is a butyl group? Let me think about the NMR signals.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). The downfield shift suggests that the substituent is an electron-withdrawing group, which fits with a carboxylic acid. Benzoic acid derivatives usually have the ring protons deshielded, especially in the para position.

The substituent's NMR signals:

The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is a terminal CH3, likely part of a longer chain. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH. The multiplet at 1.7 (2H) could be CH2 next to a CH and another group. The multiplet at
