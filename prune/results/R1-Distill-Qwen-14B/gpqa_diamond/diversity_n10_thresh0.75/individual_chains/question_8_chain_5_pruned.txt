Okay, so I've got this genetics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is about an experiment with white lupine plants and their resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They've identified three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They created knock-out mutants for each (g1, g2, g3) and also double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The goal is to figure out how these genes interact based on the resistance levels shown in the mutants.

The important thing to remember is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor that acts upstream of another gene. Transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes, so if one is a TF, its activity might influence the others.

The data they have are the resistance percentages. The control is 100% resistance, so any mutant with lower than that is more susceptible. The data are:

- g1: 75% (so 25% susceptibility)
- g2: 0% (so 100% susceptible)
- g3: 50% (50% susceptible)
- g1g3: 10% (so 90% susceptible)
- g2g3: 0% (100% susceptible)
- g1g2: 0% (100% susceptible)

Hmm. So, first I need to figure out what each of these results tells us about the relationships between the genes.

Looking at single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance, which is the same as the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3). So when g2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is essential for resistance. Also, since it's a transcription factor, maybe G2 activates other genes necessary for resistance.

g1 has 75% resistance, so it's less than wild type but still some resistance. g3 has 50% resistance.

Now the double mutants: 

g1g2 is 0%, which is the same as g2 alone. Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So when you have g2 and another gene knocked out, you still get 0% resistance. That suggests that the presence of g2 knockout masks the effect of the other mutations. 

What's the implication of that? Well, if knocking out g2 completely eliminates resistance, then perhaps G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, it might activate G1 and G3. If G2 isn't working, then neither are G1 and G3, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but how about g1g3? Their resistance is 10%, which is lower than either g1 (75%) or g3 (50%). So when both g1 and g3 are knocked out, the resistance drops much more. That suggests that G1 and G3 might be working in the same pathway or perhaps redundantly.

Let me think about epistasis here. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of B is only seen when A is functional.

If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then perhaps G2 activates both G1 and G3. So in the single mutants, g2 can't activate anything, so resistance is 0%. But in the other single mutants, g1 and g3, perhaps their products are part of the downstream pathway initiated by G2.

Wait, but wait. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would mean G1 and G3 aren't expressed. But in the data, the single mutants g1, g3 are still present, so that can't be right. Or maybe they are not directly regulated by G2.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates a gene that is required for both G1 and G3 function. Hmm, or maybe G2 activates another gene that's necessary for their function.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is the only one that's a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are target genes that it activates. So without G2, G1 and G3 aren't active, leading to no resistance. But the single mutants g1 and g3 have some resistance, which suggests that their products are not essential, or that they have partial function even without G2.

Wait, maybe
