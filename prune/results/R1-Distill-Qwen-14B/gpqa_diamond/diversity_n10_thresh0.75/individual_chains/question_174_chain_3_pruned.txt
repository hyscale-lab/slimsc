Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

An atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We're supposed to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm, okay, so the initial nucleus is at rest, which means the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since momentum is conserved, the total momentum after fission should be zero as well.

Let's denote the masses of the two fragments. Let me think: the problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So let's call the smaller mass m. Then the larger would be 2m. Wait, but the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m + 2m = 0.99 M. That means 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M. Therefore, the two fragments have masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M.

Wait, but wait a second. The initial nucleus has rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. So the rest mass M is 300 GeV / cÂ². But when the nucleus splits, the total rest mass of the fragments is 0.99 M, which is less than M. So there must be some mass defect, which would be converted into kinetic energy, right?

So the initial rest energy is 300 GeV. The rest energy of the fragments is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the mass defect is 3 GeV. That energy would be converted into kinetic energy of the two fragments.

But wait, in reality, the kinetic energy comes from the binding energy released. So the total kinetic energy of both fragments would be 3 GeV. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about that, because in nuclear reactions,
