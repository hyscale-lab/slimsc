Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, which are infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities aren't physical, so regularization helps make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the divergences.

So, thinking about each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. It's a theory where particles are not point-like but rather tiny strings. I remember that string theory might not have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because strings vibrate at different modes, and the theory incorporates higher dimensions. Wait, but I also recall that string theories like Type I have certain issues with divergences, but maybe they don't require the same kind of regularization as others. Or perhaps string theories are finite? Wait, no, I think they still have some divergences but are handled differently, maybe through the concept of T-duality or using different mathematical frameworks. But I'm not entirely sure if they never require regularization.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD has a property called asymptotic freedom, meaning that the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies (or short distances). But wait, at low energies, the theory becomes strongly coupled, leading to things like confinement. However, when it comes to regularization, QCD calculations often require it because of divergent loop integrals. For example, when calculating things like beta functions or other loop corrections, you need to regularize the integrals. So QCD does require regularization techniques like dimensional regularization or lattice regularization. So this option is probably not the correct answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. I remember that QED is a renormalizable theory, which means that after using techniques like renormalization, you can eliminate the infinities. But renormalization often goes hand in hand with regularization. Without regularization, you can't really perform renormalization because the divergences are too problematic. So QED definitely requires regularization. So C is not the answer.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. This is the non-quantum version, Maxwell's equations and all that. In classical theories, you don't have the same kind of infinities as in quantum field theories because you're not dealing with virtual particles or loop corrections. So in classical E&M, you don't have divergent integrals in the same way, so you wouldn't need regularization. But wait, wait. Are there any infinities in classical electrodynamics? For example, the self-energy of a charge or the fields at a point charge (like a point electron) can lead to infinite fields. But in classical theory, these are handled by different methods, like the method of images or by using distributions (Dirac deltas), but I don't think you need regularization in the same sense as in quantum field theory. So perhaps classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences that quantum theories do. Or does it? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but the question is about which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So when energies are high, in quantum theories, divergences become more of an issue because you're probing shorter distances, leading to higher momentum integrals that can diverge. So high energies usually correspond to short wavelengths and thus higher momentum space integrals, which can go to infinity. So in quantum theories, you need regularization. But classical theories aren't affected the same way because they don't calculate loop integrals the same way.

So looking back, the options are A to D. The question is which theory doesn't need regularization. So D is classical electrodynamics. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't require regularization because it doesn't have the same divergences that quantum theories have. But wait, do any of the quantum theories not require regularization?

Wait, superstring theory is a quantum theory, a theory of quantum gravity perhaps. But does it require regularization? Because string theories might have different ways of handling divergences. I recall that in string theory, the perturbative expansion is in terms of string diagrams, and perhaps the divergences are tamed by the theory's structure. Or maybe in certain formulations, like the Green-Schwarz mechanism, they handle anomalies, which are a form of divergence, but that's more about ensuring consistency rather than regularization.

Alternatively, perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's a
