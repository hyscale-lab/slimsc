Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the molecular formula from these data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, this compound probably has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but looking further, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a strong peak that often corresponds to carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe something else like an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but since the peak is strong, maybe another carbonyl. Wait, but 1700 is more typical for a ketone or aldehyde, or maybe an ester or acid. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an amide, but that's less likely here since the options don't have nitrogen.

Wait, wait. Another thought: 1700 and 1650 could also be due to two different carbonyl groups in the molecule, but that seems a bit less likely. Or maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring. Let me think. An aromatic ring (like in a benzene ring) might have absorption around 1600 cm⁻¹, but 1650 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has two carbonyls? Or perhaps one is from a ketone and the other is an ester. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. Aromatic rings can have peaks around 1600, but sometimes they're higher if they're conjugated or in a different environment.

Wait, another possibility: the 1700 could be an ester,
