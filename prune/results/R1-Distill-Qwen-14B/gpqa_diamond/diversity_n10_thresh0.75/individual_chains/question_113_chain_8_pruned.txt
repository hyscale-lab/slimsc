Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbon atoms but varying hydrogens and oxygens.

First, I'll go through each piece of data one by one and see what each tells me about the structure.

The first clue is the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. The broadness suggests it's not an aliphatic O-H because those are usually less broad or maybe more, but wait, actually, alcohols have broad O-H, but carboxylic acids have even broader ones. Hmm, but then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. 

The 1700 region is a strong peak, which makes me think of carbonyl groups. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe even a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak is another carbonyl maybe? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, which could show a peak around there. Or maybe an amide or something else.

Wait, but wait. 1700 is a typical carbonyl, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, like in a ketone such as acetophenone, or maybe an ester group where the carbonyl is slightly lower. Alternatively, if there are two carbonyl groups, but that seems less likely. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is a conjugated double bond. Let me think.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the protons on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has at least one double bond. So maybe an alkene is present.

Also, the mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a significant mass. Let me think about what fragments give that. 45 is the molecular weight of a fragment. Possible fragments include CH3CHO (30? No, wait, that's more like 44). Or maybe a
