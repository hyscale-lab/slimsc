Okay, so I have this question about genetics and barley cultivars. Let's see what it's about. The problem is about a drought-resistant barley plant that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the idea is that if the gene is not functional, the compound won't be made. So, they're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. I need to figure out which one is the most likely to cause a nonfunctional gene product.

First, let's compare the sequences. The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’, and each mutant has a change in the first part.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
I see that in the first part, the third nucleotide is different. Let's count. The intact gene's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT… So the third codon is TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant 1's sequence is ATG TTT [but wait, looking at the string: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… Hmm, maybe I should look for where the changes are. Let me count the letters.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for the exact spot where the change occurs. Let me write out the first few codons.

Intact gene: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG C... Wait, wait: the mutant1 sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… So let's break it down:

Original:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ...

Mutant1:
ATG TTT CT ACG C... Wait, maybe the third codon is different. Let me see:

Original first few bases: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT… 

Mutant1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC… 

So the first 10 nucleotides: Intact is ATG TTT CTC..., Mutant1 is ATG TTT CTA CGC ... Wait:

Wait,
