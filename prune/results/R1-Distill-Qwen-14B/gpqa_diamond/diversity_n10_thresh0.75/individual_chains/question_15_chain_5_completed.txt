Okay, so I've got this problem about exoplanets and transit probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about which planet has a higher chance of transiting, so the researchers can maximize their observing time. Both planets are Earth-like, detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. They have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. The host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, but since their radii are the same, that probably doesn't affect the transit probability directly.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the sizes of the star and the planet's orbit. Specifically, the transit probability is higher when the star is smaller or when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. But wait, since the planets' orbital planes are randomly oriented, the probability depends mainly on the system's geometry.

The formula I recall for the transit probability (P) is P = (R_p / a) * (1 + R_p / a), where R_p is the planet's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, no, no, I think that's not exactly right. Let me think again. Oh right, the transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) and the star's radius (R_s), but I'm probably mixing terms. Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is (R_p + R_s) / a. No, that doesn't seem right either.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) is given by R*/a, where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think: the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is proportional to (R*/a)^2 or something like that. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_p / a) * (R_p / a + ... hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_*/ a), where R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So if a is smaller, the probability is higher because the planet is closer in, so its orbit is more likely to cross our line of sight. But wait, that's not correct because a is larger when the planet is farther away. So if a is smaller (closer-in planet), the probability is higher.

Wait, actually, the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a)². Because it's based on the solid angle. The area of the star as seen from Earth compared to the area of the planet's orbital plane. Or maybe it's just R_*/a multiplied by something else. Alternatively, I think the formula is P = (R_*/a) * ( (R_*/a) + 1 ), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the probability being proportional to (R_*/a)². Because the transit happens when the planet's path in front of the star is within the small circle (from our perspective), the area of which is π (R_p + R_*)², but perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is (R_*/a) multiplied by (R_p + R_*) / a, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the probability is (R_p / a) multiplied by (R_p / a + something). Hmm, maybe I should look for a standard formula.

Wait, I just thought of another approach: the probability that a planet transits is roughly (R_*/a), where R_* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. So if a is small (the planet is close to the star), the probability is higher.

But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Another way: the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance between the star and the planet. So higher when the star is smaller and/or the planet is closer (smaller a).

In this problem, both host stars have the same radius. So R_* is the same for both. So the probability depends on a: the semi-major axis.

Wait, but wait—what determines the semi-major axis? Because a is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. And Kepler's law says that (a^3)/(T^2) = (G(M_* + M_p))/(4π²). But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate it as a^3 = (G M_*) T^2 / (4π²). So for the same M_*, T is proportional to a^(3/2). But in our case, the two planets have different host star masses and different orbital periods.

Wait, in the problem: Planet_1 has an orbital period that's three times shorter than Planet_2. So T1 = T2 / 3.

The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. So M1 = 2 M2.

So using Kepler's third law: a^3 = (G M_* T^2) / (4π²).

So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_* * T^2)^(1/3).

So, a1 is proportional to (M1 * T1^2)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (T2/3)^2) )^(1/3).

Which is (2 M2 * T2² / 9 )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) M2 T2² )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) )^(1/3) * (M2 T2² )^(1/3).

But for Planet_2, a2 is proportional to (M2 * T2^2)^(1/3).

So the ratio a1 / a2 would be ( (2/9)^(1/3) ) * ( (M2 T2^2 )^(1/3) ) / ( (M2 T2^2 )^(1/3) ) ) = (2/9)^(1/3).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me compute it numerically:

(2/9) is approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. Because 0.6^3 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

So a1 is smaller than a2, which makes sense because Planet_1 is closer in (shorter period) and the star is more massive (so for same period, a would be smaller, but here the period is even shorter, so a is much smaller).

Wait, to get a better ratio:

a1 / a2 = ( (2 M2 (T2/3)^2 ) / ( M2 T2^2 ) )^(1/3)
= ( (2 (T2^2 / 9 )) / ( T2^2 )) )^(1/3)
= ( (2/9) )^(1/3)
Which is the cube root of (2/9) as above.

So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2.

So a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Now, the transit probability is proportional to R_*/a, as per my earlier thought. Since R_* is same for both, the transit probability is inversely proportional to a.

So Probability ∝ 1/a.

So P1 / P2 = a2 / a1.

So substituting a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3),

P1/P2 = (a2) / ( a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) )

Which is (9/2)^(1/3).

Hmm, 9/2 is 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is approximately 1.65. Because 1.6^3 is approximately 4.096, and 1.65^3 is about 4.489, which is close to 4.5.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1 is more likely to transit than Planet_2.

Wait, but wait! The transit probability is P = (R_*/a) * ( (R_p + R_*) / a )? Or am I mixing something up? Or is it just R_* / a? I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbit, when viewed edge-on, passes in front of the star. The formula I've seen is:

P = (R_*/a) * ( (R_*/a) + (R_p/a) )

But if R_p is much smaller than R_*, then it's approximately (R_*/a)^2. Or wait, perhaps the exact formula is P = (R_*/a)², but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, another source I've read says that the transit probability is given by (R_*/a), assuming R_p << R_*. Because when the orbit is edge-on, the planet must pass within ±R_* in the sky, so the width is 2R_*, and the length along the orbit is 2a. So the probability is (2 R_*)/(2 a) ) = R_*/a.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle. The probability is proportional to (R_*/a), where a is the semi-major axis. So P = (R_*/a) * (something else?), but perhaps that's the main factor.

So if that's the case, then since R_* is same for both, the probability is inversely proportional to a.

So since Planet_1 has a smaller a, its P is higher.

So let's compute the ratio P1/P2.

P1/P2 = (R_* / a1 ) / ( R_* / a2 ) = a2 / a1.

As before, a2 / a1 = (a2)/(a1) = 1/( (2/9)^(1/3) ) ) = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is about 1.65 times P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher transit probability, so the researchers should choose to observe Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times higher.

Wait, let me check the cube root calculation again.

(9/2) is 4.5. The cube root of 4.5 is about 1.65. So P1 is about 1.65 times P2. So Planet_1's probability is higher.

So the correct option is C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't mix up P1 and P2. So P1 is for Planet_1, which has a shorter period and a smaller a. So a1 is smaller than a2. Since P is inversely proportional to a, P1 is larger.

So the ratio P1/P2 is (a2/a1) = (9/2)^(1/3) ≈ 1.65.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to \( P \propto \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on \( a \), meaning closer-in planets (smaller \( a \)) have higher transit probabilities.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* T^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( T \) is the orbital period, we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes for Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)).
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's (\( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{3} \)).

Substituting these values, the semi-major axis ratio is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left( \frac{M_1 T_1^2}{M_2 T_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{3}\right)^2}{T_2^2} \right)^{1/3} = \left( \frac{2}{9} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{2}{9} \) is approximately \( 0.6 \), so \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \). This means Planet_1's semi-major axis is smaller than Planet_2's, making its transit probability higher.

The transit probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3}} = \left(\frac{9}{2}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

The cube root of \( \frac{9}{2} \) (4.5) is approximately \( 1.65 \). Thus, Planet_1 has about 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

Given the options, the correct choice is:

**C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.**
