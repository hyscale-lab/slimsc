Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, oscillating charge distribution and radiation. Alright, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they can radiate energy, right? So, the setup is a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating, with its symmetry along the z-axis. The question is about the power radiated at a specific angle θ and how it depends on wavelength λ.

The problem states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the possible form of f.

Wait, let me think about the radiation from oscillating charges. I remember something about dipole radiation. Oh, right! For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator, perpendicular to the axis. So for a dipole, the radiation is strongest when θ is 90 degrees. But wait, what's the formula for the power radiated in a particular direction?

I think the power per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin θ)^2. Because the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, where sin θ is 1. So the radiation pattern falls off as we move towards θ=0 or θ=180 degrees.

So if the maximum is A, then the power at any angle θ would be A multiplied by (sin θ)^2 divided by the maximum value. Wait, but the maximum value is when sin θ is 1, so the ratio is (sin θ)^2.

Wait no, wait. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. So f(θ) is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum is when sinθ is 1, so f_max is f at θ=90°, which is A. Then, at θ=30°, sinθ is 0.5, so f(30°) is (0.5)^2 = 0.25 times A. So the fraction would be 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4 of A.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the maximum power A the total power, or the maximum per unit solid angle? Let me read the question again. "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So, wait, the maximum power per unit solid angle is A. Because maximum occurs when sinθ is 1, so the function f would be A at θ=90°, and at θ=30°, it's 1/4 of that, so 1/4 A. So the fraction is 1/4.

So the first part of the answer is 1/4. Now, looking at the options, the options A, B, C, D have the first part as 1/2, 1/4, 1/4, or 3/4. So in this case, our calculation says 1/4. So options B and C are possible for the fraction.

Next, the form of f. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which for dipole radiation depends on (sinθ)^2. But the question also asks about the dependence on λ. Hmm, I remember that the power radiated by an oscillating dipole depends on the square of the amplitude of the acceleration, and inversely on the cube of the wavelength (or something like that). Or wait, maybe it's the square of the amplitude multiplied by the square of the frequency or something. Let me think. 

The average power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by P_avg = ( (μ_0 μ_0) / (12π c^3) ) * ( (d^3 q/dt^3 )^2 ), but I might be mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) for dipole radiation is given by I(θ,φ) = ( (μ_0)^2 (d^2 p/dt^2)^2 ) / ( 12 π c^5 ) ) * ( ( sinθ )^2 ) / ( 4π ), wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, I think the radiation intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2 and also inversely proportional to λ^
