Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... Oh right, that's usually a reaction for the hydrolysis of an ester or maybe for the formation of an acid from an acyl chloride. Wait, no, when an ester reacts with HI, maybe it's acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. But wait, red phosphorus is often used in the hydrolysis of esters, converting them into acids. Oh wait, no, maybe it's related to the formation of an acid from an acyl chloride. Alternatively, another thought: when alkenes react with red phosphorus, it's for the deoxygenation of epoxides or maybe something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start by analyzing the data.

First, let me look at the IR data. The IR shows strong absorption between 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually corresponds to O-H stretches, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. A carbonyl could be from an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have broader O-H stretches, so if the IR has a peak around 1720, maybe it's an ester. But wait, the 3400-2500 region could also be from an alcohol or maybe an amine. Wait, but in the NMR, I should look for signs of O-H protons.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: There's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That sounds like a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Because alcohols typically have protons around 1-5 ppm, but a carboxylic acid proton is usually around 10-12 ppm. So this suggests the compound has a carboxylic acid group. Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which would align with a carboxylic acid (their carbonyls are around 1700 cm-1). So that fits.

Wait, but another possibility: an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but it's usually a triplet or something if next to a CH2. But here it's a broad singlet, so more likely a carboxylic acid.

Then the NMR has peaks at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a substituted benzene ring. The doublets for 2H each suggest a para-substituted benzene. Like para-substituted, for example, a benzene where two substituents are opposite each other.

Wait, the integration for those aromatic protons is 2H each. So,
