Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question is about a star that's being observed by astronomers. The star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K. Because of these spots, the brightness changes as the star rotates, which they observe. But the problem says this situation can look like an exoplanet causing the brightness variations. They want to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness change as these spots.

Hmm, so when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The drop in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star, right? So the formula I remember is that the relative flux change (ΔF/F) is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, in this case, the spots are causing a variation when the star rotates. So the brightness change isn't just a simple dip; it's more of a modulation over time. But the question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So we're comparing the maximum dip caused by the planet to the maximum dip caused by the spots.

Let me think about the spots first. The star has a radius R = R_sun. One hemisphere is spotted, with 20% coverage. So the area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere. Wait, but wait, because when the star rotates, we only see one hemisphere at a time. So the total area of the star's surface is 4πR², and one hemisphere is the area we see, which is 2πR².

The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so area = 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². But wait, that's the total spot area. But each spot is cooler. The star's Teff is 6000 K, spots are 5000 K. So when the spots are facing us, they contribute less flux than the rest of the star.

The brightness variation would be due to the spots rotating into and out of view. The maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible from our perspective. But wait, wait, no, because when the star rotates, the spots come into the visible hemisphere. But wait, in the problem setup, one hemisphere is entirely covered in spots. So when the star isn't rotating, we see that hemisphere. Wait, no, the star is rotating, so when it's rotating, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere. If one hemisphere is spotted, when it's facing us, we see all the spots. When it rotates 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (which is spot-free) is facing us. So the brightness variation would be the difference between the spotted and unspotted halves.

Hmm, okay. So the star's brightness without spots is F = σTeff^4 * 4πR^2 / (4πD²) ) [where D is distance to us], but since all stars are at the same distance, the flux is proportional to the surface area times the temperature^4. Wait, no, flux is σT^4 * (π R² / D²) for a star, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the total luminosity is 4πR²σTeff^4. But when part of the star is cooler, the observed flux will decrease by the area of the cooler regions times the difference in their flux.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the star's brightness as a sum of the normal areas and the spotted areas.

So, the total flux from the star when the spots are facing us is F_total = F_0 - F_spot, where F_0 is the normal flux, and F_spot is the flux lost due to the spots.

Wait, but for a star with spots, the total flux would be the sum of the unspotted area and the spotted area, each contributing their respective fluxes.

So the unspotted area is A_unspotted = area of the hemisphere (2πR²) minus the area of the spots (0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR²) → A_unspotted = 2πR² - 0.4πR² = 1.6 π R².

The spotted area is 0.4π R².

The flux from unspotted regions is F_unspotted = (1.6 π R²) * σ T^4. But wait, T is 6000 K for the unspotted regions, and T_spot is 5000 K.

Wait no, actually, the flux from the unspotted part is F_unspotted = 1.6 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

The flux from the spotted part is F_spotted = 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

So the total flux when the spots are visible is F_total = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

The normal star's flux when unspotted (if all of the hemisphere was at 6000 K) would be F_normal = 2 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the difference in flux is ΔF = F_normal - F_total.

So substituting the values:

ΔF = [2 π R² σ (6000)^4] - [1.6 π R² σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 π R² σ (5000)^4 ]

Simplify this:

ΔF = (2 π R² σ) [6000^4 * (2 - 1.6) ] - (0.4 π R² σ 5000^4 )

Wait, let me compute each part:

F_unspotted is (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted is (0.4 π R^2) * σ (5000)^4.

So F_total = 1.6 π R^2 σ 6000^4 + 0.4 π R^2 σ 5000^4.

F_normal is 2 π R^2 σ 6000^4.

So ΔF = F_normal - F_total = (2 - 1.6) π R² σ 6000^4 - (0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 - 6000^4))?

Wait, maybe not. Let me compute it:

ΔF = [2 π R² σ (6000^4)] - [ (1.6 π R² σ 6000^4) + (0.4 π R² σ 5000^4) ) ]

Factor out π R² σ:

ΔF = π R² σ [ 2 *6000^4 - (1.6 *6000^4 + 0.4 *5000^4) ]

= π R² σ [ (2 - 1.6 ) *6000^4 - 0.4 *5000^4 ]

= π R² σ [ 0.4 *6000^4 - 0.4 *5000^4 ]

= 0.4 π R² σ [6000^4 -5000^4 ]

So the relative change in flux is (ΔF / F_normal).

Because F_normal is 2 π R² σ 6000^4, so:

(ΔF / F_normal) = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ 6000^4]

Simplify:

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2 *6000^4 ]

= (0.4 / 2 ) * [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Compute (5000/6000)^4:

5000 is 5/6 of 6000.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

So 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.103549.

So the relative flux change is about 10.35% when the spots are visible.

Wait, wait, but when the star is not spotted, the maximum dip would be when the planet transits. So the planet would block some of the star's light, leading to a dip of (R_planet/R_star)^2.

Wait, but in the case of the spots, the maximum dip is 10.35%, I think. Because when the spots are in view, the flux is lower than when they're not. Wait, no, actually, the normal flux is when the spots aren't visible? Wait no, the star is always emitting. Oh wait, no, the spots are on the star, so their effect is always present when the star is in a certain orientation. But when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. So the maximum dip would be when the spots are fully visible. Wait, but perhaps the dip is the difference between when the spots are facing us (lower flux) and when they're not (normal flux).

Wait, perhaps I got this wrong. Let me think again.

When the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and the other hemisphere (without spots) comes into view as it rotates. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, we see the lower flux. When the other hemisphere is facing us, we see the normal flux.

Wait, but no: the star's total flux is the sum of both hemispheres, but if one hemisphere is hotter and the other is cooler, that's a different scenario. Wait, but in this problem, the star's Teff is 6000 K, and one hemisphere has spots that are 5000 K. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is lower than when the other hemisphere is facing us.

Wait, but the star is a sphere. So the surface area we see when a hemisphere is viewed is 2πR^2.

Wait, but the star's effective temperature is an average, considering all the surface. So if part of the surface is cooler, the overall flux would be less than the full 6000 K flux.

Wait, perhaps the maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us. Because when the spots are on the near side, that part is cooler, but when the spots are on the far side, that part is cooler but we don't see it. Wait no, because the star is a sphere, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in the observed flux.

Wait, perhaps the maximum flux occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is facing us. So the variation is between these two extremes.

Wait, but the star emits from all its surface. So the total flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be less than when the unspotted hemisphere is visible.

So the variation in brightness as the star rotates would be the difference between when the unspotted hemisphere is visible (max flux) and when the spotted hemisphere is visible (min flux).

But wait, the star is a sphere. Each hemisphere is 2πR², right? So when the star rotates, we see either the spotted or the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait no, that's not right. When you look at a sphere, the visible area is a hemisphere (2πR²) regardless of rotation. So when the star is rotating, only one hemisphere is facing us at a time. If that hemisphere is the spotted one, we see spots; if it's the unspotted, we don't. But wait, the problem said that one hemisphere is covered in spots. So the other hemisphere is spot-free.

So when the star's rotation brings the spotted hemisphere into view, we see the spots, leading to lower flux. When the other hemisphere comes into view, no spots, so higher flux.

So the maximum and minimum fluxes are when the star shows either the spotted or the unspotted hemisphere.

So the flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible: F_spotted_hemisphere = (unspotted area on hemisphere * 6000^4) + (spotted area on hemisphere * 5000^4).

The unspotted area on the hemisphere is 20% of the hemisphere: wait no, the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R². So the unspotted area is 2πR² - 0.4π R² = 1.6 π R².

So F_spotted_hemisphere = (1.6 π R²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R^2) * σ (5000)^4.

The flux when the unspotted hemisphere is visible: F_unspotted_hemisphere = 2π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the difference in flux between the two is:

ΔF = F_unspotted_hemisphere - F_spotted_hemisphere.

= [2 π R^2 σ 6000^4 ] - [1.6 π R^2 σ 6000^4 + 0.4 π R^2 σ 5000^4 ]

= (2 - 1.6) π R^2 σ 6000^4 - 0.4 π R^2 σ 5000^4.

= 0.4 π R^2 σ 6000^4 - 0.4 π R^2 σ 5000^4.

Factor out 0.4 π R^2 σ:

= 0.4 π R^2 σ (6000^4 -5000^4).

The relative change is ΔF / F_unspotted_hemisphere.

Because F_unspotted_hemisphere is the flux when the star is at maximum brightness.

So ΔF / F_unspotted = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4)] / [2 π R² σ 6000^4 ]

Simplify:

= [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [2 *6000^4 ]

= (0.4 / 2) * [ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As I calculated before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So 1 - 0.48225 = 0.51775.

0.2 * 0.51775 ≈ 0.10355 → about 10.355% change.

So the amplitude of the brightness variation is about 10.355%.

Now, the question is, what radius of a planet would cause the same amplitude in the star's light curve? So when the planet transits, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

Because the planet blocks part of the star's light. The maximum dip is when the planet is in front of the star, blocking some of the light. So the relative change in flux is (R_planet^2)/(R_star^2).

We need this dip to be equal to the 10.355% change we just found.

So,

(R_planet / R_star)^2 = 0.10355 → R_planet / R_star = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no! Because the planet's transit would block a part of the star's disk, leading to a dip of (R_planet / R_star)^2. So if the planet's radius is R_p and the star's radius is R_s, the dip is (R_p/R_s)^2.

Wait, but in our case, the dip from the spots is about 10.355%. So setting (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_s = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218. So about 0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the calculation for the relative dip when the planet transits is (R_p/R_s)^2. So if the dip is 10.355%, then R_p/R_s is sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options: option D is ~0.32. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me check the initial calculation again. Because sometimes when dealing with flux from spots, I might have made a mistake in the proportions.

Wait, another approach: the total flux when the spots are visible is F_spotted. The normal flux is F_normal (when unspotted hemisphere is visible). So the maximum dip is F_normal - F_spotted.

Wait, no, when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us, the flux is higher. So the maximum brightness is F_unspotted_hemisphere, and the minimum is F_spotted_hemisphere. So the variation is (F_unspotted_hemisphere - F_spotted_hemisphere) / F_unspotted_hemisphere.

Which is what I calculated as about 10.355%.

So the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R_s)^2 = 0.10355 → R_p/R_s ≈ 0.3218.

So the correct option is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star's spotted hemisphere, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius: \( R_{\star} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).  
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.  
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   The star's brightness varies as its spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of view. The maximum brightness occurs when the unspotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum occurs when the spotted hemisphere is visible.  
   - The unspotted area of the hemisphere is \( 1.6 \pi R_{\star}^2 \) (80% of the hemisphere).  
   - The spotted area of the hemisphere is \( 0.4 \pi R_{\star}^2 \) (20% of the hemisphere).  
   - The flux from the unspotted hemisphere is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{unspotted}} = 2 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]  
   - The flux from the spotted hemisphere is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = (1.6 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma (6000)^4) + (0.4 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma (5000)^4)
     \]  
   - The difference in flux between the two hemispheres is:  
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{unspotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}
     \]  
   - Substituting values:  
     \[
     \Delta F = 2 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 - \left[ 1.6 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma (6000)^4 + 0.4 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma (5000)^4 \right]
     \]  
     \[
     \Delta F = 0.4 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma \left( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \right)
     \]  
   - The relative flux change is:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = \frac{0.4 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma \left( 6000^4 - 5000^4 \right)}{2 \pi R_{\star}^2 \sigma (6000)^4}
     \]  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]  
   - Compute \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \):  
     \[
     \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 = \frac{625}{1296} \approx 0.48225
     \]  
   - Thus:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.2 \left( 1 - 0.48225 \right) = 0.2 \times 0.51775 \approx 0.10355 \, \text{(or 10.355%)}.
     \]

3. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:  
   The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
   \[
   \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} \right)^2 = \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{unspotted}}} = 0.10355 \):  
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\star}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
   \]  
   Therefore, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \).

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is **0.32**.
