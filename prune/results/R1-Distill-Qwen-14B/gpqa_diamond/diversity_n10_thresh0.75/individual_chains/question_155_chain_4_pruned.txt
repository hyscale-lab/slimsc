Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. In this case, A is P_z.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So, this is a three-component vector, which makes sense because the matrices for Px, Py, Pz are 3x3 each.

Wait, right. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the state we're given is expressed in the P_z basis. So, the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, which might make things a bit easier.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. Oh, right, because the state is given as a column vector in the P_z basis. So, to find the expectation values for P_z and P_z squared, I need to work with this state.

First, let's write down the state |ψ>. It's a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/2 ]
          [ 1/√2 ]
          [ -1/2 ]

Wait, but I should probably verify if this is a normalized state. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

(|-1/2|)^2 = 1/4
(1/√2)^2 = 1/2
(|-1/2|)^2 = 1/4

Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

But wait, since the state is |ψ>, and the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, then P_z acts on
