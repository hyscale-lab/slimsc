Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction involving 3-methylpyrrolidine and another compound A. The product formed is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out which reagent A and catalyst B are used.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structures of the compounds involved. 3-methylpyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. The methyl group is on the third carbon. So the structure is a pyrrolidine ring, with a CH2CH(CH3) group attached to the nitrogen? Wait, no, wait. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one NH. So 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group on the third carbon of the ring.

Then, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me break that down. The substituent on the pyrrolidine is at position 1. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Cyclohexylidene would be a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached via a methylene group (CH2)?

Wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be like CH2-Cyclohexene. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So the structure is pyrrolidine with a CH2-Cyclohexene group attached to the nitrogen, and a methyl group on the third carbon.

So the reaction is between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A, using a catalyst B, and maybe some heat and a solvent. The product is this substituted pyrrolidine. The question is about what A and B are.

Looking at the options, the possible A's are cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. The catalysts are TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid) or acetic acid.

I remember that acid-catalyzed reactions involving amines and carbonyl compounds often lead to imine or enamine formation. Wait, but 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine.
