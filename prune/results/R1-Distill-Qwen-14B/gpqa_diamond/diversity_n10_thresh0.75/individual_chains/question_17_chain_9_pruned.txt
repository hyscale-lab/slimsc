Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free metal ions can be found using the dissociation constant. In this case, the Ca-EDTA complex is probably dissociating into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions.

Wait, so the formation of the complex is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, right? That K is the formation constant, Kf. So Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. So initially, when the complex is formed, the concentration is 0.02 M, and the solution is at stoichiometric conditions. Now, we need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the complex is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, it will break
