Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me read it again. Oh right, the process is p + pbar → 2A+ + 2A-. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV/c². I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D with various fractions of the speed of light.

Wait, what do I remember about annihilation processes? Well, when particles and their antiparticles annihilate, they convert into other particle-antiparticle pairs. But wait, in this case, an antiproton is annihilating with a proton, but producing four particles: two A+ and two A-. So that's two pairs of particles and antiparticles. So each A+ is the particle, and A- is the antiparticle.

Wait, but the initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (pbar). Their rest masses are the same, right? So the initial total energy is the sum of their rest energies plus any kinetic energy. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy? Or maybe not, but I'm not sure.

Wait, when the antiproton is moving slowly, that implies that its velocity is much less than c, so maybe it's non-relativistic. So perhaps I can approximate the energy using non-relativistic terms. Or maybe I should consider relativistic terms since even a slow-moving particle with high mass might have significant energy.

But let's think about conservation of energy and momentum here. Because in annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved.

The initial system has a proton and an antiproton. Let me denote their masses as m_p. The proton is at rest? Or are both moving? Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Wait, but the problem statement says p + pbar → 2A+ + 2A-. So initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (pbar). The proton is presumably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton.

After the annihilation, we have four particles: two A+ and two A-. But wait, since A+ and A- are produced in pairs, maybe they are all moving together or in some symmetric way. But
