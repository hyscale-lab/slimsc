Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's think it through.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The first step is treating it with bromine. Wait, bromine usually adds across carbonyl groups. Oh right, when ketones react with bromine (Br2), they undergo a nucleophilic addition. So the carbonyl oxygen becomes an alcohol and the adjacent carbon gets a bromide. So product 1 would be bromocyclohexanol, or maybe 1-bromocyclohexanol. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right. The carbonyl group in cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. Adding Br2 in a nucleophilic addition would form a dihydroxy dibromide? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another possibility: bromine can add to the carbonyl via a conjugate addition, but I think for ketones, the addition is more straightforward. Oh right, the correct reaction is the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group, which would form a 1,2-dibromocyclohexane derivative? Wait, no, maybe it's more like cyclohexane with a bromine and an -OH group. Wait, no, no, wait. Let me think again. When a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (Br2), it's a conjugate addition, maybe? Or is it a typical addition where the bromine adds to the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with other reactions. Let me recall. Cyclohexanone reacting with Br2 in a non-polar solvent, like CCl4, would lead to the formation of a bromohydrin. Oh, that's right! So the ketone (cyclohexanone) reacts with bromine to form a bromohydrin. So product 1 is 1-bromo-1-cyclohexanol. Because in the addition, the bromide adds to the carbonyl carbon and the hydroxyl group adds to the adjacent carbon. Wait, no
