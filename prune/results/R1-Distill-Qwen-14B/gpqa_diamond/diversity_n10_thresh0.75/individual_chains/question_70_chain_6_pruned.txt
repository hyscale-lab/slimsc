Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break down the information given.

Okay, the first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, that's a lot of B reacting with A. I wonder what elements could be involved here. Maybe something with transition metals because they often form colored compounds. Wait, bright red makes me think of something like copper(II) compounds, but I'm not sure yet.

Next, when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, if E is dangerous, maybe it's something like a toxic gas or a strong acid. But I'll have to think more about this.

Then, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Strong acid examples are like HCl, H2SO4, etc., while weak ones are like CH3COOH or HNO2. So, when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and these two acids. That suggests that C might be a salt that can hydrolyze. If F is strong, maybe it's a nitrate or sulfate, and G is something else.

Looking at the next point: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, acetone, etc. But since D and B react in 1:1, maybe they form something like HCl from H2 and Cl2? No, that would require 1:1, but HCl is a gas. Alternatively, maybe they form something like NH3 and H2O? Wait, but D and B are gases. Wait, B is a gas, so if D is another gas, their reaction forms a solvent, perhaps H2O? But H2O is a solvent, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, think about common gas reactions. Maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2 or Cl2. Suppose B is Cl2. Then D might be something else. Or maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but H2 is a gas. If they react in 1:1, perhaps forming H2O? But that would require O2 and H2 in a 2:1 ratio, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is H2 and D is Cl2, then maybe their reaction could form HCl? But that would be a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but HCl is a gas. So I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe H2 and Cl2 react to form HCl, but that's a 1:1 ratio. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. So maybe H is something else.

Wait, maybe the reaction is between H2 and O2. But that requires a catalyst and they react in a 2:1 ratio for H2O. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me go back to the first reaction. Solid A + 8 B → C (bright red). 8 equivalents is a lot, which suggests that B is a diatomic molecule and A is a metal. Because, for example, if B is Cl2, and A is Cu, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Cu. Let's see: Cu reacts with Cl2 in a 1:4 ratio to form CuCl2. Wait, but that's 1 mole Cu to 2 moles Cl2? No, wait, the reaction is 2 Cu + 3 Cl2 → 2 CuCl3? No, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, Cu reacts with Cl2 in combustion to form CuCl2. The balanced equation is 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl. Wait, no, 2 Cu + Cl2 → 2 CuCl. But wait, 2 moles of Cl2 would be needed for 4 moles of Cu? Or wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe A is iron. If B is Cl2, then Fe reacts with Cl2 to form FeCl3. But in that case, the stoichiometry is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So that's 3 equivalents of Cl2 per mole of Fe. But in the problem, it's 8 equivalents. So the ratio is 8:1 for B to A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal with a higher valency. Let me think of another element.

Wait, another approach: the bright red product C. What compounds are bright red? Copper(II) oxide is black. Lead dioxide is brown. Iron(III) oxide is reddish. Wait, maybe it's a sulfide? No, sulfides are often black or yellow. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrate? Wait, nitrates are usually colorless. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a complex ion? Or a different compound
