Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons because of conservation laws—like conservation of energy and momentum. But wait, let me think about this step by step.

So, the problem says an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass change for the moving object. Gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for the electron, gamma is 4; positron is 2.

Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their velocities are in opposite directions. Let me consider the electron's velocity to the right as positive and the positron's as negative, but since they're coming from opposite ends, the positron's velocity is to the left, so it's negative in the same frame as the electron's positive direction.

Wait, no. Wait, the electron is moving from the left, so to the right. The positron is moving from the right, so to the left. So in the same frame, their velocities are opposite. So their velocities are towards each other.

Now, since they annihilate, we have to consider conservation of momentum and energy. But wait, because they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta might have opposite signs.

Wait, but the electron and positron have the same rest mass, right? The positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so same mass. So both have rest mass m_e.

Now, in terms of their momentum, the electron has momentum gamma * m_e * v_e, and the positron has gamma' * m_e * v_p. But since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total momentum before collision is the sum of their momenta vectors.

Wait, but wait. If the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative. So the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * (-v_p). But I think I need to get the actual values of their velocities
