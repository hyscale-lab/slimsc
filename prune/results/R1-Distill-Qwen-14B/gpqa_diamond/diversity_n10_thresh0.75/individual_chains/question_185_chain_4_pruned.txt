Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, the question is asking about the eigenvalues of H, which is given as ε times the dot product of σ and n vectors. Right, σ is the Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction. Oh wait, and ε is an energy constant.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each of which are 2x2 matrices. So the dot product σ.n would be a combination of these matrices. But wait, when we take the dot product of σ with n, it's like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So the Hamiltonian H is ε multiplied by that sum.

Wait, but when you have an operator like that, its eigenvalues depend on the properties of the Pauli matrices. I think each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. Oh right, because each σ_i squared is the identity matrix. So, the square of the sum (n · σ) would be (n · σ)^2 = n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + cross terms. But since σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), each term becomes n_i² I. So all together, that's (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I. But since n is a
