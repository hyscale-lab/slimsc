Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown white solid based on the spectral data provided. Hmm, let's go through the information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and it's 100%, which usually means the molecular formula might correspond to that mass. But there's also a peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Wait, that's 2 more than the molecular ion. That could indicate the presence of a chlorine atom because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35.5. So, if the molecular ion is 156, and Cl is present, maybe the molecule is Cl-containing. So, when Cl is present, the molecular ion can split into isotopic peaks, like Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the M and M+2 peaks would be at 156 and 158 respectively. That makes sense because the Cl isotopes are naturally occurring (about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37). So the relative abundance would be 3:1 ratio for M:M+2. Wait, in the data here, M is 100% and M+2 is 32%. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Chlorine has an approximate abundance of 75% for Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So when a molecule has one Cl atom, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at M (Cl-35) and another at M+2 (Cl-37). The ratio should be approximately 3:1 because (3/4 Cl-35 and 1/4 Cl-37). So the M peak would be 75% and M+2 would be 25%. But in the problem, M is 100 and M+2 is 32. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, maybe the molecular formula has two Cl atoms? Because if there are two Cl atoms, each with their own isotopes, the combination could lead to a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the 156 is the molecular ion without Cl, but the 158 is the M+2. Wait, no, the M is 156, which includes everything. Wait, maybe it's not Cl. Another possibility is that the molecule has a double bond (like an alkene) which could cause a peak at M+2 due to the coupling between ^1H and ^2H. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur isotope? No, that's less likely. Hmm, perhaps I'll come back to this after looking at other data.

Next, the IR spectrum: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually suggest the presence of either an -OH group (like in an acid or alcohol) or an -NH group (like in amines, but less likely here since the NMR doesn't show any amine protons). The other strong sharp peak is at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1720 region is typical for esters, ketones, or maybe an acid. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches which are usually very broad, but in IR, the carbonyl in carboxylic acids is around 1700 cm^-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is around 1740-1720 cm^-1, so 1720 would fit ester. Or maybe a ketone? But ketones are usually around 1700-1750 as well. But considering the broad peak, maybe it's a carboxylic acid since the O-H of the acid would explain the broad peak from 3500-2700. Wait, but the broad peak could also be from an alcohol. Hmm. Let me think.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 11.0 ppm (s, 1H): A singlet at 11 ppm is very characteristic. That's a strong deshielded proton, which is often a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Because carboxylic acids have protons that are usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet, so maybe it's deprotonated? Wait, but in DMSO or another solvent, the proton might appear as a singlet, but I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10 ppm. Wait, no, aldehydes are around 9-10, so 11 is more like a carboxylic acid. Oh wait, maybe it's an aldehyde with some substituent causing it to shift up, but that's less common. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton in a very deshielded environment, but 11 ppm is way up there, more like an -OH or -COOH.

Then, the other signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H). These look like two doublets each integrating to 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. So maybe the compound has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. For example, if it's a para-substituted aromatic acid or something like that. So, in para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho and meta would couple with each other, leading to two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzoic acid, the two protons on either side of the substituent would each be a doublet, integrating to 2H each.

Putting it together: Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be a benzaldehyde with Cl on position 3 and OH on position 2. The NMR would have a CHO proton, which is around 9-10 ppm. But in this case, the NMR shows 11 ppm, which is higher. Also, the IR would show a strong carbonyl (benzaldehyde) but also an O-H (phenolic OH), which would show a broad peak. But in the IR, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which could include the O-H. The molecular formula for this would have a benzaldehyde (C7H5ClO2) molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5, so m/z 156.5 would be the molecular ion. That matches with the M at 156. But the M+2 would be 158, which would make sense if there's a Cl. So the molecular ion at 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37). The problem says M is 100%, M+2 is 32%, but wait, if the molecular formula has one Cl, the ratio should be 3:1 (75% Cl-35, 25% Cl-37). So M would be 75%, M+2 25%. But in the question, M is 100% and M+2 is 32%. Hmm, that might not fit. Also, the NMR in option A would have a CHO proton, which is around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But the NMR here has a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is higher. So maybe it's not option A.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzoic acid with Cl in the para position. So the structure would be Cl attached to the benzene ring opposite the COOH group. The IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) around 3000-2500 cm^-1, but the broad peak here is from 3500-2700. Also, the carbonyl (COOH) would be around 1700 cm^-1. The given IR has 1720, which is a bit higher, so perhaps more like an ester. But benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a deprotonated acid, but in the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet. Wait, benzoic acid would have a COOH proton around 12 ppm, but as a broad peak, not a singlet. Wait, but in D2O or if it's exchanged, maybe it's a singlet. Hmm. Let's think about the NMR of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The carboxylic proton would be a broad peak, but in the data, it's a singlet at 11.0. Maybe because in the NMR, the sample is dissolved in a solvent that exchanges the O-H, so it's a sharp singlet? Not sure, but I'm not certain. Let's check the molecular formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight: 12*7=84, 5*1=5, 35.5 (Cl), 16*2=32. So 84+5+35.5+32 = 156.5, so molecular ion at 156. M+2 would be 158, with 25% abundance. But in the problem, M is 100%, M+2 is 32%. So that doesn't fit. So maybe option B is not correct.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OCl-CO-O-Ph. So it's an ester, OCOCl attached to benzene. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So in this case, R is phenyl. So the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would show a strong carbonyl (ester), which is around 1720 cm^-1, which fits. The broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 would suggest an O-H stretch, but in chloroformate, there's no O-H. Wait, unless it's some kind of acidic proton elsewhere. Or maybe it's the Cl's stretching? No, Cl stretches are usually lower. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from a different group, but in chloroformate, I don't think there's an O-H. So why would there be a broad peak in IR? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps it's from the COCl group? No, the COCl would have strong absorption around 1800 cm^-1. Wait, wait, the IR shows a strong sharp peak at 1720, which would fit the carbonyl in an ester. But the broad peak is 3500-2700, which is usually O-H. Since phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an O-H, this might not fit. Hmm. Let me think about the NMR. The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which might correspond to something else, but chloroformate would have Cl as a substituent. The aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted pattern if the substituent is in para. Wait, the substituent is the OCOCl group. So, the aromatic protons would be ortho and para to that group. So the substitution would be at a certain position. Let me think about the splitting. If the substituent is para (like on the benzene ring in position 4), then the adjacent protons (ortho) would be at a certain shift. The NMR shows two doublets, 8.02 and 7.72. Maybe the protons ortho and para to the substituent. But wait, in a mono-substituted benzene, the ortho and para protons would couple with each other, leading to a doublet of doublets, but perhaps in some cases, they split into two doublets. Alternatively, if the substituent is electron-withdrawing, like Cl, it would deshield the ortho and para protons.

Wait, but in the case of phenyl chloroformate, the structure is OCl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So the structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituent is OCOCl attached to the benzene ring. Now, the substituent is an ester group, which is an electron-withdrawing group. So the ring would have substituents in a certain pattern. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, perhaps. Let me think about the NMR shifts. The protons ortho to the substituent would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The para protons would be less deshielded. So for a substituent like OCOCl, which is deactivating and meta-directing, the ring protons would be split into specific patterns. But I'm not sure about the exact shifts. The NMR has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would fit a para-substituted benzene, where each set of two protons are equivalent. For example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the protons ortho and para to the substituent are each a doublet. So maybe in phenyl chloroformate, the substituent is at the para position, leading to two doublets.

But the issue is the IR. If there's no O-H in the molecule, why is there a broad peak between 3500-2700? Maybe it's an exchange peak or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the IR is showing an absorption for the C-O stretch in the ester. But esters usually have C-O stretches around 1250-1000 cm^-1, which isn't in the broad region. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has some other functional group with an O-H. But I don't think phenyl chloroformate has that. So maybe option C is not the correct one.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to the benzene ring at the ortho position relative to the COOH group. So in this case, the benzoic acid has Cl in the 2-position. The IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and a carbonyl around 1700 cm^-1. The given IR is 1720, which is a bit higher, so maybe not a carboxylic acid. The NMR would have the COOH proton as a broad peak around 12 ppm, but in the data, it's a singlet at 11.0. The aromatic protons would be more complex. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are in the 2 and 1 positions (COOH in 1, Cl in 2). So the aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. But I'm not exactly sure about the splitting. Wait, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons would not be in a para arrangement, so maybe the splitting would be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR would show more than two sets of signals. For example, if the substituent is at 2, then the adjacent positions (3 and 6) would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH, and the para position (4) would be another set. Hmm, not sure. But looking at the options, let's check the molecular weight. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl at position 2, so molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight is 12*7=84 +5 +35.5 +32= 156.5. So molecular ion at 156, and M+2 at 158 with 32%? Wait, what's the Cl abundance here. For Cl, the M (Cl-35) would be about 75%, and M+2 (Cl-37) about 25%. So the ratio should be 3:1. But the problem states M is 100% and M+2 is 32%. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps D isn't correct either.

Wait, going back to the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156 and 32% at 158. The relative abundance is M:100%, M+2:32%. If the molecule has two Cl atoms, then the isotopic pattern would be more complex. Let's think about that. If the molecule has two Cl atoms, the possible combinations would be both Cl-35 (M=156), one Cl-35 and one Cl-37 (M+2=158), and both Cl-37 (M+4=160). The relative abundance would be based on the natural abundance of Cl. The probability of both Cl being 35 is (0.75)^2 = 0.5625 or 56.25%. Both Cl-37 is (0.25)^2 = 6.25%. M+2 would be 2*(0.75)*(0.25) = 0.375 or 37.5%. So the ratio would be M:56.25%, M+2:37.5%, and M+4:6.25%. But in the problem, M is 100%, M+2 is 32%. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the molecule doesn't have Cl? But the M+2 suggests some isotope. Alternatively, perhaps there's another element with isotopes contributing. For example, sulfur has multiple isotopes, but I don't know the exact abundance. Or maybe it's a molecule with one Cl and another element with isotopes. Alternatively, perhaps it's not about Cl. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe the molecular ion is 156, which could be C9H10O2 (like phenyl acetate or something else). Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with some substituents. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the IR and NMR.

The IR shows a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1. That's more consistent with an ester than a carboxylic acid. Because esters have higher carbonyl frequencies. So maybe the compound is an ester. Looking at the options, option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. But earlier, the IR's broad peak was a problem because phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an O-H.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the IR's broad peak is from an alcohol O-H. But in that case, the compound would be an alcohol. But looking at the options, none of the options are alcohols. So perhaps it's something else.

Wait, looking back at the NMR data: the 11.0 ppm is a singlet. If it's a COOH proton, which is usually a broad peak, but perhaps in this case, it's a singlet because it's exchanged or in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. But 11 ppm is higher than typical aldehydes.

Wait, another thought: could it be a carboxylic acid with a de-shielded proton, perhaps in a ring structure? For example, in a chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH proton is deshielded and appears at higher ppm. Let's say, for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH proton is around 12 ppm. So 11 ppm is a bit lower, but possible.

Let me think about the NMR for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The COOH proton is usually a broad peak around 12 ppm. But in the data, it's a singlet at 11.0. So perhaps the sample is deuterated, or the O-H is exchanged and appears as a singlet. It's possible, though I'm not certain.

But the issue is the mass spec: M is 100% at 156, and M+2 is 32%. If the molecule has one Cl, then the ratio should be about 75%:25%. But the problem states 100% and 32%, which doesn't fit. Unless the molecular ion is Cl-35 at 100%, which is not possible because Cl-37 is present. So maybe the molecule doesn't have Cl? But then, why is the M+2 at 32%? Maybe the molecule has another element with significant isotopic abundance. For example, maybe a sulfur atom. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the M is 156, and M+2 is 158, but the molecular formula doesn't include Cl. Let me see what the formula would be. Let's calculate the molecular formula for M=156.

Assuming it's CxHyOzNwCl..., but given the options, it's more likely that it's organic without nitrogen. Let's compute:

Possible formula: C9H8O2 (which would have molecular weight 9*12 +8*1 +2*16 = 108 +8 +32= 148). That's too low. Alternatively, C8H8O2: (8*12)=96 +8=104 +32=128. No, that's 128. Hmm. Alternatively, C7H5ClO2: 7*12=84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So that's the formula for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Which matches the M of 156. But the problem is the mass spec.

Wait, if the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, the molecular ion should have two peaks: M (Cl-35) at 156 and M+2 (Cl-37) at 158. The relative abundance would be M at 75% and M+2 at 25%. But the question says M is 100%, M+2 is 32%. That doesn't add up. So perhaps the molecular formula doesn't include Cl. But without Cl, how to explain the M+2?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the molecule has a double bond. The presence of a double bond can lead to M+2 due to the ^2H (deuterium? No, because D is not present here). Or more likely, the coupling between ^1H and ^2H in alkenes, which can cause a small M+2 peak. But the abundance would be much smaller. Let me think about that. For alkenes, the M+2 peak is usually less than 1% because of the low natural abundance of ^2H. So the 32% is too high for that. So that's probably not the case.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule contains a bromine atom instead of chlorine? Bromine has an atomic mass of about 80. But then, the molecular ion would be much higher. Let me see: if the molecular ion is 156, and one Br (80), that would require the rest of the molecule to be 76, which is unlikely for an organic compound. So probably not Br.

Wait, maybe it's not a halogen. Another element with significant isotopes is sulfur. Sulfur has several isotopes, with the most abundant being ^32S (95%), ^34S (4.25%), and ^36S (0.8%). So the M and M+4 peaks would be more prominent. The M+4 would be about 5% (from 4.25% of ^34S and 0.8% of ^36S?), but not the M+2. So that doesn't fit the 32% at M+2.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Let's go back to the NMR and IR.

The NMR has two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So the substituent is in the para position, which would cause the adjacent protons to be equivalent and split into two doublets. So the substituent in the benzene is in the para position, which could be a COOH group, a Cl, or another substituent.

The 11.0 ppm singlet is a strong clue. Let's think about what gives a singlet in the NMR. A proton that's not split by any neighboring protons. So if it's a COOH proton, perhaps in a symmetric environment or if it's not near any other protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group without adjacent protons.

Wait, another possibility: the 11.0 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But 11 is a bit high. Could it be an aromatic aldehyde with strong electron-withdrawing groups? Like in salicylaldehyde or something else. But that would make the aldehyde proton more deshielded, perhaps shifting it up. Alternatively, maybe it's not an aldehyde. 

Wait, another thought: could it be a nitro group? No, because nitro groups don't have protons. Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but the 11 ppm is too high for that.

Let me think about the IR again. The carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong peak, so it's probably an ester or a ketone. If it's an ester, then the structure would have an OCOOR group. So looking at the options, option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. So Cl-CO-O-Ph.

So the structure would have the ester group attached to the benzene ring. Let's think about the NMR. The ester group doesn't have protons, so the 11.0 ppm peak must be something else. Wait, but if the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph, then the Cl is attached to the carbonyl. So the benzene ring would have the OCOCl group in the para position. Wait, but if the substituent is in the para position, then the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, which matches the NMR.

But then, why is there a singlet at 11.0? Maybe that's not the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in another position. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That could be from an -NH stretch, but the options don't have amines. Alternatively, perhaps it's from an -OH group, like in an alcohol or phenol. But without an O-H in the structure (like in chloroformate), that wouldn't fit. So maybe the IR is misleading me, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an aldehyde's O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, maybe the IR is incorrect? Or perhaps I'm not considering all possibilities.

Let me think about each option again:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2. Mass 156.5.
- IR: broad O-H (carboxylic acid) and carbonyl around 1700.
- NMR: singlet at 11.0 (COOH), which is a broad peak usually. But in the data, it's sharp, which might not fit. Also, the aromatic protons would be as two doublets if the substituent is para. But benzoic acid in para would have the COOH in position 4, so the aromatic protons would be ortho and para to COOH, which would be positions 3 and 5, and 2 and 6. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituent is in position 4, so the ortho protons are in 3 and 5, and the meta would be in 2 and 6. Hmm, perhaps the NMR would show two doublets for the aromatic protons.

But the issue is the mass spec. The M is 100%, M+2 is 32%. With one Cl, this should be 75% and 25% respectively. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Molecular formula: same as B, C7H5ClO2.
- NMR would have more complex splitting because substituents are not para. So the aromatic protons would not be two doublets. So the NMR doesn't fit.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

- Structure has OH and CHO groups on the benzene ring.
- IR would show O-H (phenol) and CHO's C=O.
- The NMR would have a CHO proton around 9-10 ppm, which is lower than the 11 ppm given.
- The aromatic protons would be more complex than two doublets. So perhaps the NMR doesn't fit.

So, going back, the only option that has an ester group, which fits the 1720 IR, is option C: phenyl chloroformate. But that doesn't explain the broad IR peak. Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak is from something else.

Wait, another thought: the broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 cm^-1 could be from an -NH stretch, but none of the options have amines. Or maybe it's from a C-O stretch. Wait, but C-O in esters is around 1250 cm^-1, not in that region. Alternatively, it could be the O-C-O stretching in the ester group, but that's usually lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an alcohol, but the options don't have alcohols. So maybe option C is the correct one, and perhaps the IR's broad peak is from another source, like a solvent artifact or impurity. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an alkoxy group, but I don't see that in the options.

Another angle: looking at the molecular ion. If the molecular ion is 156, and the M+2 is 32% of that, perhaps the molecular formula includes two atoms of an element with a significant M+2 isotope. For example, if the molecule has two bromine atoms, but that's less likely since Br's isotopic abundance is different. Or maybe it's an element with more than one isotope contributing to M and M+2.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule contains a ^13C isotope. Wait, no, because carbon's isotopic abundance is very low and wouldn't cause a noticeable peak.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let's try to match the options with the data.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate.

- Structure: Cl-CO-O-Ph.
- IR: strong carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1 (fits ester). But no O-H, so why the broad IR peak? Maybe it's from the solvent or the sample wasn't prepared properly. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an impurity. Not a good fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- IR: O-H (broad) and carbonyl (around 1700). The carbonyl here is lower than 1720, but perhaps it's due to conjugation or something else. The NMR has a singlet at 11.0, which might not fit because COOH is usually a broad peak. Also, the mass spec doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR's singlet is from something else. Wait, if the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. But in para substitution, the protons ortho and meta would be equivalent. So the aromatic region would show two doublets, which matches the NMR data.

But the issue remains with the O-H and the mass spec.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

- IR: O-H (phenol) and CHO's C=O. But the NMR's 11 ppm is higher than usual for aldehydes. The aromatic protons would be more complex than two doublets. So not a fit.

Hmm.

Given all this, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, despite the mass spec discrepancy. Because the NMR and IR otherwise fit better.

Wait, but the mass spec for option B would have M at 75% (Cl-35) and M+2 at 25% (Cl-37). But the problem states M is 100%, M+2 is 32%. So that doesn't match. So perhaps the molecular formula isn't including Cl, which is confusing.

Wait, another thought: maybe the molecular ion is Cl-35 (156) with 100%, but that's not possible because Cl-37 exists. So perhaps the molecule doesn't have Cl. Then, why the M+2? Maybe it's a different element.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is 156, and the M+2 is 158 due to another reason. Wait, maybe the molecule has two oxygen atoms, but their isotopes (like O-17 and O-18) would have very low abundance and wouldn't contribute significantly. So that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: the molecular ion peak is 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). What if the molecular formula is C9H10O2? Let me calculate the molecular weight. 9*12=108, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total is 140. So M would be 140. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, C8H8O2: 8*12=96, 8*1=8, 32. Total 136. No.

Hmm, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H5ClO2. That would be 6*12=72, 5=5, 35.5=35.5, 32. Total 144.5. No, not 156.

Wait, another possibility: the molecule has a bromine atom. Let's see: 156 - 80 (Br) =76. 76 could be C5H10O, which is plausible. But that's a stretch, and the options don't include bromine.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two Cl atoms. Let me compute: 156 - 2*35.5=156-71=85. 85 could be C5H5O2. Let's see: 5*12=60, 5=5, 32=32. 60+5+32=97. No, doesn't add up. So that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the spectral data.

Looking again at the NMR: the singlet at 11 ppm. That's likely a carboxylic acid proton. The IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which is higher than typical for a carboxylic acid. That might suggest an ester. But the singlet at 11 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: maybe the structure is a chlorinated benzoate ester. For example, something like Cl-CO-O-R. But in that case, the NMR would have a singlet for the ester's OCOCl, perhaps. But the options don't include that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzoyl chloride. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C: phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (ortho and para to the substituent). That matches the NMR data. The IR's strong carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1 fits the ester. But the broad peak in IR is confusing. Unless the sample was contaminated with water or something else, but that's not a valid reason. Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the IR.

In that case, perhaps option C is the correct answer. But then, the mass spec. If the structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph, the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2. Let me compute the molecular weight: 8*12=96, 7=7, 35.5=35.5, 32=32. Total=96+7=103 +35.5=138.5 +32=170.5. Wait, that's way higher than 156. So that can't be right. So this can't be option C.

Wait, I must have made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. The molecular formula for phenyl chloroformate is O=C(OCl)Ph. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: 7*12=84, 5=5, 35.5=35.5, 32=32. Total=84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So M is 156.5, so the molecular ion would be at 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37). The relative abundance would be 75% and 25%. But the problem states M is 100% and M+2 is 32%. So that doesn't match. So, option C's molecular weight fits, but the isotopic pattern doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement has a typo? Or perhaps I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the M is 158 (Cl-37), but that's unlikely.

Hmm. I'm really torn here. Based on the NMR and IR, option B seems more plausible despite the mass spec not matching. Because the NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene with substituents that create two doublets, which is typical for benzoic acid derivatives.

Wait, another angle: the IR's broad peak could be from the O-H of the carboxylic acid, and the strong peak at 1720 is from the COOH's C=O. But carboxylic acids typically have C=O around 1700 cm^-1, but it can vary. So 1720 is a bit high, but possible.

Putting it all together, I think option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid is the correct structure. The NMR fits, the IR fits (with O-H and C=O), and the molecular formula matches the M. The mass spec discrepancy is confusing, but perhaps it's a mistake or I'm missing something.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. Here's the analysis of the options provided:

### Key Spectral Data:
1. **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**
   - Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156 (100%)**.
   - A peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)**.
   - This suggests the presence of a chlorine atom, as the isotopic pattern (M and M+2) is consistent with Cl-35 and Cl-37. However, the relative abundances (100% at M and 32% at M+2) do not match the expected 75:25 ratio for Cl isotopes, which complicates the interpretation.

2. **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**
   - A **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, likely indicating an O-H group (e.g., carboxylic acid or phenol).
   - A **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group, possibly from a carboxylic acid or ester.

3. **Proton NMR:**
   - **11.0 ppm (s, 1H):** A singlet at this chemical shift suggests a highly deshielded proton, likely from a carboxylic acid (-COOH).
   - **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H):** Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
- Structure: A benzaldehyde derivative with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at position 2 and a chlorine atom at position 3.
- **IR:** The O-H stretch of a phenol would appear in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ range, and the aldehyde C=O would absorb around 1720 cm⁻¹. This fits the IR data.
- **NMR:** The aldehyde proton (-CHO) typically appears as a singlet around 9-10 ppm, but the NMR shows a singlet at **11.0 ppm**, which is too high for an aldehyde. Additionally, the aromatic protons would not produce two simple doublets due to the ortho and meta substitution pattern.
- **Mass:** The molecular formula (C7H5ClO2) matches the molecular ion at **m/z = 156**, but the NMR and IR data do not fully align with this structure.
- **Conclusion:** This option is unlikely due to the mismatch in NMR chemical shifts.

#### **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- Structure: A benzoic acid derivative with a chlorine atom at the para position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
- **IR:** The broad O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid fits the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ peak, and the C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **NMR:** The singlet at **11.0 ppm** matches the deshielded carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **Mass:** The molecular formula (C7H5ClO2) matches the molecular ion at **m/z = 156**, but the isotopic pattern (M at 100% and M+2 at 32%) does not align with the expected 75:25 ratio for Cl isotopes.
- **Conclusion:** This option fits the NMR and IR data well but has a discrepancy in the mass spectrometry.

#### **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**
- Structure: An ester with the formula Cl-CO-O-Ph.
- **IR:** The strong C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits the ester carbonyl, but there is no O-H group in this structure to explain the broad peak in the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ range.
- **NMR:** The aromatic protons would produce two doublets for a para-substituted benzene ring, which matches the data. However, there is no proton corresponding to the singlet at **11.0 ppm**, as this structure lacks a carboxylic acid group.
- **Mass:** The molecular formula (C8H7ClO2) matches the molecular ion at **m/z = 156**, but the absence of an O-H group makes this option inconsistent with the IR data.
- **Conclusion:** This option does not fully explain the spectral data.

#### **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- Structure: A benzoic acid derivative with a chlorine atom at the ortho position relative to the carboxylic acid group.
- **IR:** The O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid fits the 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ peak, and the C=O stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a carboxylic acid.
- **NMR:** The singlet at **11.0 ppm** matches the deshielded carboxylic acid proton, but the aromatic protons would not produce two simple doublets due to the ortho and meta substitution pattern.
- **Mass:** The molecular formula (C7H5ClO2) matches the molecular ion at **m/z = 156**, but the NMR data does not align with this structure.
- **Conclusion:** This option is unlikely due to the mismatch in NMR chemical shifts.

### Final Decision:
Based on the spectral data, **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid** is the most consistent with the NMR and IR data. While the mass spectrometry isotopic pattern does not perfectly match the expected Cl isotopic ratio, this discrepancy may be due to experimental or reporting artifacts. The other options fail to fully account for the spectral data.

**Answer: B**
