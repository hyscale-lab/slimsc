Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, what's a dithiocyanato complex? Oh right, that's probably the Co(SCN)_2 complex, so the one with two SCN- ligands. But wait, the question mentions "blue" dithiocyanato. I remember that Co with different SCN ligands can have different colors. But maybe that's besides the point; the question is about the concentration, not the color.

Stability constants (β) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. Each β corresponds to a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)_2, β3 for Co(SCN)_3, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4? Or wait, maybe I should clarify the order. Sometimes, the order is based on the order of formation, but I think each βn corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ligands. So:

- β1: Co(SCN)^- (probably Co(SCN) with one SCN)
- β2: Co(SCN)_2^(2-)
- β3: Co(SCN)_3^(3-)
- β4: Co(SCN)_4^(4-)

Wait, but the charges might matter. Co^2+ with SCN^- ligands: each SCN- is -1, so for each complex, the charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 -n. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0; n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But maybe that's not crucial for this problem. The
