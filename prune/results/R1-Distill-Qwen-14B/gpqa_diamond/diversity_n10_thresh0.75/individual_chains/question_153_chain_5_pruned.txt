Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing possible products for A, B, and C.

First, let me recall what the Michael addition is. The Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which then tautomerizes or loses a proton to form the product.

So, let's tackle each part one by one.

**Part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH â†’ (A)**

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile in the Michael reaction. It has the structure CH2(COOEt)2. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, but wait, no, wait. The formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; but in this case, it's substituted at the 3-position. So, it's CH2=CH-C(O)OEt with a p-tolyl group attached where? Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OEt, with the p-tolyl attached to the central carbon. So, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the carbonyl is at position 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(O-)-OEt but with the p-tolyl group attached to the central carbon. So actually, it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(C(O)OEt)-p-tolyl? No, let me think again.

Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(O)-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the beta position. Oh wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So, the substituent is at the gamma position? Or wait, the numbering might be different. So, for acrylate, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester group is on C3. So if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the p-tolyl group is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. But wait, that would make the double bond between C1 and C2, and the substituent on C3 (
