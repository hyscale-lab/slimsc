Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that in the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. And we're supposed to find how much distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame after 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, and we're ignoring gravity, rotation, and revolution, so those factors don't come into play.

Wait, wait. So the problem is about relative motion between two inertial frames. I remember that in special relativity, when things are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, what's the speed here? 60,000 km/s. Let me see, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of the speed of light. Oh, so it's a significant fraction but not extremely high. So maybe relativistic effects are noticeable here.

So, the key here is to figure out the relationship between time measured in the ejecta frame and the galaxy frame. Because the problem gives time in the ejecta's frame (50 seconds), but we need the distance in the galaxy's frame. Hmm, I think I need to find how much time has passed in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds have passed in the
