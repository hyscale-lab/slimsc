Okay, let me try to figure this chemistry problem out. So, I've got this series of reactions, and I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember that's part of molecular geometry, like the shapes of molecules and their symmetry.

Let me read the question again. So, solid A reacts with gas B in an 8:1 ratio to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with gas D (in a 2:1 ratio) to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, C reacts with water to give back A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. Lastly, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I'm thinking about what each reaction could be. Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: A + 8 B â†’ C. Solid reacting with gas to form a product. Maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen? But wait, 8 equivalents are used. That makes me think of something like a sulfide reacting with chlorine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide and B is a halogen. Or perhaps it's something like sulfur reacting with oxygen? No, but that wouldn't fit the 8 moles ratio.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is copper and B is sulfur. Because copper reacts with sulfur in a certain ratio. Wait, but 8 equivalents would be a lot. Alternatively, maybe A is sodium and B is chlorine? But sodium plus chlorine would form NaCl, but 8 equivalents? That's 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of Na? That doesn't seem right.

Hmm, another angle: the product C is bright red. Red products could be things like copper(II) sulfate is blue, but maybe something like mercury(I) chloride is red. Or perhaps it's a transition metal compound. Oh, wait, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but maybe another form? Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfur-based compound. Sulfur is bright yellow, but when it forms certain compounds, maybe it's red. Oh, wait, could C be FeS? No, that's black.

Wait, another thought. What about the product of a metal and sulfur? Like iron and sulfur makes FeS, which is black. Maybe it's not that. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate? Or maybe it's a reaction that forms a particular oxide. I'm not so confident here.

Let me think about the next reaction: C reacts with D to form E. C reacts with D (2 equivalents) to make E, which is dangerous. So what's E? Maybe C is a sulfide and D is chlorine or another halogen. Or maybe C is a carbonate reacting with a strong acid like HCl.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with water, it forms A, F, and G. So, perhaps C is a salt that undergoes hydrolysis. For example, like a sulfide reacting with water to form the metal hydroxide and H2S? Or maybe a nitride? Let's see, if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then reacting with water would produce Mg(OH)2 and NH4OH? Wait, but F is a strong acid and G is a
