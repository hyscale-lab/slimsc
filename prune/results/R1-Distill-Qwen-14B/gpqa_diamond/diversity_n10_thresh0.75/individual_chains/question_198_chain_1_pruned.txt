Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So the question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

Wait, and the stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, I need to remember what these β values represent. Stability constants (formation constants) are the equilibrium constants for the formation of a complex from its constituent ions. So for a complex like [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), the stability constant βn would be the equilibrium constant K for the reaction: Co^2+ + n SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), and βn = [complex]/([Co^2+][SCN^-]^n).

The problem is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ligands. So that would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2-? Wait, cobalt is Co^2+, and each SCN^- is -1. So two SCN
