Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, right? Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So first, I should probably figure out the new concentration after dilution. Oh wait, because when you mix volumes, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So initial volume is 20 cm³, initial concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. Hmm.

Wait, what's the equivalence point volume? The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me see.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M * 0.040 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001 moles. Because 20+20 is 40 cm³, right.

So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. But NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed would be 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, but the first part is 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, I should think about what happens at these points. Let's tackle each part one by one.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using the Kb of acetate. Let me see.

So, moles of acetate: 0.001 moles (since all the acetic acid is neutralized). The total volume at equivalence point is the initial volume of acetic acid solution plus the volume of NaOH added. So 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So, Kb for acetate is Kw/Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. Let's set up the expression.

Let x be the concentration of OH^- produced. So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x is much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02. Wait, but the options don't have 9.02. Hmm.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recalculate the Kb. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 /1.85e-5 = approx 5.405e-10, that's correct.

Acetate concentration is 0.02 M. So Kb = x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) = 4.98, so pH is 9.02. But none of the options have a pH near 9 at equivalence. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C)4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

Hmm, none of these have equivalence point pH around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me check again.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L (20 cm³) = 0.001 moles. Then, when we add 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, moles of NaOH are 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001. So yes, they neutralize each other. So acetate moles are 0.001, volume is 40 +10=50 cm³=0.05 L.

Concentration is 0.001/0.05=0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to consider activity coefficients or something, but that's probably beyond the scope here. Alternatively, maybe I should use the exact expression without the approximation.

Let me try the exact calculation.

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x). But since Kb is small, x is very small, so 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02. So initial approximation holds. So the pH should be around 9.02, which is not in the options. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the volume. Let me think again: initial volume of the acetic acid solution after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Then, when adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 50 cm³. So yes, 0.05 L. So that's correct.

Hmm, none of the options have a pH near 9. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Maybe I'm supposed to take into account that the solution is acetate ion and sodium ions. Sodium ions are spectator ions, so the pH is determined by the acetate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't at equivalence point but at some other point. Wait, but the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate. Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9. 1/1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so Kb is 5.405e-10, correct.

So perhaps the problem is not about the equivalence point. Let me see the options again. Option D says equivalence pH is 6.92, which is acidic. That can't be right because equivalence point of a weak acid should be basic. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me think: the problem says "dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water". So the initial concentration is 0.05 M, volume is 20 cm³, so moles is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles, correct. After adding 20 cm³, the volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the NaOH is 0.1 M, and the equivalence point is when 0.001 moles are added, so volume is 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. That's correct.

So why do the options not have a pH around 9? Hmm. Maybe the question is not about the equivalence point? Let me check the question again.

"what will be the value of pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point?" So I have to calculate both.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the pH at 25% titration first, maybe that's correct, and then think about the equivalence point.

At 25% titration, 25% of the required NaOH has been added. So required NaOH is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

At this point, how much NaOH has been added? 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 * 0.0025 = 0.00025 moles.

The initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. So after adding 0.00025 moles of NaOH, the reaction is:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume is initial 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approximately 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.737 (because log(1.85e-5) is about 4.737, wait no, wait: pKa = -log(Ka) = 4.737.

Wait, 1.85e-5 → log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733 → pKa is 4.733.

So plugging in the concentrations:

pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647 )

Let me calculate that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

So approximately 4.26. Looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value.

Now, equivalence point. As before, I calculated pH around 9.02, but that's not in the options. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate, which is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The acetate concentration is 0.02 M, as before. So the hydrolysis is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. Let me set up the expression again.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] = x

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 -x) = x² / (0.02 -x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 → 1.081e-11 → x ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is 4.98 → pH is 9.02. But none of the options have this.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial solution after adding 20 cm³ water: the acetic acid is 0.025 M, right? So when titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, correct. So at equivalence, the solution is 0.001 moles of acetate in 50 cm³. So 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximation.

x² = Kb * (0.02 -x) → which is x² + Kb x - (0.02 Kb) =0.

But Kb is very small, so x is much less than 0.02, so the approximation holds. So I think the calculation is correct, but the options don't match. So maybe the question is looking for the pH at 25% of the way to equivalence, which is what I calculated as 4.26, and the equivalence point as something else.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says equivalence pH is 6.92. That's in the 6.9 range, which is higher than 7, which would be basic. But if I calculate using the exact expression, let me see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles of acetate. Let me recalculate the acetate concentration.

At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001, total volume is 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L. So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but maybe the pH is being calculated using the formula for weak base. Let me think. So, the concentration is 0.02 M. Kb is 5.405e-10.

So, the concentration of OH- is sqrt(0.02 * Kb) = sqrt(0.02 *5.405e-10).

Wait, 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → sqrt(1.081e-11) is approx 1.04e-5, as before. So pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration after dilution is wrong. Let me recheck: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then adding 20 cm³ of water, volume is 40 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

Correct.

Wait, perhaps the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, but the volume used is 25% of what? Oh wait, the 25% is of the titration, i.e., 25% of the equivalence volume. So equivalence is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

Yes, that's what I did earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the solution after dilution is 40 cm³, but when you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L. So when I calculated the concentrations, I used 0.0425 L correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH, the moles is 0.00025 moles, correct.

So the buffer solution has 0.00075 moles of acetic acid and 0.00025 moles of acetate, in 0.0425 L.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M, [A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → 4.733 + log(0.005882/0.017647) → log(0.333) is -0.477, so pH ≈4.256, which is about 4.26. So that matches option A, which is 4.26; 8.52. But I thought the equivalence point was around 9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again. Another approach: maybe at equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution, which is a weak base. So the pH should be above 7.

Wait, but none of the options have an equivalence pH above 7 except option A, which is 8.52, and option D which is 6.92 (still below 7, which can't be right for a weak base).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point volume. Let me double-check.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles of NaOH needed is 0.001, volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So correct.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is using the exact solution without the approximation. Let's try that.

At equivalence point: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M. Kb = 5.405e-10.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Let x be [OH^-], then [CH3COOH] is x.

So, 5.405e-10 = x² / 0.02 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x=1.04e-5. So pOH=4.98, pH=9.02.

But none of the options have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the activity coefficients or use more precise log values. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the equivalence point but about the midpoint, but no, equivalence point is when all acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the initial volume. No, the question says 25% titration, which refers to 25% of the equivalence volume.

Wait, perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the acetic acid's initial concentration.

Wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, 20 cm³. Diluted with 20 cm³, so 0.025 M. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not just acetate but also some unreacted acetic acid. No, at equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm supposed to calculate the pH using the exact expression without the approximation. Let's try that.

In the solution at equivalence point:

The acetate hydrolysis equation is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial concentrations:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 M

[CH3COOH] = 0

[OH^-] = 0

Change:

- x → +x → +x

So, at equilibrium:

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x

[CH3COOH] = x

[OH^-] = x

So Kb = x² / (0.02 -x) =5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) = 1.04e-5.

So, [OH^-] =1.04e-5 → pOH=4.98 → pH=9.02.

But as I said, this isn't matching any of the options, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the equivalence point, perhaps the actual solution is different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not at 25% of the equivalence volume but 25% of the initial solution.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the initial acetic acid concentration.

Wait, but the question clearly states 25% titration, which refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the equivalence point is actually at a different pH. Let me think again: perhaps I should use the formula for a strong base titrating a weak acid. The pH at equivalence is determined by the concentration of the conjugate base.

Wait, but I've done that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact solution without approximation. Let's set up the equation:

x² = Kb (0.02 -x) → x² + Kb x - 0.02 Kb =0.

Using Kb=5.405e-10,

x² + (5.405e-10) x - (0.02)(5.405e-10) =0.

This is quadratic equation ax² +bx +c=0, where a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= - (0.02)(5.405e-10)= -1.081e-11.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)] / (2a).

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 -4(1)(-1.081e-11) = 2.92e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈ 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈ 6.576e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ±6.576e-6 ] /2.

Only positive solution makes sense: ( -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ) /2 ≈ (6.576e-6 )/2 =3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6.

[OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.485 → pH=8.515.

Ah! So the pH is approximately 8.52. That's option A's second value.

Wait, why did the approximation before give pH 9.02, but the exact solution gives 8.52? Because in the exact solution, x isn't ignored, so the approximation isn't as valid as I thought. Because for x=3.288e-6, 0.02 -x is approximately 0.01967, which is about 0.02, but perhaps the small x isn't negligible enough to ignore. So the exact calculation gives a lower pH than the approximate.

So, the pH at equivalence is around 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

So, putting it all together: 25% titration gives pH ~4.26, equivalence point pH ~8.52. So the answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ at a concentration of 0.05 M. After adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point. The moles of acetic acid after dilution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \times 0.04 = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Since the reaction with NaOH is \( 1:1 \), the moles of NaOH required for equivalence are also \( 0.001 \). Given the concentration of NaOH is \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \), the volume of NaOH needed is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At the equivalence point, all acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is calculated using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \), where \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \) and \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
K_b = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[OH^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \implies [OH^-]^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-].
\]

Substituting \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
[OH^-]^2 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
[OH^-] = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[OH^-] = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
\]

However, this value does not match the options provided. To resolve this, the exact quadratic solution is used for \( K_b \), leading to a slightly lower pH of approximately \( 8.52 \) at the equivalence point.

Next, we calculate the pH at 25% titration. At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is added, which corresponds to \( 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 \) of \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \) NaOH. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \times 0.0025 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COOH} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of CH}_3\text{COO}^- = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume is:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = 40 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log\left(\frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]}\right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \):

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log\left(\frac{0.00588}{0.01765}\right) \approx 4.733 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately \( 4.26 \).

Combining the results, the pH at 25% titration is \( 4.26 \), and the pH at the equivalence point is \( 8.52 \). This matches **Option A**.

Answer: A
