Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Okay, I remember that an eigenvector is a vector that only changes by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to it, and that scalar is the eigenvalue.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, I'll need to construct the operator P in the direction n, which is in the x-z plane. Wait, but the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so I guess the operator P would be a combination of Px and Pz. Since it's along an arbitrary direction in x-z, the direction can be represented as making an angle θ with the z-axis, maybe.

Wait, the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, so its components would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. But since we're dealing with 2x2 matrices, perhaps we're working in a spin-½ system, like spin in the x-z plane. Oh, right, because for electrons or muons, spin-½ systems are common.

The operator P is given as a vector operator, so P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny =0. So, P = n_x Px + n_z Pz. But n_x and n_z are related by the angle θ the direction makes with the z-axis. For example, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P would be (sinθ) * Px + (cosθ) * Pz.

Wait, but the question says to calculate the eigenvector for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator P is given along an arbitrary direction in x-z, so the eigenvector should correspond to the spin-up state along that direction.

Let me think about the structure of P. Each component of P is given as ħ/2 times a matrix. So, let me write down each of these:

Px = ħ/2 * [[
