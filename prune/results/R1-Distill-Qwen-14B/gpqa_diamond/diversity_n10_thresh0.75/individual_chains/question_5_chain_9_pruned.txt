Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down. So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue given is +ħ/2.

Hmm, wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix. So, I think P is the vector operator, meaning P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z. But wait, the direction is given as an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Oh right, so the direction vector n lies in the x-z plane. That means it can be represented with angles θ and φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So the direction is something like (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but since it's in x-z, φ is probably zero or 180, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating that part.

So, the operator P in the direction n would be P·n. Because when you have an operator along a direction, you take the dot product of the vector operator with the direction unit vector. So the operator we're interested in is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero, so P·n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

But wait, the eigenvalue for this operator is +ħ/2. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ> ?

Wait, no, because the operator P itself is each component multiplied by (ħ/2). So for example, P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator along n is P·n = (P_x n_x + P_z n_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^
