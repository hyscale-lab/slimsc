Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Also, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're told that the stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Wait, right. In LTE, the population of energy levels in atoms depends on temperature. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states. The formula I remember is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g_i and g_j are the degeneracies, E the energies, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference Î”E is given, and the ratio of excitation is 2:1 between star 1 and star 2. Let me clarify: it says the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited as in star 2. So, for the same element (iron), the ratio of their populations in a higher energy level compared to a lower one is 2 in star 1 and 1 in star 2, or is it the other way around?

Wait, the problem states that "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So, I think this refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state. So, for star 1, the ratio is higher than for star 2. So, n1_excited / n1_ground = 2 * (n2_excited / n2_ground).

But wait, the question says "twice as excited", so perhaps it's the relative excitation, meaning that the excitation in star1 is twice that in star2. So if the ratio for star1 is 2x, and for star2 is x, but wait the question says star1 is twice as excited as star2. Hmm, maybe I should model it as n1/n2 = 2, where n is the number in the excited state.

Wait let me think again. The problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice
