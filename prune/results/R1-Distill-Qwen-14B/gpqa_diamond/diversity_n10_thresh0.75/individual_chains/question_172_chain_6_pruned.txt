Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. It also mentions that both photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I guess the usual formulas for blackbody radiation or Boltzmann distribution apply here.

Wait, when they say the iron atoms are twice as excited, I think that refers to the excitation state. So maybe the number of atoms in a higher energy level compared to a lower one is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of two energy levels. The equation is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-Î”E/(kT)), where g's are the statistical weights, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

In this case, the ratio for star_1 is n1_upper/n1_lower = 2 times (n2_upper/n2_lower). Wait, no, because the question says star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. Let me denote for star_1: n1 = number in excited level, and for star_2, n2. The problem says that n1 is twice n2? Or is it the ratio n_upper/n_lower that's twice as much in star_1 as in star_2?

The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." I think that means, for that particular energy level, the number of excited atoms (in a higher state) is double. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation ratio is double.

Wait, probably it's the ratio of the number of atoms in the higher energy level to the lower that is higher. So for star_1, (n_upper / n_lower) is twice that of star_2.

So let me write that as:

(n_upper1 / n_lower1)
