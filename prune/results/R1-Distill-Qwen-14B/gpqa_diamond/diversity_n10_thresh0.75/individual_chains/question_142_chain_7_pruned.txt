Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is a classical mixture of the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states. Because each term has a coefficient of 1/2, the qubit is in a completely mixed state. So, it's like the qubit is equally likely to be found in state |0⟩ or |1⟩ when measured.

Now, I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. I remember that the Bloch sphere is a way to represent the state of a single qubit. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. But wait, what's the Bloch vector representation?

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. So, if I can rewrite the given ρ in this form, I can find the components of r.

Let's write out the Pauli matrices:
σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

The identity matrix I is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So, I + r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz, all multiplied by 1/2.

So the given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. 

|0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ becomes (1/2) * I.

Wait, that's interesting. So ρ is (I)/2. Comparing this to the general form, which is (I + r·σ)/2, I can equate the two. So (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives (r·σ)/2 = 0. Therefore, r·σ must be zero, which implies that r is the zero vector (0,0,0).

So the Bloch vector r is at the origin, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. That makes sense because for a completely mixed state, the qubit isn't pointing to any direction on the sphere's surface but is uniformly in all directions, hence at the center.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches this conclusion.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|
