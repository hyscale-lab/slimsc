Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm trying to figure out what the product is after a reaction between Compound X and red phosphorus with HI. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR and NMR data to determine what Compound X is. The IR data shows peaks around 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching, but since the options don't have any amines, maybe it's an O-H group, like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm⁻¹. The 1720 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O), so that makes me think of a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But in the NMR, there's a peak around 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton because they usually appear around 10-12 ppm as broad signals. So, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR spectrum: 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) is probably the COOH proton. Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) suggest a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Like a para-substituted benzene. The downfield shift at 8.0 ppm suggests an electron-withdrawing group, which fits with a carboxylic acid attached to the benzene.

The other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). Let me think about that. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is probably a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in a CH2CH2CH3 chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet with 3H could be a methyl adjacent to a CH, like CH(CH3)- something. The 2.9 and 1.7 are multiplets, maybe a CH and some adjacent CH2 groups. So putting that together, perhaps there's an isobutyl group attached somewhere.

Wait, but the benzene is para-substituted. So the benzene has two substituents, one being the carboxylic acid, and the other being a substituent that has this alkyl chain. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would be something like a benzene ring with a -COOH group and another substituent. Let me imagine the structure.

So maybe it's a para-substituted benzoic acid. The substituent on the benzene would be an isobutyl group, perhaps? Because the NMR shows a branching. Let me think about the groups.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which could be the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid. But wait, usually carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl peaks around 1700. Alternatively, if it's an ester, that could be higher. But the broad peak at 10.5 suggests it's a carboxylic acid. So, structure-wise, maybe it's 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, which doesn't fit because the benzene would be at position 2, but the NMR shows para substitution. Because in the NMR, the two doublets (d, 2H each) at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm suggest a para-substituted benzene. 

So, the benzene ring has two substituents opposite each other. One is a COOH group, and the other is a substituent that gives the NMR signals we saw.

Now, the substituent: the NMR signals at 2.9 ppm, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9. Let's think about this. The 0.9 triplet is a methyl group attached to something. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet, maybe a methyl attached to a CH, like in an isobutyl group.

Wait, let's think of the substituent structure. For the substituent attached to the benzene, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. So, the substituent would be (CH2)2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that
