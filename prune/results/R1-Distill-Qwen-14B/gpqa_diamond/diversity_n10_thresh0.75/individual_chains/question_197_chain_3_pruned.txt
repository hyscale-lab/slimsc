Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying a compound X and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI... I remember that usually, HI is a strong acid, and red phosphorus is often used in certain substitution reactions. Oh wait, maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction? Or perhaps a substitution?

First, I need to figure out what compound X is. The data given are IR and NMR. Let me look at the IR data first. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The other peaks: 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which is typical for esters, ketones, or carboxylic acids. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound probably has a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR now. The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which suggests an -OH proton, maybe from a carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. Then at 8.0 ppm, there's a doublet integrating for 2H. That's in the aromatic region, possibly para-substituted. The 7.2 ppm doublet is another 2H; that would fit with a para-substituted benzene. So maybe two substituents on the ring, one being a substituent with a carbonyl group.

Then there's a 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H), 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H), 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), and 0.9 ppm triplet (3H). Let's break that down. The 0.9 triplet is likely a methyl group attached to something that splits into a triplet. Maybe a CH2CH3? Then the 1.4 doublet (3H) could be a methyl attached to a CH. So, like a CH(CH3) group. The 1.7 multiplet (2H) is probably another CH2, maybe adjacent to that CH. The 2.9 multiplet (1H) could be that CH. So putting that together, maybe a chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached somewhere?

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene might be a carbonyl group. So, perhaps a benzene ring with a substituent that is an ester or a ketone. But wait, the IR has a 1720 cm-1 which is higher than a typical ketone (which is around 1700-1725). Wait, no, actually, carboxylic acids have lower wavenumbers, around 1700 as well. Wait, the 10.5 ppm in NMR suggests a carboxylic acid, but then the 1720 might be that. Alternatively, an ester's carbonyl is usually around 1720-1740, right? So if it's a carbonyl at 1720, maybe it's an ester.

But wait, the IR has a 3400-2500, which could be O-H from a carboxylic acid, but if the compound is an ester, the O-H would be from the acid, but if it's an ester, the O-H would be absent. Wait, no, maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Let me think again.

Looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is broad, probably an -OH. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR should have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which it does. The 1720 would then be the C=O of the carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids typically have lower carbonyl peaks than esters. Wait, no, actually, esters have higher wavenumbers than carboxylic acids. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: Esters usually have C=O around 1720-1740 cm⁻¹, while carboxylic acids are around 1700-1725, but can vary. So if the peak is at 1720, it could be either, but the presence of a broad O-H in NMR points more towards a carboxylic acid.

So, putting it together, the compound is a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent has a carbonyl group, an -OH, and a chain attached. Now, the NMR substituents: the 10.5 ppm is a single proton, so maybe a meta-substituted ring? Or perhaps the substituent is a carboxylic acid group with a long chain.

Wait, the aromatic protons in NMR are 8.0 and 7.2, both doublets with 2H each. That suggests a para-substituted benzene, with the substituent being at the para position. So the substituent is a group attached to the ring at the para position, and the other two substituents are the H's on the ring.

The substituent attached to benzene would then have a chain. The NMR signals suggest a chain like -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, let's see. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH adjacent to another group. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 attached to the CH. Then the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. And 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

So putting that together, the substituent would be a group like:

CH2CH(CH2CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no, because the substituent on the benzene would be a benzylic group. Wait, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached through a carbonyl? Or perhaps a butyl group.

Wait, another approach: the substituent could be an ethyl group attached to a carbonyl. Let's imagine the structure.

Wait, but the substituent on the benzene may be a carbonyl group with a chain. For example, a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an alkyl chain. But the presence of an -OH at 10.5 ppm complicates that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carboxylic acid group attached to a benzene ring, along with a chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propionoic acid group. Like 4-(propyl)benzoic acid. Or maybe 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is typically a methyl group attached to a CH2. So that would be like CH2CH(CH3) something. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl attached to a CH. So perhaps structure is CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, let me try to build the substituent. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring, perhaps
