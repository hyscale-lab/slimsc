Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about an electron state and measuring the probability of being in certain eigenstates. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Right, so |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states. So, the state is a linear combination of these.

First, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional. To find the actual state, I'll calculate the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the inner product of |alpha> with itself must be 1.

Let me write the state as |alpha> = c1 |up> + c2 |down>, where c1 = (1+i) and c2 = (2-i). The normalization factor is 1/sqrt(|c1|^2 + |c2|^2).

Calculating |c1|^2: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 +1 = 2. So |c1|^2 is 2.

|c2|^2: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 + 2i - 2i -i^2 = 4 +1 =5. So |c2|^2 is 5.

Adding them together, 2+5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. So, since it's a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. That would look like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j. For a 2x2 matrix, that means A12 and A21 are hbar/2, and A11 and A22 are 0. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]].

I think this operator is related to the Pauli matrices. Let me recall the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the Pauli Y matrix is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The given operator's matrix looks like (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because Pauli X has 0s on diagonal and 1s off-diagonal.

So the operator is (hbar/2) σx, where σx is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the eigenstates of σx are the eigenstates of the given operator. So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of σx.

Wait, but another approach is to find the expectation value of the operator, which is the average value. But the question also asks for the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate. Wait, no, the operator's eigenstates aren't necessarily |up> and |down>. Because |up> is the eigenstate of Sz, not Sx.

So the operator in question has eigenstates that are eigenstates of σx, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), perhaps. Let me confirm.

The eigenstates of σx are the superpositions of |up> and |down>. Because σx is the spin-x operator, its eigenstates are the states with definite spin in the x-direction.

Let me denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). These are the eigenstates of σx with eigenvalues +1 and -1, respectively. So the operator A in the problem is (hbar/2) σx. So, the eigenvalues of A are (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1).

So, when we make a measurement of A, the possible outcomes are ± hbar/2, corresponding to the eigenstates |+x> and |−x>.

The probability of measuring each eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> and find the coefficients.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the projections.

Let me write |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x>
