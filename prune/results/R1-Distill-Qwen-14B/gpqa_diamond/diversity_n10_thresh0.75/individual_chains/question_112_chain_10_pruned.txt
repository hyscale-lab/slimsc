Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the probabilities and the average value of an operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means it's equal to some constant multiplied by this vector. Oh right, probably it's normalized, so we'll need to find the normalization factor first.

First, I should calculate the normalization. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are orthonormal. So the norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

Coefficient for |up> is (1+i), so its absolute square is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Coefficient for |down> is (2 - i), so absolute square is (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 +1=5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator in question has matrix elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else 0. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2. Let me write it out:

The operator matrix is:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   0 ]

Because for iâ‰ j, A_ij is hbar/2, otherwise zero. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, wait, this looks familiar. That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]], so yes.

Wait, but wait. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So A matrix is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x. Interesting.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, but the operator's eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates,
