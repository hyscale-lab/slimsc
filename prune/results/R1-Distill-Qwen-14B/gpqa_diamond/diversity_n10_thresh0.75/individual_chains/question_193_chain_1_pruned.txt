Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is equal to 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. Oh wait, right, plx in arcseconds is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/r.

So if I have N proportional to 1/(plx)^5, let's substitute plx with 1/r. Let me write that out.

N ‚àù 1/( (1/r) )^5

Because plx is 1/r, so substituting gives me 1/( (1/r)^5 ). Let's simplify that.

1/( (1/r)^5 ) is the same as r^5. Because when you invert 1/r to the fifth power, it becomes r^5/(1^5) which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So it's about the change in N with r. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the rate of change (the
