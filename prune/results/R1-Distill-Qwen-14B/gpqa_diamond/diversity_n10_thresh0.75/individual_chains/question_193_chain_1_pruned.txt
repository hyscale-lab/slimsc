Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, mathematically, that would be N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So, I need to find how N depends on r, the distance.

Hmm, okay. I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is plx = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So, plx is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs.

Wait, if plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So, plx is in arcseconds, and r is in parsecs. So, if I have a parallax value, I can find the distance by taking the reciprocal.

The number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. So, N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/r. So, 1/(plx)^5 becomes (r)^5. Because 1/( (1/r) )^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait a minute, so if N is proportional to r^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. But the question is about how the number changes per unit range of distance. That's the rate of change, right? So it's the derivative of N with respect to r.

Oh wait, no, maybe not. Wait, let me think. The problem says how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So, it's not the derivative but the scaling. Like, if you go from r to r+Δr, what happens to N?

Wait, no. The question is about how the number of stars in that region changes with distance. So, the way it's phrased, the number varies as 1/plx^5, which translates to r^5. So, the number of stars increases as the distance to the fifth power.

But wait, that
