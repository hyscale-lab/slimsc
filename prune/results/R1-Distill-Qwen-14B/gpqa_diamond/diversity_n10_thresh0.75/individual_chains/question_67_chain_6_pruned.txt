Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says: Two electrons are in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are both 1 for each electron, right? Because p orbitals have l=1. Then, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z and getting eigenvalues of -ħ each. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ. I need to find the probability of that happening.

Hmm. Let me think about angular momentum coupling. When you have two particles with angular momenta l1 and l2, the total angular momentum can be from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Here, l1 and l2 are 1 each, so the total l can be 0, 1, or 2. But in this case, the state is coupled to l=2, m=-1.

Wait, but the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, so that's a specific coupled state. So, the two electrons' angular momenta are combined to give total angular momentum L=2 and m=-1.

Now, the problem is about measuring L1z and L2z. These are the individual z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum. Each Lz can take values m multiplied by ħ. So, for each electron, Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ since l=1.

The possible eigenvalues for L1z and L2z are -ħ, 0, ħ each. The question is the probability that both L1z and L2z are measured as -ħ. So, the joint measurement outcome is (-ħ, -ħ).

I remember that when you have a coupled state, it's a linear combination of the product states of the individual angular momenta. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed as a combination of |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2> states, such that m1 + m2 = M, which here is -1.

Wait, but the total m is -1. So, m1 + m2 = -1. For each electron, m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, or +1.

So, the possible (m1, m2) pairs that add up to -1 are:
- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)
Because (-1) + 0 = -1 and 0 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, but what about other possibilities? Like ( -1, 0) and (0, -1), but any others? Let's see: 1 + (-2) would not be possible because m2 can't be -2 when l2=1. So, only those two possibilities.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |1, -1>⊗|1, 0> and |1,0>⊗|1, -1>. The exact coefficients would depend on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, I think.

But wait, the coupled state is symmetric or antisymmetric? Electrons are fermions, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But wait, the problem says to ignore spin, so maybe we don't have to worry about that in this part. But wait, the orbital angular momentum and spin are separate, so maybe the spin isn't considered here, so perhaps the angular momentum state is not antisymmetrized. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that affects this particular problem.

But wait, in this problem, we're given that the state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a specific coupled state. So
