Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm not exactly sure where to start, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and asks for their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. Oh wait, c is the speed of light, so we're definitely dealing with special relativity here.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract the speeds normally. I think you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, because velocities don't just add up linearly in relativity.

So the formula for relative velocity is (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I'm getting this right. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, but wait, from whose perspective are we calculating the relative speed? Oh wait, the question says their relative speed, so I think it's how fast one sees the other moving. Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, but which one is the reference frame? Oh, I think the relative speed is the speed of one from the other's frame. So, let's say we're in the frame of astronaut A, calculating the speed of astronaut B. Or the other way around.

So, if astronaut A is moving at velocity u = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at velocity v = 0.5c, but from the perspective of A, what is B's velocity?

Wait, no, maybe I should think about it differently. The problem states that both are moving in the same direction. So for relative velocity, I can imagine that from A's frame, B is moving at (v') where v' is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think about the formula again. The relative velocity formula is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but I have to be careful about the direction. Since both are moving in the same direction, say along the x-axis, and astronaut A is at 0.6c, and B is slower at 0.5c, then from A's frame, B is moving slower. Wait, or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me get the formula straight. The relative speed of B as seen from A's frame is (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). Because in the frame of A, the speed of B is v' = (v_B - u)/(1 - (u v_B)/c²), where u is A's speed in the lab frame. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, considering that if the lab frame is the one where the speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the
