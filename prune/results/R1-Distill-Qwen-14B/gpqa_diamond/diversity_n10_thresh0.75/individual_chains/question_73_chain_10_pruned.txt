Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, so the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just subtract them normally like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Wait, which one is u and which is v here? Since both are moving in the same direction, I think u is the velocity of one as observed from the other's frame. Or wait, maybe I should get the frame where one is stationary and the other is moving.

Wait, let me think. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what speed is B moving? Or vice versa.

Wait, actually, the relative speed would be the difference between their speeds, but adjusted for relativity. Because in relativity, velocities don't just subtract normally. So the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So let me plug in the numbers. Let's say u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So plugging in, (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Calculating the numerator: 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) => 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/0.7 = approximately 0.142857c. So about 0.14c, right? Looking at the options, both option C and D have 0.14c. So that's one part done.

Now for the total energy. The total energy of each astronaut is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². But wait, each astronaut's rest mass is different. So astronaut A has mass 2m, moving at 0.6c; astronaut B has mass 3m, moving at 0.5c.

So let's compute the energy for each. The formula is E = gamma * m_rest * c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For astronaut A: v = 0.6c. So gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E_A = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 mc².

For astronaut B: v = 0.5c. Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E_B ≈ 1.1547 * 3
