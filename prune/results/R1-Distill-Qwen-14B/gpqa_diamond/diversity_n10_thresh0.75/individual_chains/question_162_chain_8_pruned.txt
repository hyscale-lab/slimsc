Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like it's in two dimensions, right? Because dx and dy are the differentials. So the metric is for a 2D surface.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is like the hyperbolic plane, isn't it? Or maybe in this context, it's a specific metric.

Wait, but the question refers to the area of the pseudosphere. Hmm. So I think the area would depend on the geometry described by the given metric.

Let me try to recall how to compute the area using the metric. In differential geometry, the area element dA is given by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor (the metric components) times dxdy. So if I can find the metric tensor g, compute its determinant, take the square root, and then integrate over the region.

The metric here is written as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So if I represent this as g_{ij}, the metric tensor would have components g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms g_xy and g_yx are zero. So the metric is diagonal.

So the determinant of the metric tensor g is (g_xx)(g_yy) - (g_xy)^2. Since g_xy is zero, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²))². Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, the determinant for a diagonal metric is the product of the diagonal components. So g = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) * (32/(4 - x² - y²)) ) = (32)^2 / (4 - x² - y²)^2.

Wait, but the area element dA is sqrt(det g) dx dy. So sqrt of (32^2)/(4 - x² - y²)^2) is 32/(4
