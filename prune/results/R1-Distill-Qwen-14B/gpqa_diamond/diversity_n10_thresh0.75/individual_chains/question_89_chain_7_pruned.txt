Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction to form alkenes. Wait, but this is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Oh wait, wait. Adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in a way that allows them to be on the same face or opposite faces. Oh, right, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the bromines are on opposite faces because of the structure of adamantane. Hmm, but when KOH is used, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Wait no, because elimination usually forms alkenes, but wait, adamantane is already a diamondoid structure. So heating with KOH in excess—probably an E2 mechanism. But wait, if the two bromines are on non-adjacent carbons, would elimination even be possible? Oh wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the two Br are on carbons 1 and 3. Are those adjacent? Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is like a diamond cubic structure, with each carbon connected to four others. So 1 and 3 might be two carbons that are two steps apart; perhaps they are not adjacent. So wait, if they're not adjacent, elimination to form a double bond isn't possible. So what else could happen? Oh, maybe elimination isn't possible, and another reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to a substitution. Wait, but with two bromides, maybe it's a double elimination? Or maybe each Br undergoes substitution, but KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Wait, but substitution would require a good leaving group and a nucleophile. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group? But then the product would be 1,3-dihydroxyl adamantane. But wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Hmm, but the IR spectrum shows an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So
