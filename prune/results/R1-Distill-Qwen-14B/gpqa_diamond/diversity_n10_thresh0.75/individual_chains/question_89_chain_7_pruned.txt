Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best. 

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C gives product 1, which is a light yellow solid. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. I remember that IR peaks around 1700 usually indicate a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The 1H NMR data for product 1 includes a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is probably an -OH or an ether or something with deshielded protons. Then there are some other signals: 2.41-2.23 (10H) and 1.94 (2H). 

Wait, but let me think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination reaction. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would be on the same face or opposite? Hmm, but when you eliminate two Br- groups, perhaps it's forming an alkene. Wait, but elimination usually requires adjacent leaving groups. In dibromides, if they're on adjacent carbons, you can get an elimination to form a double bond. Alternatively, maybe dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, but the product is a solid, and the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh wait, maybe it's a substitution reaction where the Br is replaced with an -OH group. But if both Brs are replaced, you could form an alcohol. But wait, the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl, so maybe it's forming a ketone. How does that happen?

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with two Br's. So two eliminations would give a diene? Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution, but then why
