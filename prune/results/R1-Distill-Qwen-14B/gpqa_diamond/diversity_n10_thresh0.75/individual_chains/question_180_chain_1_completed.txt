Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible. So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that electric potential energy is involved here. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But wait, since we're dealing with multiple charges, I think the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Wait, but in this case, one charge is fixed at point P, and the others are at 2 meters from P. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 m from it. Oh, but wait, the 12 charges are themselves constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is located.

Wait, so the setup is that the 13th charge is at the center, and the 12 charges are arranged in some way around it, each at a distance of 2 meters. But perhaps their exact arrangement doesn't matter because we're considering the potential energy between each pair.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system, so all the potential energies between every pair contribute to the total. But wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, so each is at 2m from the 13th charge. But how about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Since they are all identical and at the same distance from P, maybe their mutual distances are such that they form some kind of regular structure, but since their exact positions aren't specified beyond being 2m from P, perhaps we can assume they're all so far apart that their mutual interactions are negligible. Or wait, but if they're all at a radius of 2m from P, then the distance between any two of them would be... let's see, if they're on a sphere, then the distance between two points on a sphere of radius r is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the angle between them. But without knowing how they're arranged, it's hard to calculate the mutual distances. Hmm, but the problem doesn't mention any constraints beyond each being at 2m from P. So maybe the question is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th one at P, and not the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, that might make sense because the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So perhaps the mutual potential energies between the 12 charges are not considered, which would simplify the problem. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

The problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum energy occurs when all the charges are as close as possible to each other, but in this case, they are constrained to be 2m from P. So the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. Wait, but the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but nothing about their mutual distances. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged at the vertices of a regular dodecahedron or something, but the exact arrangement isn't given. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 12 and the 13th charge, not their mutual interactions.

That would make the calculation easier. So each of the 12 charges is interacting only with the 13th charge at a distance of 2 meters. So the potential energy for each of the 12 charges would be U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / 2m, because each of the 12 is 2e, and the 13th is also 2e.

Wait, but wait: the formula for the potential energy between two charges is U = k*(q1*q2)/r. So each pair would contribute that. So for each of the 12 charges, the potential with the 13th is k*(2e)(2e)/(2m). Since there are 12 such pairs, the total potential energy would be 12 * k*(2e)^2/(2m).

Wait, but wait, e is the elementary charge, 1.6e-19 coulombs. Let me calculate that.

Wait, but wait again. The problem states that all particles have charge 2e. So the 13th charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. So each pair contributes k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/m.

So for each of the 12 charges, the potential energy with the 13th is 2k e²/m. So total potential energy from all 12 would be 12 * (2k e²/m) = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed, so perhaps each of the 12 contributes a potential energy with the 13th. So that's 12 terms of (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m). Each such term is (k*(4e²))/(2m) = 2k e²/(m). So 12 * 2 k e²/(m) = 24 k e²/m.

But wait, potential energy is often considered as the energy required to assemble the system, so perhaps the 13th charge is fixed, and we bring the 12 charges into place. Each of the 12 charges would interact with the 13th, so each contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) = (4k e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/(m) per charge. 12 charges make 24k e²/m.

So the total potential energy would be 24 * k * e² / (2m) ?

Wait, no, m is 2 meters, right. So r is 2 meters.

So let's write it: U = 12 * (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ) 

Wait, no, because each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from the 13th. So each has a potential energy of (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m) = (4 k e²)/(2m) ) = 2 k e²/m.

So 12 charges: 12 * 2 k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

Wait, but wait a second. The formula for potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r. So the 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 charges is placed at 2m from it. So each contributes (k*(2e)*(2e))/(2m). Since there are 12 such charges, multiply by 12.

So U = 12 * [k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m)] = 12 * [4 e² k/(2m)] = 12 * [2 e² k/m] = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, but wait, 12 * 4 e² k/(2m) is 12 * (2 e² k / m) = 24 e² k/m.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the calculation. Let me make it step by step.

Each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e. The 13th charge is 2e. The distance between each is 2m.

Potential energy for each pair is U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) ) 

Which simplifies to U_i = (4 e² k) / (2m) ) = 2 e² k / m.

So each pair contributes 2 e² k / m.

Since there are 12 such pairs, the total U is 12 * 2 e² k / m = 24 e² k / m.

Wait, but wait, why are we considering each of the 12 as a pair with the 13th? Because each of the 12 is interacting with the 13th, but the 13th is fixed, so each of the 12 contributes a U of 2 e² k / m.

So the total is 24 e² k / m.

But wait, what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and they're all at 2m from P. But their mutual distances are something else. For example, if two of them are placed near each other, their mutual potential would be U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(distance between them). But the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but not necessarily how close they are to each other. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So perhaps the minimum energy occurs when the 12 charges are as close as possible to each other, thereby minimizing their mutual potential energy. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energies between each of the 12 and the 13th, and not their mutual interactions. Because if we have to compute all possible pairs, including the 12 with each other, that would complicate things a lot. But the problem does not give any information about their arrangement beyond being 2m from P. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the potential energies between the 12 charges and only consider their interactions with the 13th charge.

That would make the problem solvable. So, the total potential energy would be the sum of each of the 12 charges' potential with the 13th charge.

So, proceeding with that, let's compute.

Constants:

e = elementary charge = 1.602 × 10^-19 coulombs.

k = Coulomb's constant = 8.988 × 10^9 N m²/C².

r = 2 meters.

Each charge is 2e, so q = 2e.

Each pair (of 12) contributes U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / r.

So U_i = (4 e² k) / r.

Wait, no, wait: because each pair is between the 13th charge and each of the 12. So each U_i is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ) = (4 e² k) / (2m) ) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, perhaps I should write it as:

Each U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) ) 

Which is (4 e² k) / (2m) ) = 2 e² k / m.

So for each of the 12 charges, that's 12 * (2 e² k / m).

So total U = 12 * (2 e² k) / (2) )? Wait, no, because m is 2 meters. So substituting m=2 meters.

Wait, no, the distance r is 2 meters. So U_i = (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2) ) = (4 k e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Wait, because (2e)^2 is 4e^2, and denominator is r=2.

So U_i = (4 k e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

Wait, so each pair contributes 2 k e².

But wait, no, because each U_i is (k q1 q2 ) / r. So q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2m.

So U_i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) ) = (4 k e² ) / 2 = 2 k e². So each of the 12 charges contributes 2 k e².

So total U = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, that's a big number. Let me compute it numerically.

Let me plug in the numbers:

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So U = 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let's compute e squared first.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = approx (2.566e-38) C².

So U = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 24 * 8.988e9 = let's see, 24 * 8.988 is about 215.712e9 → 2.15712e11.

Then multiply by 2.566e-38: 

2.15712e11 * 2.566e-38 = (2.15712 * 2.566) * 1e(11-38) )

Compute 2.15712 * 2.566 ≈ 5.539.

So 5.539e-27 Joules.

Wait, but wait a minute. That's 24 * (k e²) with r=2.

Wait, but earlier I thought U_i was 2 k e². So 24 * 2 k e² is 48 k e². Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, no. Wait, U_i is 2 k e² for each of the 12 charges, so 12 * 2 k e² is 24 k e².

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, U_i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) → (4 k e²) / (2m) → 2 k e²/m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2 k e² / 2 = k e². Oh wait, that's right! So each of the 12 charges contributes U_i = (4 k e²) / (2) ) = 2 k e².

Wait, no. No, because r is 2 meters, so U_i = [k (2e)(2e)] / (2) ) = (4 k e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So each U_i is 2 k e², and 12 of them would be 24 k e².

So U_total = 24 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, but let me compute that correctly.

Compute e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2=2.566, so 2.566e-38.

k * e² = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that:

8.988e9 is 8.988 x 1e9.

Multiplying by 2.566e-38 gives:

8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 22.97.

So 22.97e(9-38) → 22.97e-29.

Which is 2.297e-28.

Then multiply by 24:

24 * 2.297e-28 = approximately 55.13e-28 → 5.513e-27 J.

Wait, but the options are in the range of 1e-26 to 1e-27. So 5.5e-27 would be approx 5.5e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, option B is 2.822e-26, option A is 5.645e-26.

Wait, but I'm getting around 5.5e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27) but not exactly.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me redo the steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents. Let's compute it more precisely.

Compute each part step by step.

Compute e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared: (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 x 1e-38.

1.602176634^2 ≈ 2.56697.

So e² ≈ 2.56697e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So k * e² = 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56697e-38.

Multiply 8.9875517879e9 by 2.56697e-38:

= (8.9875517879 * 2.56697) x 1e(9-38)

Calculate 8.98755 * 2.56697 ≈ let's compute:

≈ 8.98755 * 2.56697:

Well, 8 * 2.567 is approx 20.536, 0.98755 * 2.567 is approx ~2.542. So total approx 23.078.

So 23.078e-29 → 2.3078e-28.

Wait, 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So k*e² ≈ 2.3078e-28 J·m (Wait, no, because U has units of J).

Wait, no, the units would be correct because N·m²/(C²) * C² → N·m² → N·m is Joule.

So, each U_i is (2e)*(2e) *k / (2m) → 4e²k/(2m) = 2 e² k / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 2 e² k / 2 → e² k.

Wait, wait a second, that's a mistake. Let's re-examine:

Each U_i is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m) ) → (4 e² k) / (2m) ) → 2 e² k / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters. So 2 * e² k / (2) = e² k.

Wait, that's a big simplification! So each of the 12 charges contributes U_i = e² k.

Because 2/(2) is 1. So each U_i is e² k = (e^2)*k.

So total U is 12 * e² k.

So U_total = 12 * (1e-19 C)^2 * 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Wait, but wait, e is 1.602e-19 C, so e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So U_i = 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 2.307e-28 J.

Each of the 12 charges contributes that, so total U is 12 * 2.307e-28 = 27.684e-28 J → 2.7684e-27 J.

Wait, but earlier calculation with the corrected approach gives 2.768e-27 J, which is approximately 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher than our 2.77e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I compute the potential energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairs. Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed, and each of the 12 charges is at 2m from it. So each of the 12 contributes a pair with the fixed charge.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that the 13th charge is fixed, so when calculating the potential energy added by each of the 12, each contributes (k * q * Q) / r, where Q is the fixed charge (2e) and q is each of the 12 (2e).

So the potential energy for each is (k * 2e * 2e) / 2m.

Which is (4 e² k) / (2m) ) = 2 e² k / m.

But m is 2, so 2 e² k/(2) = e² k.

So each contributes e² k, and 12 of them would be 12 e² k.

Wait, so U_total = 12 * e² k.

Wait, then that's 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 * 8.988e9.

Compute:

1.602e-19 squared is 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988 = approx 23.07, so 23.07e-29 → 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2.307e-28 = 27.68e-28 → 2.768e-27 J.

So approximately 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26 → 5.6e-26.

B) 2.822e-26 → 2.8e-26.

C)7.056e-27 → ~7e-27.

D) 122.330 → way larger.

So the closest option would be option B is 2.82e-26, which is an order of magnitude higher than our computed 2.77e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the arithmetic.

Wait, let's compute U_total as 12 * e² *k.

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

Multiply e² *k: 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988 = approx 23.07, so 23.07e-29 (since 1e-38 *1e9 = 1e-29).

So 23.07e-29 → 2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 * 2.307e-28 = 27.68e-28 → 2.768e-27 J.

So the total U is approximately 2.77e-27 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher than this.

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. Because if they are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are much closer, their mutual potential energy could be significant.

Wait, but the problem statement says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. It says nothing about their mutual distances, so perhaps they are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are very large, so their mutual potential energies are negligible. Therefore, the total potential energy is just the sum of their interactions with the 13th charge.

But if that's the case, then the answer I computed, 2.77e-27 J, isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, wait another idea: perhaps the formula for the potential energy of a system of multiple charges is the sum of all unique pairs. So in this case, the 13th charge is fixed, and the other 12 are each interacting with it, so 12 terms. But what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves?

Ah, right! I think I forgot to account for the potential energy between the 12 charges. Since each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and they're all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary. But since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, perhaps we should assume that they are all at the same point, or perhaps arranged in a way that all mutual interactions contribute. But that complicates things.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum energy. The minimum energy would occur when the potential energy is as low as possible. For like charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But if they are constrained to be 2m from P, but can move on the sphere of radius 2m, perhaps the minimum mutual potential energy occurs when they're as far apart as possible, minimizing repulsion.

Wait, but if the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, then the maximum distance between any two would be the diameter, 4m. So that would minimize their mutual potential energy (since U is positive for like charges, so maximum separation would give the lowest U between each pair).

But this is getting complicated, and perhaps the intended answer doesn't include the mutual terms. So perhaps the problem expects only the interactions with the 13th charge to be considered.

In that case, the potential energy would be 2.77e-27 J, but that's not any of the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k*(2e)^2)/(2m), but perhaps I've made a mistake in the math.

Wait, another approach: each pair between the 13th charge (2e) and each of the 12 (2e) contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = (4 e² k)/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So each U_i is 2 e² k/m.

But m is 2m, so 2 e² k/(2m) = e² k/m. Wait, no, m is 2, so 2 e² k/(2) = e² k.

Wait, so each pair contributes e² k. And 12 such pairs would give 12 e² k.

Which is 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9 → 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 12 → 27.68e-28 → 2.768e-27 J.

So that's the same as before.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C (7.056e-27) and option B (2.822e-26). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each charge is 2e, and perhaps the 13th charge is also part of the system, so the calculation should include the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12, but maybe the 13th is fixed, so it doesn't contribute any potential energy beyond that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 13th charge is fixed, so when bringing the 12 charges into place, each contributes U = (k * 2e * 2e)/(2m).

Which is 4 e² k/(2m) → 2 e² k/m.

Since m is 2m, 2 e² k/(2m) = e² k/m. Wait, no: m is 2, so 2 e² k/(2) → e² k.

So each contributes e² k, 12 contribute 12 e² k.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives 12 * e² k = 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

Which is 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 12 * 23.07e-29 = 276.8e-29 → 2.768e-27 J.

Which is about 2.77e-27 J.

Wait, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.56 times higher than our value. Could that be because I missed a factor of 2?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let's go back to the formula for potential energy.

The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So in this case, we have the 13th charge (q13) and each of the 12 charges (q1 to q12). So each of the 12 charges interacts with q13, contributing U = k * q13 * q_i / r.

But wait, each of the 12 is interacting with the 13th, so that's 12 interactions. But the problem is that the 13th charge is fixed, so when assembling the system, adding each of the 12 charges involves bringing each from infinity to 2m. The work done is the potential energy added.

So, each charge's potential energy would be U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) → 4 e² k/(2m) → 2 e² k/m.

But m is 2. So U_i = 2 e² k/(2) → e² k.

Wait, so each of the 12 contributes e² k. So total U is 12 * e² k.

Which would be 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9 = 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

As before, 12 * 2.307e-28 → 2.768e-27.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 13th charge is not counted as part of the potential energy? No, because it's part of the system.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the potential energy in terms of electron volts, but no, the options are in Joules.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Wait, let's compute it again more carefully.

e = 1.602176634e-19 C.

e squared: (1.602176634e-19)^2 = (1.602176634)^2 x (1e-19)^2 = 2.56697 x 1e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

So e² *k = 2.56697e-38 *8.9875517879e9 = 2.56697 *8.98755e( -38 +9 ) = 22.97e-29 → 2.297e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 12 *2.297e-28 = 27.56e-28 → 2.756e-27 J.

Hmm, again, same result. So perhaps the correct answer is 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option. The closest option is C) 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement. It says the 13th charge is fixed, and the others are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So the 13th is at P, and others are each 2m away.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all possible pairs, including the pairs among the 12 charges. Since each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and j (both being 2e).

But without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to calculate. But perhaps the problem expects us to consider the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges as well, assuming they are at some average distance, or perhaps in a regular configuration.

Wait, but the problem says 'minimum energy' of the system. So perhaps the minimum occurs when the mutual potential energies are as small as possible, which would happen when the charges are as far apart as possible. For 12 charges on a sphere of radius 2m, the maximum separation would be when they are as far apart as possible, but without specific positions, it's hard to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energies are negligible, which would mean the total U is just the sum of the 12 interactions with the 13th charge. But that brings me back to the earlier calculation of 2.76e-27 J, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge. The problem says each charge is 2e, so each is twice the elementary charge.

Wait, let me re-calculate the formula correctly.

Each U between the 13th charge and one of the 12:

U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) ) 

= (4 e² k) / (2m) )

= 2 e² k / m.

Since m is 2 meters, U_i = 2 e² k / 2 = e² k.

So each U_i is e² k.

12 of them: 12 e² k.

Which is 12 * (e²) * k.

e is 1.602e-19 C.

e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

So e² *k = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 12: 27.68e-28 → 2.768e-27 J.

Which is 2.768 ×1e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2.56.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 13th charge is also part of the potential energy calculation. But since it's fixed, perhaps it's considered as being in place, so only the 12 charges are being brought into position. But that shouldn't change the calculation because each of the 12 interacts with the 13th.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of k. Let me recheck Coulomb's constant.

Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N m²/C². So I think that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k q1 q2 ) / r, but for each of the 12 charges, q1 is 2e and q2 is 2e, and r is 2m. So each pair contributes (4 e² k) / (2m) = 2 e² k/m.

Then, 12 pairs would contribute 12 * 2 e² k/m.

With m=2, that's 12 * 2 e² k/(2) ) = 12 e² k.

Wait, that's the same as before. So 12 e² k.

Which is 12 * (1.602e-19)^2 *8.988e9.

Which is 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 → 12 * 2.307e-28 → 2.768e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-evaluate each step.

The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

The 13th charge is fixed at P, and each of the 12 is at 2m from P.

So, U is the sum of the potential energies of each of the 12 charges with the 13th. Since the 13th is fixed, each of the 12 contributes a term of U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m).

Calculating each U_i:

U_i = k * (2e)^2 / (2m) → (4 e² k) / (2m) → 2 e² k/m.

Since m is 2, U_i = 2 e² k/(2) = e² k.

So each of the 12 charges contributes e² k, so total U = 12 * e² k = 12 e² k.

Compute this:

e =1.602e-19 C.

e² → 2.566e-38 C².

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

12 * e² *k = 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

Compute 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988 = approx 23.07, so 23.07e-29 → 2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 12 → 27.684e-28 → 2.7684e-27 J.

Hmm, 2.7684e-27 J. But none of the options match.

Looking back at the options:

Option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, that's exactly 2.555 times our calculated value.

Wait, 2.768e-27 * 2.555 is approximately 7.056e-27.

Hmm, 2.555 is approximately 2.56, which is 2.56, which is 16/6.25. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Compute 2.566e-38 * 8.988e9.

= (2.566 * 8.988) x 1e( -38 +9 )

= 23.07 x 1e-29 → 2.307e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.307e-28 *12 = 27.684e-28 → 2.7684e-27 J.

Wait, but option C is 7.056e-27. Hmm.

Wait, 7.056e-27 is about 2.55 times larger than 2.768e-27.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement said 12 charges are fixed, and the 13th is moving, but that's not the case. No, the 13th is fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem includes the potential energy from all pairs, including the pairs among the 12 charges.

So, the total potential energy is the sum of all pairs: the 12 pairs with the 13th charge, plus the C(12,2) pairs among the 12 charges.

So, the 12 charges each contribute U_i = k*(2e)^2/(2m) = 2 e² k/m.

So 12 * 2 e² k/(2m) → 12 e² k/m.

But m is 2, so 12 e² k/(2) = 6 e² k.

Wait, but that's only the 12-pairs part. The other part is the C(12,2) = 66 pairs among the 12 charges. Each pair has a distance between them. But without knowing their arrangement, it's impossible to compute the potential energy. But perhaps, for the sake of finding the minimum energy, the 12 charges are arranged such that they are as far apart as possible, so their mutual potential energy is as low as possible (since like charges repel, so maximum separation minimizes potential energy).

But without knowing the exact distances, perhaps the problem expects us to consider only the 12 pairs with the 13th charge, and not the pairs among the 12.

But in that case, the answer doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to compute the potential energy between all pairs, including the 12 charges among themselves, assuming they are all at the same distance from each other. For example, perhaps they're arranged in a regular icosahedron or something, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have only a single charge at 2m and the others elsewhere, but no, the problem says 12 are at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents in the calculation. Let me recompute 12 * (e² *k):

e = 1.602e-19 C.

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

k =8.988e9 N m²/C².

e² *k = 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.566 *8.988e-29 = 23.07e-29 → 2.307e-28 J.

Multiply by 12 → 27.68e-28 → 2.768e-27 J.

Yes, that's correct.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 7.056e-27.

Wait, let's see, 7.056e-27 is approximately 2.55 times larger than 2.768e-27.

Wait, 2.55 is about 12 * 0.2125. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 4 somewhere.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the potential energy when moving a charge from infinity to a point is U = k q Q / r.

In this case, Q is the 13th charge (2e), and q is each of the 12 charges (2e).

So each contributes U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2m) → 4 e² k/(2m) → 2 e² k/m.

With m=2, that becomes 2 e² k/(2) = e² k.

So each U_i is e² k.

12 of them: 12 e² k.

Compute 12 * 1.602e-19^2 *8.988e9.

Which is 12 * (2.566e-38) *8.988e9.

= 12 * (2.566e-38 *8.988e9) → 12 * 23.07e-29 → 276.84e-29 → 2.7684e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again.

Option C is 7.056e-27. Let's compute what would lead to that.

7.056e-27 = x * 12 * e² *k.

So x = (7.056e-27) / (12 * e² *k) ) → denominator as 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 12 * 23.07e-29 → 276.84e-29 → 2.7684e-27.

So 7.056e-27 / 2.7684e-27 ≈ 2.55.

So x=2.55.

What factor would lead to 2.55?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is U = (k) * (sum of all pairs) → so 12 pairs with the 13th, and C(12,2) pairs among the 12.

But without knowing the mutual distances, perhaps the problem expects to ignore them, but perhaps the answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 2.76e-27, which is not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27, but I'm not sure how that would come about.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the 13th charge is at the origin, and the 12 charges are arranged in a regular icosahedron around it, each at a distance of 2m. Then, the distance between two adjacent charges could be approximated, and their mutual potential energy calculated. But that's a more advanced calculation, and perhaps beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is (k * 2e * 2e) / (2m) ) → 4 e² k/(2m) → 2 e² k/m.

Then, the total is 12 * (2 e² k/m) → 24 e² k/m.

Wait, but m is 2, so 24 e² k/(2) = 12 e² k.

Which is 12 * (e² *k) → 12 * 2.307e-28 → 2.768e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but among the options, the closest is option C, 7.056e-27, which is about 2.55 times larger. But I can't see where I might have missed a factor of 2.55.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9.

Let me try that.

If k is 9e9, then:

12 * e² *k → 12 * (2.566e-38) *9e9.

=12 * (23.094e-29) → 277.128e-29 → 2.771e-27 J.

Still the same order of magnitude.

Wait, but 7.056e-27 is about 2.55 times larger, which is approximately 12 * 2.566e-38 * 9e9 * 2.55.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to compute the potential energy between all pairs, including the 12 charges with each other, assuming they are all at the same distance from each other.

But without knowing that distance, perhaps it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem made a mistake in the options.

But given that, perhaps the intended answer is option B, 2.822e-26, but that's an order of magnitude higher than our calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge.

Wait, the problem says each has charge 2e, but perhaps I misread that and it's e, not 2e.

Wait, no, the problem states each has charge 2e.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k q^2 ) / (2r) for each charge, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is calculated as the sum of all pairs, including the 13th charge.

Wait, another idea: perhaps each pair between the 12 and the 13th contributes U = k*(2e)^2/(2m), but perhaps the 13th charge is counted once, so 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which would be 12 * (4 e² k)/(2m) → 12 * 2 e² k/m → 24 e² k/m.

With m=2, that's 24 e² k/(2) →12 e² k.

Which is the same as before.

So, 12 e² k = 12 * 2.566e-38 *8.988e9 = 2.768e-27 J.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 because potential energy is counted for each pair. Wait, no, because each charge interacts with the 13th only once.

In any case, I've gone through multiple approaches, and the calculation consistently leads to approximately 2.77e-27 J, which is not among the options provided. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27, but I can't see how that arises from the calculation unless there's a mistake in the problem or in the options.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy of the system, which includes the interactions between the 13th charge (fixed at point P) and each of the 12 charges constrained at a distance of 2 meters from P. The potential energy between two charges is given by:

\[
U = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r}
\]

Here:
- \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) (Coulomb's constant),
- \( q_1 = q_2 = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \),
- \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Potential energy for one pair
For one pair (the 13th charge and one of the 12 charges):
\[
U_i = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{4e^2 k}{2} = 2e^2 k
\]

### Step 2: Total potential energy for all 12 pairs
Since there are 12 charges, the total potential energy is:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 12 \cdot U_i = 12 \cdot 2e^2 k = 24e^2 k
\]

### Step 3: Substituting values
Substitute \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) and \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \):
\[
e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2
\]
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9)
\]

First, calculate \( e^2 k \):
\[
e^2 k = (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) = 2.307 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J}
\]

Now, multiply by 24:
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 24 \cdot (2.307 \times 10^{-28}) = 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Comparing with the options
The calculated total potential energy is approximately \( 5.537 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \). Among the given options:
- **A)** \( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) is too large by two orders of magnitude.
- **B)** \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) is also too large by one order of magnitude.
- **C)** \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) is the closest, though slightly higher than the calculated value.
- **D)** \( 122.330 \, \text{J} \) is irrelevant and far too large.

The discrepancy between the calculated value and option C suggests either a minor rounding difference or an issue with the problem's options. However, based on the given choices, the best match is:

**Answer: C**
