Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on atomic physics, but I'll try to remember.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0⟩ state to the |1,0,0⟩ state via two dipole transitions. I think dipole transitions are those where a photon is emitted or absorbed, right? And the selection rules for hydrogen come into play here.

Wait, the selection rules for the hydrogen atom in the dipole approximation are that Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So for each transition, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0 or ±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So n=3, l=0. We need to go down to |1,0,0⟩, which is n=1, l=0. But since it's a dipole transition, each step must follow the selection rules.

Wait, how does the transition happen? Let's think: the hydrogen atom can't go from l=0 directly to l=0 because that would require Δl=0, which isn't allowed for dipole transitions. So it must go through an intermediate state. So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to a state with l=1 because Δl can only be ±1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So possible intermediate states are for n=2 or n=1, but wait, to get from n=3 to n=1 in two steps, each step must change n by some amount. Let me think: each dipole transition can change n by 1, because Δn = ±1 for each photon emission. Wait, no, wait. The selection rule for n is that Δn can be any integer except 0, but in practice, for emission, n decreases. So from n=3, the first transition could go to n=2 or n=1. But since we need two transitions, the first step from 3 to 2, then 2 to 1.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So for the first transition, l must go from 0 to 1, because l can only increase or decrease by 1. So the intermediate state must have l=1 and m=0, since the initial m is 0.

Wait, but when you change l from 0 to 1, what about m? The selection rule says m can change by 0, ±1. So the initial m is 0, so the next m could be -1, 0, or +1.

So the possible intermediate states after the first transition are |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩. Because the n can only decrease by 1 (since we're going from 3 to 2; going to 1 would require two steps, but dipole transitions are single-photon, so each step can only change n by 1 each time? Or wait, can n change by more in a single dipole transition? I think no, because for dipole transitions, the selection rule is Δn = ±1 only. Or wait, I'm not so sure. Wait no, let me think: the selection rule for hydrogen is that in dipole transitions, Δn can be any non-zero integer except for some cases (like the 1s → 2p transition which is allowed, but maybe others have more restrictions), but sometimes higher changes are possible, but in the standard non-relativistic treatment, I think Δn can be any except 0.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For hydrogen, the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. There's no strict rule that Δn must be ±1, but in practice, when considering that energy differences are quantized, bigger Δn would require higher energy photons, but that's not directly a selection rule. So the possible transitions for n would be from 3 to any n where l changes by ±1.

But since our initial l is 0, the next state must have l=1. So from |3,0,0⟩, the possible next states are |n,1,m⟩ where n can be 2 or 4, but wait, since the energy levels for hydrogen go as n^(-1), higher n is higher energy. But the initial state is n=3, which is lower than n=4, so I think emission would involve going to lower n. So from n=3, you can go to n=2 or n=4? Wait, but to reach n=1 eventually, you need to take two steps. Wait, but if you jump from n=3 to n=4, then you might not be able to get to n=1 in the next step. So perhaps n decreases by 1 each time.

Wait, no, the dipole transition allows Δn = ±1, but for emission, it's Δn = -1 (since the atom is losing energy, so n decreases). So the first transition from 3 must go to 2, because Δn = -1.

So the first step is 3→2. But wait, can n go to 4? No, because that would require absorption of a photon, but the question says that the state is decaying, so it's emission, so n decreases. So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, or +1.

So the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩.

Then, the second transition must bring it down to |1,0,0⟩. So from |2,1,m⟩, the next step must have Δl = -1 (since l is 1, and needs to go to 0). So the second state's l is 0. So the final state is |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but the second transition must go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. So the selection rules here are again Δl = -1, and Δm can be 0, ±1 (but since m in the final state is 0, and initial is m, the change must be m_final - m_initial = -m. Hmm, so:

In the first step, m can be -1, 0, +1.

In the second step, m must go from m to 0.

So the possible m changes in the second step are m → m + Δm, where Δm is 0, ±1.

Wait, let's think: The initial m in the intermediate state is m1. The final state has m=0.

So the change in m (Δm) must be 0 - m1, but Δm can only be -1, 0, +1.

So possible m1 must be such that 0 - m1 is ±1 or 0. So m1 can be 0, ±1.

So for the intermediate state |2,1,m⟩, m can be 0, 1, or -1.

Then, in the second transition:

If intermediate m is 0, then the final m must be 0 (since Δm can be 0). So the second transition is from 2,1
