Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking for the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system. 

Wait, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, right? And their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c. Both are moving in the positive x-direction. So, I need to figure out two things: the relative speed as seen from one astronaut's frame, and the total energy of the system.

I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because of relativity. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. But wait, I think that formula gives the speed of one object as seen from the other's frame. Let me think about how that works.

So, the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. The formula I remember is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/(c²)), but that's when you're adding speeds. But here, both are moving in the same direction, so the relative speed should be the difference. So maybe it's (v2 - v1) or (v1 - v2) divided by the denominator.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this straight. If I have two frames, S and S'. S' is moving at speed u relative to S. An object in S has speed v, then in S' it's (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)). Right. So in this problem, each astronaut is in their own frame. Wait, no, the question is about the relative speed between the two. So let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, what speed is B moving at?

So in A's frame, B is moving at v = (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, that's ( -0.1c ) / (1 - (0.3c²)/c² ) = (-0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = (-0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately -0.1428c. But since speed is a magnitude, it's 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. So that would match option C or D, which both have relative speed 0.14c.

But wait, one of the options is 0.14c and the other is 0.14c as well. So maybe I should double-check. Oh wait, looking back, the options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that's one part done.

Now the energy part. The total energy of the system would be the sum of their relativistic energies. So each astronaut's energy is gamma times mc². But wait, their masses are 2m and 3m, so I need to compute gamma for each and multiply by their respective masses.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for astronaut A (2m, 0.6c):

Gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy_A = Gamma_A * 2m * c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B (3m, 0.5c):

Gamma_B = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy_B = Gamma_B * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So about 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D says E=5 mc² but same speed. So our calculation gives E≈5.96, so option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Is the energy in the center-of-momentum frame or the lab frame? The question says "the total energy of the system." In relativity, total energy is the sum of each individual's energy as measured in the same frame.

But wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." Oh, I think it's considering each astronaut's energy in their rest frame, but no, wait, no—it's probably the sum from the same frame. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the frame. I think the question is considering the energy as measured from the lab frame, which is the frame where the two astronauts are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively.

Wait, can't the total energy be calculated just by adding their energies as per the lab frame? Because each is moving, their energies are their relativistic energies, so the sum should be correct.

So adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives around 5.964, which rounds to 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C, which has v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait, let me re-verify the relative speed. Because sometimes I get confused about which frame we're calculating. Oh, the relative speed is from one astronaut to the other. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and B is moving at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving at v= (0.5 - 0.6)/(1 - (0.5*0.6)/1) c. Wait, let's compute that denominator: 1 - (0.5*0.6) = 1 - 0.3=0.7. So numerator is 0.5-0.6= -0.1. So v= (-0.1)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. So speed is 0.1428c. Rounded to two decimal places, 0.14c. So that's correct.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is about 5.96 mc², so option C is correct.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(2m\)) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\) (for the astronaut with mass \(3m\)). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} = -0.1428c
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction, but the speed is the magnitude, so:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c
\]

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### Energy of the first astronaut (\(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### Energy of the second astronaut (\(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(E = 5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\)**
