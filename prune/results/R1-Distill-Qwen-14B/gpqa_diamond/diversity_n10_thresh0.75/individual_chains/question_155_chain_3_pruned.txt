Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the variance formula: ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩ for the given state.

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x. So if it's an eigenstate of P_x, then the expectation value of P_x would just be the eigenvalue. But for P_z, since it's a different operator, I can't say the same. So I need to calculate the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state.

First, let's get the state vector. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So it's a three-component vector. Let me write that as |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

The operator P_z is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that out:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ ℏ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, -ℏ ]

Wait, no, the first row is [ℏ, 0, 0], second [0,0,0], third [0,0,-ℏ]. Yeah, I think that's correct.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ is ψ† (P_z)^2 ψ.

Let me compute ⟨P_z⟩ first.

So the state vector is a column vector. I'll transpose it to get the row vector for the bra, so the conjugate transpose. But wait, the components are real, right? Because the state is given as real numbers. So the bra vector is just [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/
