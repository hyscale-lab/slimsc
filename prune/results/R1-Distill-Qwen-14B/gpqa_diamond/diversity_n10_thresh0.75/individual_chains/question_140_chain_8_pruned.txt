Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B has a melting point near 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B must be a solid at room temperature but melts just above that.

Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So I'm thinking X could be something like a strong base or a reagent that's commonly used.

The question asks about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. "Cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X," and if there are multiple instances, sum all their heavier and lighter isotopes. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to find the lightest and heaviest elements in X and add their atomic masses together.

Let me try to piece together what's going on here. The reaction of X with Y gives a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. So maybe it's a double displacement reaction where X and Y form some compound that precipitates, then when heated, it breaks down into B.

The gas W has equal protons and neutrons. Let's see: in a molecule, the number of protons is the sum of protons in each atom. For the molecule to have the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's a diatomic molecule. Let's think about possible gases. CO2 maybe? Wait, CO2 would have 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. But wait, the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule. Let's think: the molecule's total protons should equal total neutrons.

For example, H2O: H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So H2O has 2 protons and 8 + (each H has 0 neutrons) so 8. Wait, that's 2 protons and 8 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm. Maybe it's another gas.

Wait, what about a molecule like CH4? But CH4 has C (6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's the most common isotope), and 4 H (each with 1 proton, 0 neutrons). So total protons would be 6 +4=10, and neutrons 6. Not equal. Hmm. Maybe another approach.

Wait, wait, the gas is formed when X reacts with Y. Let me think about what kind of reaction this might be. If X is something like Na metal, and Y is water, then the reaction could produce H2 gas. But wait, H2 has 1 proton each, so total 2 protons, and 0 neutrons. That doesn't work because 2â‰ 0.

Alternatively, if Y is an acid, maybe X is a metal reacting to release CO2 or H2 gas. Let's think: if X is sodium metal and Y is an acid
