Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again: "In a specific region of the sky, astronomers have observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" The options are A to D, with some power laws.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax plx is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So if the distance r is in parsecs, then plx = 1/r. Right, because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and 1 parsec is the distance where the parallax is 1 arcsecond.

The question says the number of stars varies with 1/(plx^5). So if we write that out, number of stars N = k / (plx^5), where k is some constant.

But since plx = 1/r, substituting gives N = k / ( (1/r)^5 ) = k * r^5. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 1/( (1/r)^5 ) is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. That would mean that as distance increases, the number of stars increases with r^5. But wait, wait a second. That doesn't make sense if we're talking about the number of stars per unit distance.

Wait, wait. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So like, the number density as a function of r.

Wait, so maybe N is the number of stars in a volume element, and the volume depends on r somehow. Or perhaps the number is varying as a function of distance bin, and we're looking at the number per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential. So, if the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then N is proportional to r^5. But that would mean that for each increment in r, the number increases by r^5. So the number is increasing rapidly with distance. But that seems counterintuitive because I thought that as you look further away, the number of stars in a given volume would decrease because they are
