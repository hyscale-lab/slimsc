Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory, right? It's used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these.

First, what's the deal with Poincare symmetry? I think Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Oh wait, the SMEFT is a field theory, so it should respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model, right? The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry because it's built on special relativity. So if SMEFT is an effective theory, it should also respect Poincare. But wait, are all operators required to respect it? I think that operators are constructed in such a way that they maintain the symmetries of the underlying theory, which includes Poincare. So Poincare (option 2) is a must.

Next, Lorentz symmetry (option 1). Well, since Poincare includes Lorentz, if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But wait, maybe the question is considering them separately. SMEFT operators are classified by their Lorentz indices, so Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. So both 1 and 2 are required?

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes Lorentz, so if an operator already respects Poincare, it doesn't need to separately respect Lorentz? Or are they considered together? Probably, in the context of the question, the options are separate. So if an operator must respect Poincare, it must automatically respect Lorentz. But the question asks which must be respected by all operators. So 1 and 2 are both correct. But wait, the options are given as 1,2 etc. so let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A is 1 and 2, option C is 1,2,4. Oh, so if both 1 and 2 are correct, then the options that include both would be A or C. But I thought that Poincare includes Lorentz, so if operators are respecting Poincare, they're already respecting Lorentz. But the question asks which symmetries must be respected, so maybe both are considered?

Wait, sometimes in physics, when we talk about symmetries, Poincare is the broader symmetry group that includes Lorentz and translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected, Poincare is the higher group. So maybe only Poincare is required, but the question includes Lorentz as an option. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the SMEFT operators are constructed respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model, which include both Lorentz and Poincare. Wait, but Poincare includes translations, which are in the SM, but SMEFT is a field theory, so it's built on a spacetime with translations. So do all operators in SMEFT respect both Lorentz and Poincare? Or is Poincare a subset or a superset?

Wait, another angle: What's the structure of the SMEFT Lagrangian? It's built from operators that are classified based on their Lorentz structure. So the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry—so 1 must be respected. Poincare includes translations, which are part of the symmetries as well. So operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare? Or is Poincare automatically satisfied because the theory is relativistic?

Hmm, I think that in effective field theories, you typically respect the symmetries of the underlying theory. The Standard Model respects both Lorentz and Poincare, so SMEFT should too. So operators are built to respect both. So which one is correct: 1,2 etc.

Wait, but in the SMEFT, operators are constructed with definite Lorentz indices, which implies that they respect Lorentz symmetry. And because the theory is a relativistic field theory, it must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So both 1 and 2 are required. So the options would include both. Looking back, option A is 1 and 2, option C includes 1,2, and 4.

But wait, the options are 1,2,3,4. The question is which must be respected by all operators. So what about the other symmetries, CP and CPT.

CP symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation and parity. Does SMEFT respect CP symmetry? The Standard Model is approximately CP symmetric (except for certain processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix). But in the SMEFT, operators can be CP-even or CP-odd. So the operators themselves don't necessarily have to be CP-symmetric. Because the SMEFT allows for including all possible operators, including those that violate CP. So for example, some dimension-6 operators can be CP-odd. So operators don't have to respect CP. So option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. So any Lorentz-invariant QFT must respect CPT symmetry. So SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect CPT. So option 4 must be respected.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so CPT must hold. So all operators must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

So let's recap: The operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, earlier I was confused about Poincare and Lorentz. Because Poincare includes Lorentz, so if operators respect Poincare, they already respect Lorentz. So the question is, which of the four must be respected by all operators.

So the symmetries that must be respected by all operators are 1,2,4. Because they’re part of the structure of the theory.

Wait, but the options don’t have all three. Let me look again. The options are:

A) 1,2

B)3,4

C)1,2,4

D)1,3,4

So option C is 1,2,4. So that would mean that all three are required. But wait, does SMEFT require Poincare symmetry? Or is Lorentz symmetry part of Poincare, and so if the operator respects Poincare, it's sufficient?

Alternatively, perhaps in this context, the question is considering Poincare and Lorentz as separate. But that's not correct, because Poincare includes Lorentz.

Wait, another approach: What is the Poincare group? It's the group of isometries of Minkowski spacetime, which includes Lorentz transformations and translations. So Poincare symmetry is more general than Lorentz.

So if all operators must respect Poincare symmetry, they automatically respect Lorentz. So when the question asks which must be respected, if 2 is correct, then 1 is automatically correct. So the correct options would include 2, but not have to include 1 separately.

But the options don't have such a choice. So perhaps the question is considering Lorentz and Poincare as separate. Which is incorrect, because Poincare includes Lorentz.

But perhaps the correct approach is that SMEFT must be a Poincare-invariant theory. Therefore, all operators must be Poincare-invariant, which implies Lorentz-invariant. So, in that case, 2 must be a symmetry, so 1 is automatically satisfied. So for the question, which of the following symmetries must be respected by all operators, 2 and 4 must be respected. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps all the operators in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant. So 2 is correct. Then, CPT is a separate symmetry. So 4 is correct. So that would mean 2 and 4 are correct. But looking at the options, none of the options have 2 and 4. The options are A)1,2; C)1,2,4; etc. Alternatively, perhaps Poincare and Lorentz are considered as separate in this question, but that's incorrect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each symmetry implies.

1. Lorentz Symmetry: Operators must transform appropriately under Lorentz transformations.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Operators must transform under Poincare (includes Lorentz and translations). So if an operator respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincare, which implies they must respect Lorentz.

But since the question asks which of the following must be respected, and the options are 1 and 2, perhaps both are correct. But in reality, if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the operators must be constructed in such a way that they are Poincare-invariant. But perhaps the question considers Lorentz and Poincare as separate. So the correct answer would include both.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct symmetries are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So option C (1,2,4) would be correct.

Wait, but I thought that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, which option 1 is correct, then CPT must also hold. So 4 is correct.

So the answer would include 1,2,4.

Which is option C.

But let me think again. Does the SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? I think the SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant theory because it's a field theory on Minkowski space. So yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is correct. Which implies 1 is correct because Poincare includes Lorentz. So 1 and 2 are both correct. Then, the question also includes CPT symmetry (4). So the correct answer is 1,2, and 4, which is option C.

But wait, Poincare includes Lorentz, so why are both 1 and 2 correct? Because the options are given separately, perhaps in the question, but in reality, if 2 is correct, 1 is automatically correct. But the question is asking which of the following symmetries must be respected. So if the options included only 2, that would cover it, but in the choices, the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct symmetries are Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. So the answer is C.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The question asks which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT operators are constructed with definite Lorentz indices, meaning they must respect Lorentz symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental requirement for relativistic field theories.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is a relativistic field theory on Minkowski spacetime, it must respect Poincaré symmetry. This implies that operators in SMEFT are automatically Poincaré-invariant, and thus Lorentz-invariant as well.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). However, SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP symmetry, such as dimension-6 operators that are CP-odd. Therefore, CP symmetry is not a requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of all Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). While Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry, the question considers them as separate options. Therefore, the correct answer is the combination of 1, 2, and 4.

Answer: C
