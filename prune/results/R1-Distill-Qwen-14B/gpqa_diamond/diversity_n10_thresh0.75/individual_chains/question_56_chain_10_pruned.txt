Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me start by thinking through what I know.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, what are the selection rules for dipole transitions in the hydrogen atom? I think it's something like Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. So for a dipole transition, the angular momentum quantum number l can change by ±1, and m can change by 0 or ±1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. Let's break it down. The n is 3, l is 0 (s orbital), and m is 0. We need it to transition to |1,0,0⟩, which is n=1, l=0, m=0.

But since it's a two-step process, each step must follow the selection rules. So from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state, then to n=1, l=0.

Wait, but wait. If the initial state is l=0, the first transition must change l by ±1. So possible l for the intermediate state could be l=1, since 0 +1 =1. So the first transition must go from l=0 (n=3) to l=1 (n=2 or maybe n=4? But n=4 is higher, so maybe n=2 is more likely since we're going lower in energy). So the first step is 3,0,0 → 2,1, m'?

Wait, but the initial m is 0, so the next m can be 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m for the intermediate state after first transition would be m=0, +1, or -1.

Then, from the intermediate state (n, l=1, m), we need to transition to |1,0,0⟩, which is l=0, m=0. Again, the selection rule applies. So for the second transition, l must go from 1 to 0,
