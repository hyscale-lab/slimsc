Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it carefully.

So the question is about a star similar to the Sun, with a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. When only one hemisphere is spotty, the photometric observations show brightness variations because of rotationâ€”this looks like an exoplanet transit. The question is, what radius would a planet need to have to produce the same brightness variation as the spots do?

Hmm. I remember that the brightness variation from a planet transit is when the planet blocks some of the star's light. The change in brightness depends on the area of the planet compared to the star. But here, the spots are causing a variation because when they rotate into and out of view, the total brightness changes.

Wait, but the spots are cooler, so when they're on the facing side (as the star rotates), the observed brightness would decrease because those spots are emitting less light. So the star's brightness goes down when spots are visible and up when they aren't. But the question is about comparing this to an exoplanet transit, which blocks light, causing a dip in brightness.

Wait no, the planet blocks the light, so when it transits, the observed flux drops. The spot scenario also causes a dip in flux because the spots are darker. So we need to compare the two dip amplitudes.

The problem states that the observed brightness variation from the spots is the same as the planet's transit. So we need to find the planet's radius relative to the star such that the dip in brightness is the same as from the spots.

So first, let me model the brightness variation from the spots.

The star has a radius Rstar = R_sun. Let's compute the total decrease in flux when the spots are on view.

The star emits a certain flux based on its effective temperature. The spots are cooler, so each spot emits less flux. The total flux from the star when spots are visible will be the normal flux minus the flux from the spots.

Wait, I think I should calculate the fractional change in brightness when the spots are present.

The star's total flux without spots is F0. The spots have a lower flux. Let's see.
