Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let me read it carefully.

Alright, the question is about a star similar to the Sun, but one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, and the star's effective temperature is 6000K. The spots are 1000K cooler. When we observe this star, the brightness variations because of the spots rotating into and out of view can mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking what the radius of a planet would need to be to produce the same brightness variation as these spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted otherwise.

Hmm, I remember that the brightness dip when a planet transits a star depends on the area blocked. The formula for the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) when a planet transits is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots that cause a brightness variation. So I need to calculate the equivalent ΔF from the spots and then find R_planet such that (R_p / R_star)^2 equals that ΔF.

First, let's figure out the photometric variation caused by the spots. The star's total brightness is affected when spots come into view. The spots are cooler, so when they face us, the star's brightness decreases.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star is R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, so one hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So the spot coverage is 20% of that, which is 10% of the entire star's surface. Because 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, right?

But wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So if the star's surface area is 4πR², then each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². So the total spotted area is 0.4πR².

The star's total area is 4πR². So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.4πR² / 4πR² = 0.1, or 10% of the surface area.

Now each spot is at a temperature of 5000K, since the star is 6000K and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the flux from a spot is lower.

The star's total flux without spots is F0. When the spots are in view, the flux from those areas is F_spot = (T_spot / T_star)^2 * F0, because flux is proportional to T^4 per unit area, so the ratio is (5000/6000)^4.

So the total flux when spots are visible would be F_total = (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot, where f is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, which is 0.1.

Wait, f is 0.1. So F_total = 0.9 * F0 + 0.1 * F_spot.

The fractional change in flux ΔF is (F_total - F0) / F0.

So ΔF = [0.9F0 + 0.1*(5000/6000)^4 F0 - F0 ] / F0

Simplify that: [ -0.1 F0 + 0.1*(5000/6000)^4 F0 ] / F0

Which is -0.1 + 0.1*(5000/6000)^4.

Let me compute (5000/6000)^4. 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. 0.8333^4 is about:

Let me calculate step by step.

0.8333^2 = approx 0.6944.

0.6944^2 = ~0.4823.

So (5000/6000)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So ΔF = -0.1 + 0.1 * 0.4823 = -0.1 + 0.04823 = -0.05177.

So the fractional change is about -5.177%. But wait, when the spots are facing us, the flux is lower, so the dip is about 5.177% of the star's brightness.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so as the spots come into view, the brightness decreases, and when they go away, it increases. So the maximum dip is about this 5.177%.

But the problem states that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So when a planet transits, it blocks some light, causing a dip. The amplitude is (R_p / R_star)^2, which for the planet would be (Rp/Rstar)^2.

We need to find Rp such that (Rp/Rstar)^2 equals the fractional change we calculated, but wait, the fractional change is negative. So the amplitude is the absolute value, which is about 5.177% or 0.05177.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.05177 → Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, that's about 0.23. But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~0.32, option A is ~0.39, C is ~0.11. Hmm, none of the options are about 0.23. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the fractional change calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the spot area is 0.1 of the star's surface. Each spot emits at (5000/6000)^4 the flux of the star's normal surface. So the total flux when spots are present is 0.9 * F0 + 0.1 * (5000/6000)^4 F0.

So the fractional change is (0.9 + 0.1*(5000/6000)^4 - 1) = -0.1 + 0.1*(5000/6000)^4.

Wait, that's correct. So the dip is 5.177% as before.

Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Because when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then leave. So the maximum dip is when the maximum area of spots is visible. Wait no, in this case, one hemisphere is covered 20%, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the entire 20% is visible. But wait, the star is a sphere, so when it's viewed edge-on, one hemisphere is in view. Wait no, for a star viewed edge-on, we see half the surface (like a circle in 2D, the cross-section is a hemisphere). So when a star is rotating, the spots can rotate into and out of view. But in this problem, the star is such that one hemisphere is completely spotty. So when the spotty hemisphere faces us, the entire 20% of that hemisphere (which is
