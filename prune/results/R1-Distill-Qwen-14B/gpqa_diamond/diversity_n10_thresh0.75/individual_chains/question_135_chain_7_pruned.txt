Okay, I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and figure it out step by step. So the question is about the decay modes of a boson X, given its mass and the interaction Lagrangian. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the possible decay products of a particle depend on its mass and the interactions it's involved in.

The problem states that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f f(y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation here. Oh, right, in the Lagrangian, the interaction terms tell us what particles can interact, which in turn affects what decay products are possible.

So the interaction seems to be between the boson X and some fermions. The term is something like λ f X ψ_f, where f is a fermion field and ψ_f is probably the same as f? Maybe it's just a typo or notation confusion. Perhaps it's meant to be λ ψ_f X ψ_f, which would make sense for a Yukawa coupling. Oh wait, Yukawa couplings typically have terms like g ψ ψ X, which would imply that the boson X couples to a fermion-antifermion pair.

So the boson X can decay into a pair of fermions. The possible decay channels are determined by the fermions it can couple to, and their masses. Since the mass of X is 6 GeV, the fermions it can decay into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Looking at the options, they list various fermion pairs. Let's list the possible fermions and their masses. The known fermions and their approximate masses are:

- Electron (e): negligible, ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV.

Wait, so for each fermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than or equal to X's mass (6 GeV). Also, since quarks can't exist freely (color confinement), but in decays, they form hadrons. However, in the Lagrangian given, it's the fermion fields interacting directly, so perhaps X can decay into quark-antiquark pairs, which would then hadronize. But for decay into quarks, the mass threshold is the sum of the quark masses, but in reality, the binding energy is much higher. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. When considering decay kinematics, the center-of-m
