Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, okay. I remember that in such a well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n. The formula given is E = (pi^2 hbar^2)/(2mL^2), which I think is the ground state energy when n=1. So each particle's energy would be E multiplied by n squared, right? So for each particle, the energy is E * n^2.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they're fermions. Oh right, fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Since they're identical, they have to have different quantum numbers or different spins.

Wait, but in a 1D well, the quantum state is determined by the principal quantum number n and the spin. Oh wait, spin is an additional degree of freedom. So each particle can have the same n, but different spin states as long as the spin is accounted for. Wait, no, wait. In 1D, the quantum numbers are just n and spin. But wait, in 1D, each energy level is non-degenerate except for spin. So for each n, there are two possible states because each particle is spin-1/2, which has two possible spin states: up and down.

But wait, in this problem, all the particles are spin-1/2, so each can be in a spin-up or spin-down state. But since we have four particles, how does that work?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The particles are spin-1/2, so each has two possible spin states. But when you have multiple particles, they can share the same spatial wavefunction as long as their spin states are different. Oh wait, but in the case of identical fermions, each fermion must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin. So if two fermions are in the same spatial state, they must have different spins. But wait, in 1D, the spatial part only has n as the quantum number, right?

So for each spatial energy level (each n), there are two possible spin states. So two fermions can occupy the same n, one spin-up and one spin-down. But if there are more than two particles, then they have to go to higher n's.

Wait, so let's think about four particles. Let's start from the ground state. The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration.

So the first two particles can go into n=1, each with opposite spins. The next two can go into n=2, each with opposite spins. Wait, but wait, no. Because for n=1, we can have two particles (each spin). Then the next two must go into the next available n, which is n=2. But with four particles, that would be n=1 and n=2, each holding two particles.

Wait, but wait, each n can hold two particles (because of spin up and down). So with four particles, you can have:

n=1: two particles (spin up and down)

n=2: two particles (spin up and down)

That's the ground state. So the total energy would be each particle's energy. So the first two have energy E*(1)^2 = E each, the next two have E*(2)^2 =4E each.

So total energy for the ground state is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E = 10E.

Wait, but that's for four particles. So 10E is the ground state.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me think about the first excited state. The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. Hmm. But wait, in the ground state, all the particles are filled up to n=2.

Wait, no. Wait, for four particles, each n can take two due to spin. So n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds 2. So the ground state is n=1 and n=2 filled.

Wait, if that's the case, the next state would be when one particle moves to n=3. Let me see. But wait, because in the ground state, all the lowest possible states are filled. So in the ground state, four particles are in n=1 (two) and n=2 (two).

Wait, but particles are fermions, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So each spatial orbital can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for four particles, we need to fill up the first two spatial orbitals (n=1 and n=2), each with two particles.

So the ground state is n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles).

Now, the first excited state would involve promoting one of the particles from the higher n level (n=2) to the next available n level, which is n=3. Hmm, but wait, how does that work? Because in the ground state, all lower orbitals are filled. So to get the first excited state, you have to promote the highest occupied state (n=2) to the next available (n=3), but you can't have more than two in any n. So the first excited state would have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3? No, wait, that can't be because each n can hold only two.

Wait, no, each n can hold two particles (spin up and down). So the ground state is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. The first excited state would have one particle promoted to n=3, but since n=3 can hold two, you can have one moved. But since all particles are in the same spin state, perhaps no.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the ground state is when the four particles are arranged in the lowest possible orbitals. So n=1 can hold two, n=2 can hold two, so four in total. So the ground state is when two are in n=1 and two in n=2. So their energies are E*(1)^2 = E for n=1, and E*(2)^2=4E for n=2. So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Then the first excited state would be when we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. So now, the configuration is: two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Wait, but n=2 can still hold another particle because it's spin. Oh wait, no, because n=2 already has two particles (spin up and down). So you can't put another in n=2. So in the first excited state, you have to promote one from n=2 to n=3. So now, n=3 has one particle, n=2 has one, and n=1 has two. Wait, but each n can have two, so n=2 can have two, but we have only two particles in n=1 and two in n=2 in the ground state. So when you promote one from n=2 to n=3, you'll have n=2 still holding two? No, because you've moved one. So n=2 would have one, and n=3 would have one. That's not correct because we have four particles. Let me recount.

Wait, the total is four particles. In the ground state, two in n=1, two in n=2.

In the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 electrons moves to n=3, but since n=3 can take two, but you can only move one. So now, the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So how does that work?

Wait, no, because each n can have up to two particles. So if you have two in n=2, moving one to n=3 would leave one in n=2, but n=3 can accept two. So you can actually have two in n=3 (with opposite spins), but wait, in the ground state, n=3 is empty. So to get the first excited state, perhaps you don't move a single particle, but consider the next possible configuration.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when you have two in n=1, and two in n=3. Because the next available after n=2 is n=3. So in the first excited state, the two in n=3? No, wait, that would be a higher energy than having two in n=2.

Wait, but let me think about the possible energy levels.

The energy of each particle is E n^2. So for n=1, E; n=2, 4E; n=3, 9E, etc.

So the ground state is the lowest possible arrangement of four particles, which is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2.

So the total energy is 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E.

Then the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. For four particles, the next would be when one particle is promoted to n=3. But since each n can take two, perhaps the first excited state is when you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. But then, how many particles in each?

Wait, but each n can have two. So perhaps the first excited state is when you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. So the total energy would be 2*E + 1*(4E) + 1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, that's the first excited state. Then the second excited state would be the next possible arrangement. What's the next?

Well, perhaps moving another particle from n=2 to n=3. Then, you have two in n=1, zero in n=2, and two in n=3. So the total energy would be 2E + 2*(9E) = 2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but wait, is that the next possible state? Or could the arrangement where you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3, which is 15E, and the next state is when you have two in n=2 and two in n=3, giving a total of 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) = 8E +18E=26E.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The first excited state would be the next possible lowest energy. The ground state is 10E. The next possible would be when you have one particle in n=3 and the others in lower n.

Wait, maybe another approach. The ground state is filled up to n=2 with two particles each. The first excited state would have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. The second excited state would have two in n=1, two in n=3.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the ordering is different. Let me think about the possible energies:

If all four particles are in the lowest possible orbitals, the next possible higher energy state would be when one is promoted to the next orbital.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the possible states.

Four identical fermions in a 1D infinite well with spin-1/2.

Each spatial state can have two fermions (spin-up and spin-down).

So the ground state is:

n=1: 2 particles

n=2: 2 particles

Total energy: 2*1^2 E + 2*2^2 E = 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: promote one of the n=2 particles to n=3.

So n=1:2, n=2:1, n=3:1.

But wait, each n can have up to two, so n=2 still has one spot, but n=3 has one spot. But wait, the total number of particles is four. So n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Wait, but then the next state would be to have n=2 filled again, but with one in n=3. So perhaps the second excited state is when you have two in n=2 and two in n=3.

So total energy would be 2*(4E) + 2*(9E) =8E +18E=26E.

But let me check the options.

The options are:

A) 30E, 39E, 50E

B)4E, 10E,50E

C)4E, 10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E.

Wait, our ground state is 10E, first excited 15E, second excited 26E. But that's not matching any options. So maybe I messed up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me rethink the arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible n's, but considering that each n can hold two.

Wait, for four particles, with each n holding two, that's n=1 and n=2, holding two each. So total energy is 10E.

The first excited state could be when you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Total energy 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would be when two are in n=1, two in n=3. So the energy is 2E +2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

Wait, but 20E isn't in the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when the highest occupied level is higher. Let me think about the possible order.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two are in n=1, and two are in n=3. So their energies would be 1E each for n=1, and 9E each for n=3. So the total is 2E + 2*9E=2E +18E=20E. But 20E isn't in any options.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but in that case, the total energy would be 2E + 4E +9E =15E. Then the second excited state would be when another is promoted to n=3, so two in n=3 and two in n=1, making 20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm missing some other arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the particles are arranged in a way that the highest n is as low as possible. Let me think again.

Another approach: the possible energy levels are (n^2) E for each particle. Since the particles are fermions, we have to fill the lowest possible energy levels with two particles each (due to spin) before moving to higher levels.

So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles (each E)

n=2: 2 particles (each 4E)

Total energy: 2E +8E=10E (ground state).

First excited state: promote one particle from n=2 to n=3.

So now, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 1, n=3 has 1.

Total energy: 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: promote another from n=2 to n=3.

But wait, n=2 can't have more than two. But if we promoted another, we would have n=2:0, n=3:2.

So total energy: 2E + 0*(4E) +2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none have 20E. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Where 18E comes from 2*(3^2)E=18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two are in n=3, but that's only two particles. So maybe the first excited state is when two are in n=3, but that would require that n=2 has two and n=3 has two, which is four particles.

Wait, no, because n=1 can only hold two. So perhaps the first excited state is when n=1 has two, n=3 has two. So the energy would be 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when we have n=2 filled and n=3 has two. But that would be n=2 has two, n=3 has two. That's four particles. So the total energy is 2*(4E) +2*(9E)=8E +18E=26E. Still not matching any options.

This is confusing. Maybe I should think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, option B is 4E,10E,50E. That seems too high.

Option C is 4E,10E,15E.

Option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Option A is 30E, 39E,50E.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the ground state. Maybe the ground state is when all four are in the same n. But no, because each n can only hold two particles.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the particles are in the same n but different spins. But for four particles, you can't do that because each n can hold only two (spin up and down). So the ground state must have n=1 and n=2 filled.

So ground state is 10E.

Then the first excited state is when one particle moves up to n=3, so two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. So the total energy is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Then the second excited state would be when another particle moves to n=3, making it two in n=3, and none in n=2. So total energy is 2E +2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D has 10E,15E,18E.

Wait, 18E would be the case where two particles are in n=3. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E. So the three states would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), and 18E (second excited). That matches option D.

But wait, how can the second excited state be 18E when the first excited is 15E?

Ah, perhaps the first excited state is when you have one particle in n=3, but the total energy is 15E, and the second excited state is when two are in n=3, with 20E. But the options don't have 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, but the total energy is 15E, and the second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=4, making the energy 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. But that's even higher and doesn't match the options.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating the first excited state.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't just promoting one particle but a different arrangement.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when the four particles are arranged as n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3. No, that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when all four are in n=2, but that's impossible because n=2 can hold only two particles. So you can't have four in n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when you have two in n=2 and two in n=3. So the energy is 2*(4E) +2*(9E)=8E+18E=26E.

But that's still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is when all four are in n=1. But that's impossible because each n can hold only two particles. So for four particles, you need at least n=1 (two) and n=2 (two). So ground state is 10E.

Given that, and the options, I'm stuck.

Wait, let's think about the problem statement again. The question says to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state.

So the ground state is 10E, as we have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

The first excited state is when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So the energies are 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would then be when another particle moves to n=3, making it two in n=3 and none in n=2. So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E)=2E+18E=20E.

But none of the options have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two are in n=3 (20E), but that's not an option.

Looking back at the options, option D is 10E, 15E, 18E.

Wait, 18E is 2*9E. So perhaps for the second excited state, two particles are promoted to n=3, but that would require four particles, so n=3 has two and n=2 has two. No, wait, that would require four, but n=1 can only take two.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1. So the total energy is 2E + 2*9E = 2E + 18E=20E.

But again, not matching the options.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a different approach. Let me think about the possible energy levels in terms of the sum of n^2 for each particle.

The four particles must have unique quantum states. So the ground state would have the four lowest possible n values, each with two particles in the same n but opposite spins.

Wait, no. Because each n can have two particles, so the four lowest n are n=1 (two), n=2 (two). So the ground state is 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3. So the sum is 2*(1^2) + 1*(2^2) +1*(3^2) = 2 +4 +9=15E.

The second excited state would be when another n=2 particle moves to n=3, making n=2 have zero and n=3 have two. So the sum is 2*(1^2) + 2*(3^2) =2 + 18=20E.

But again, that's not in the options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, making n=1:2, n=3:2. So the energy is 2E + 2*(9E) =2E +18E=20E.

But that would be the second excited state.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So the energy would be 2*(4E) +2*(9E) = 8E +18E=26E.

But that's higher than 15E, so it can't be the first excited state.

This is getting quite confusing. Let me try to list the possible energies in order.

The possible energy levels for four particles would be:

Ground state: 2*(1^2) + 2*(2^2) =2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: 2*(1^2) +1*(2^2) +1*(3^2)=2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: 2*(1^2) +2*(3^2)=2E +18E=20E.

But looking at the options, none have 20E. So perhaps the second excited state is when one of the n=1 particles moves up, but that would require higher energy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=1, giving a total of 2E + 18E=20E. But that would be higher than the first excited state we thought earlier (15E). So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would be even higher.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is not considering the spin when counting the quantum numbers, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, another angle: the ground state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible energy levels, which is n=1 and n=2, each with two particles. So that's 10E.

The first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the configuration n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So energy 15E.

The second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=3, making n=1 (2), n=3 (2), so energy 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the given options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when the two particles in n=2 are promoted to n=3, making four particles in n=1 and n=3. So:

n=1: 2 particles, n=3:2 particles.

Energy: 2E + 2*(9E)=2E +18E=20E.

But that's higher than 15E, so it's actually the second excited state.

So the three states would be:

Ground:10E

First excited:15E

Second excited:20E.

But the options don't have 20E. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking again at the options:

Option D is 10E,15E,18E.

Wait, 18E is 2*(3^2 E)=18E. So perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and the other two are in n=2. But wait, that would require n=2 has two, but in that case, the configuration is:

n=1:2, n=2:2, n=3:0. No, that's the ground state.

Wait, no. Maybe the second excited state is when two are in n=3 and the other two are in n=2.

Wait, but that's not possible because n=2 can hold two, and n=3 can hold two. So four particles would be n=2:2, n=3:2. So the total energy is 2*(4E) + 2*(9E)=8E +18E=26E.

But that's higher than 20E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. But that's even higher.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. Maybe the problem is considering the spin as part of the quantum state, but in 1D, the quantum numbers are just n.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible options.

Option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the ground state is 10E, which we agree with.

The first excited state is 15E, which is 2E +4E +9E.

The second excited state is 18E, which is 2*(3^2 E)=18E.

But how does that fit?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=1, making the energy 2E + 18E=20E, but that's not 18E.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has three particles in n=3 and one in n=1. But that can't be because each n can hold only two.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and two in n=2. So the energy is 2*(4E) +2*(9E)=8E+18E=26E.

But that's not matching option D.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of the possible energies and their order.

The possible energy sums in order:

10E (ground)

15E (first excited)

20E (second excited)

26E (next)

But the options don't have 20E or 26E.

Looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E.

So the second excited state is 18E. How can that be?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and the other two are in n=2. But that would require four particles, which is the case. So n=2:2, n=3:2. So energy is 8E +18E=26E.

But that's not 18E.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and another in n=4.

So the energy would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=3 and one in n=4, but that would require more than four particles, which isn't the case.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the energy as the sum of the individual energies, but perhaps the first excited state is when the particles are in the configuration n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3, which gives total energy 2E + 4E +4E +9E=19E. But that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration for the second excited state is n=1 (two), n=3 (two), which gives 2E + 18E=20E.

But the options don't include that.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the sum of the squares of the first few n's, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, maybe the first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=3, making the sum 2E +9E +9E=20E.

But again, no option.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3, giving 8E +18E=26E.

But that's higher than 15E.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when two particles are in n=3, but that would require the configuration n=1:2, n=3:2, which is 2E +18E=20E.

So then the order would be:

Ground:10E

First excited:20E

Second excited:26E.

But that doesn't match any options.

This is getting frustrating. Perhaps I should look for another perspective.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each particle's energy is E n^2, but the system's energy is the sum of all particles' energies.

In the ground state, two in n=1, two in n=2: sum 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: one in n=3, so sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Second excited state: two in n=3, so sum 2E +18E=20E.

But the options don't have 20E.

Wait, the options have D)10,15,18.

So perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=3 and one in n=1. But that's impossible, as each n can hold two.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the particles are in the configuration n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4.

So the sum would be E +4E +9E +16E=30E.

Which is option A's ground state. But that's higher than the ground state, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps the particles are being arranged in a way that the first excited state is when you have n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3. So sum 1+4+4+9=18E. But that's higher than 15E.

Wait, but the first excited state is when two particles are in n=2 and two in n=3. So the sum would be 2*(4E) +2*(9E)=8E +18E=26E.

But that's higher than 15E.

I'm clearly not seeing something here. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

In the options, option D has 10,15,18.

So perhaps the second excited state is when two are in n=3, but that would be 18E. But wait, that would require two in n=3, but then where are the other two? They would be in n=1.

So the sum is 2E +18E=20E.

But 20 isn't 18. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, but the other two are in n=1 and n=2. Wait, but n=2 can hold two, so why would two be in n=3?

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state has one particle in n=3 and one in n=4.

So the sum would be 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so sum 2E +4E +9E +16E=31E.

No, that's not in the options.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the options, the correct sequence would be 10E,15E,18E, which is option D. So probably, the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, but I'm not sure how that adds up to 18E.

Wait, if two particles are in n=3, their energy is 2*9E=18E. But where are the other two? They must be in n=1, which is 2E. So total is 20E. But that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the sum of the squares of the first three n's, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the sum of the squares of the n's, but only for three of the particles. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, but another two are in higher levels. But I'm not making progress.

Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option D, as it's the only one that starts with 10E and 15E, which I calculated for the ground and first excited states.


In a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels for a particle are given by \( E_n = n^2 E \), where \( E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \). For four identical spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle requires that no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Each spatial quantum number \( n \) can hold two particles due to the two possible spin states (up and down).

### Ground State:
The lowest energy configuration is achieved by filling the lowest available energy levels. The first two particles occupy \( n=1 \) (one spin-up and one spin-down), and the next two occupy \( n=2 \) (one spin-up and one spin-down). The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2(1^2E) + 2(2^2E) = 2E + 8E = 10E
\]

### First Excited State:
To reach the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- \( n=1 \): 2 particles
- \( n=2 \): 1 particle
- \( n=3 \): 1 particle

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 1(2^2E) + 1(3^2E) = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E
\]

### Second Excited State:
In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n=2 \) to \( n=3 \). The configuration becomes:
- \( n=1 \): 2 particles
- \( n=2 \): 0 particles
- \( n=3 \): 2 particles

The total energy is:
\[
E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + 2E_3 = 2(1^2E) + 2(3^2E) = 2E + 18E = 20E
\]

However, the options provided do not include \( 20E \). Among the given options, the sequence \( 10E, 15E, 18E \) (option D) aligns with the calculated ground and first excited states, and \( 18E \) could correspond to a different interpretation of the second excited state. Based on the options, the most consistent answer is:

**Answer: D**
