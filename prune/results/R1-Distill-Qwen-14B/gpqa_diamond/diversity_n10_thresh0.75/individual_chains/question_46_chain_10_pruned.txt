Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit shaky on my organometallic reactions, but let's try to work through it. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Oh right, metathesis breaks and reforms carbon-carbon double bonds. 

So, the compound is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentene has five carbons. Let me count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, wait, no. 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the formula would be CH2=CH-C-CH2-CH3, but wait, no, the substituents. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, that can't be because that would be four carbons after the first double bond. Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, let me write it correctly.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be at carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Oh wait, wait, no. Pentane is five carbons. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, that can't be. I'm getting confused. Let me count again.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would be six carbons. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and
