Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's see if I can figure it out. The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. Let me break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me a reaction scheme with compounds A to E. Each step involves some kind of reaction, so I need to track what each compound looks like based on the reactions.

First, the steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Then, there are some hints provided and the options to choose from. Let's take it one step at a time.

Starting with compound A. The first reaction is with HCN, which is hydrogen cyanide. I remember that HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So, if A reacts with HCN, it probably has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. So A is likely a cyclic ketone because the products later on seem to involve rings.

Wait, the IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1. That's a strong indication of a carbonyl group, as ketones have peaks around there. So A is a cyclic ketone.

Then, A reacts with HCN to form B. The reaction of a cyclic ketone with HCN would typically form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyclo compound with a cyanohydrin structure. So, for example, if A is cyclopentanone, B would be cyclopentane cyanohydrin, which is a geminal diol with a nitrile group.

Next, compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd. That's hydrogenation. Since B is a cyanohydrin (so it has an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon), reducing it would probably reduce the nitrile group. Nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would become amines. Wait, no, more accurately, nitriles (RCN) upon hydrogenation (like H2 and palladium) become primary amines (RCH2NH2), but wait, no. Wait, nitriles when hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst (like Raney Ni or PtO2) typically convert to amines. So for example, R-C≡N → R-CH2-NH2. But wait, wait, when using H2 and Pd, perhaps it's a different condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalytic hydrogenation that stops at the imine stage, but no, I think for nitriles, hydrogenation leads to amines. Or wait, sometimes it's partial hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted to a methylene group. Wait, no, that's for different conditions, like with LiAlH4. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reduction is of the cyanohydrin. So the cyanohydrin has two groups on the same carbon: an -OH and a -CN. Upon hydrogenation, perhaps both the -OH and -CN are reduced. But wait, the -OH is an alcohol; under hydrogenation with H2 and Pd, would that affect it? I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile group is being hydrogenated. So the nitrile (RCN) would become RCH2NH2. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. When HCN adds to a ketone, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is a vicinal diol? No, wait, no. Wait, no, the cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone (R2C=O) reacts with HCN to form R2C(OH)CN. So the same carbon has an OH and CN group.

So in compound B, we have a structure like R2C(OH)CN. Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group is reduced. Let me think about what happens when a nitrile is hydrogenated. I think with H2 and Pd, it's usually catalytic hydrogenation, which would reduce the nitrile to an amine. So R-CH2-NH2. Alternatively, sometimes the conditions can vary, but perhaps in this case, the nitrile is reduced to a methylene group. Wait, no, that's under different conditions, like using LiAlH4 perhaps, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to an amine, so the product would have an amine group.

Wait, but then compound C would have an amine. But looking at the next step, compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form D. So if C has an amine group, reacting with nitrous acid (HNO2) might lead to a diazotization reaction, but that's typically with aromatic amines. Alternatively, if C has a primary amine, nitrous acid could convert it to an N-nitroso compound or perhaps form a diazonium salt which then undergoes elimination.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again. So compound B is a cyanohydrin, so structure is R2C(OH)CN. Then, when hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group (CN) is reduced to CH2NH2. So the structure becomes R2C(OH)CH2NH2. But then, when that's treated with HNO2, perhaps the NH2 group reacts. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation doesn't reduce the nitrile but something else. Alternatively, maybe the hydroxyl group is reduced as well. Wait, but hydroxyl groups (alcohol) are generally not hydrogenated under H2 and Pd, unless under high pressure or specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation reduces the ketone group in A, but wait, that's not part of B. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the product after each step.

So, in the first step, A (a ketone) reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin (B). Structure of B would have a hydroxyl and a nitrile on adjacent carbons, but wait, no, the carbonyl carbon in the ketone becomes a carbon bearing both OH and CN groups. So for example, if A is cyclopentanone, B would be 3-hydroxycyanocyclopentane or something like that.

Then B is reduced. Let's consider what happens when a nitrile is hydrogenated. Let's say the nitrile group (R-CN) is reduced to R-CH2-NH2. So that would be a primary amine. So after hydrogenation, compound C would have a CH2NH2 group.

But then, compound C is treated with HNO2. Nitrous acid usually reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts, which can then undergo various reactions like substitution, especially in aromatic compounds. But if C is a cycloalkane with a primary amine, perhaps the diazonium salt would form, and then elimination could occur, releasing N2 and forming a double bond.

Wait, but in this case, after forming the diazonium salt, elimination of an inert gas (like N2) would result in the formation of a double bond. So compound D would have a double bond where the amine was. Then, when that's done, elimination of the inert gas (like N2) would form a double bond, making E.

But let me try to think of it step by step. So if A is a cyclic ketone, like say cyclopentanone, then B would be the cyanohydrin, so 3-hydroxycyano cyclopentane. Then, hydrogenation of B would reduce the nitrile group to an amine. So you get 3-amino-3-hydroxycyclopentane? Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyanohydrin has the structure where the OH and CN are on adjacent carbons, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think about the structure of each compound.

Let me think about the hints. Hint a) says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm. So A reacts with a ylide to form that. I remember that ylides are used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So if A is a ketone, reacting with a ylide would form an alkene.

Looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The substituents are on the cyclopentane ring. So the ylide must have contributed a propenyl group, perhaps. Wait, the propan-2-ylidene group is a substituent with a double bond, right? So the product has a cyc
