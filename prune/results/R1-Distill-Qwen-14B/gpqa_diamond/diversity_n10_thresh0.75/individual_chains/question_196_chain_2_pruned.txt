Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the maximum speed of the mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. 

Wait, what's different about relativistic oscillators compared to the classical ones? Oh right, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is just when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But with relativity, things get more complicated because as the speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a spring is (1/2)kA². So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv_max², setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) which is option C. But wait, this is the classical case, and the question is about the relativistic case, so option C isn't the answer here.

Relativistic effects come into play because the mass increases with velocity. The total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy, since the system's total energy is conserved.

So, the total energy E_total is mc² (rest energy) plus (1/2)kA² (the maximum potential energy when x = A). At the point of maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The kinetic energy K is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, no, when the oscillator is at maximum speed, the potential energy is zero (since x=0?), wait no, wait. Wait, no, no. Wait, when the oscillator is at x=0, potential energy is zero, but kinetic energy is maximum. Oh wait, no. Wait, the potential energy is maximum when the oscillator is at the extremes (x=A or x=-A), and the kinetic
