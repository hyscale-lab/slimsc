Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs. But their detection capabilities differ based on the brightness of the stars they can observe. The question gives me the thresholds: ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means it can see stars with apparent V mag <= 17. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so apparent V mag <=16. So, for a star to be detectable by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude that is <=16, because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is brighter than 16, then it's brighter than 17 as well, so only stars with V mag <=16 can be seen by both.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. Brighter in magnitude means lower numbers. So, for example, a V mag of 16 is brighter than 17. So, the limit for ESPRESSO is V <=17. Similarly, for HIRES, it's V <=16. So, the star's apparent magnitude must be <=16 for both to observe it. Because if a star is, say, V=15, it's within both's limits. But if it's V=17, ESPRESSO can see it but HIRES can't. Similarly, V=16.5: ESPRESSO can see it (since 16.5 <17?), wait no. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Wait, magnitude is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, "brighter than 17 mag" would be V mag less than 17. So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <=17. HIRES can observe V <=16. So, the star's apparent V magnitude needs to be <=16 to be detected by both.

So, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude of each star and see which ones are <=16.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance is 10 pc. So, apparent magnitude is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10 (d/10). 

So, d=10, so log(10/10)=log(1)=0. So m = 15.5 + 0 =15.5 mag. So, Star1's apparent V is 15.5. That's less than 16. So, it can be detected by both because 15.5 <=16. 

Star2: Apparent V is given as 16.5. So, 16.5 is greater than 16. So, HIRES can't observe it (since it can only go up to 16). So, Star2 can't be seen by both. 

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5, but wait, wait. Wait, Star3's parameters are: apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V)=0.6. Oh, wait, the question says that the total absorption in V band is E(B-V) multiplied by 3.1. So, the apparent magnitude is affected by extinction. So, the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v. 

Wait, wait, because E(B-V) is the color excess. The formula for extinction A_v is R * E(B-V), where R is around 3.1. So, A_v = 3.1 * E(B-V). So, for Star3, E(B-V)=0.6, so A_v=3.1 * 0.6=1.86 mag. 

But wait, does that mean that the star's
