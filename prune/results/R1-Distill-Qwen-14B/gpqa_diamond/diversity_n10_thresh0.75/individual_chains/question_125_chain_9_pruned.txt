Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the potential for a harmonic oscillator. So the force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense because F = -kr, and k is related to m ω², I think.

The question is asking for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each part one by one.

First, the energy levels. I remember that in three dimensions, a harmonic oscillator isn't just one-dimensional; it's more complicated. Oh wait, right, in three dimensions, the potential is separable into x, y, z parts, so the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

But wait, I think in three dimensions, the energy levels are quantized differently. For the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy is given by E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Another way to write this is E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the sum of the quantum numbers n_x + n_y + n_z. So n can be 0,1,2, etc.

Now, the third excited state. Wait, excited states are counted starting from the ground state. So the ground state is the first state (n=0?), and each excited state has a higher energy.

Wait, let's clarify. The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be n=0 because n_x = n_y = n_z =0. The first excited state would be the next possible energy level. So the ordering is: ground state (n=0), first excited (n=1), second (n=2), third (n=3), etc.

Wait, but wait. The energy levels in 3D harmonic oscillator are such that each energy level corresponds to a certain n. Each n gives a degenerate level, meaning multiple states with the same energy. So the energy for a given n is E = ħω (n
