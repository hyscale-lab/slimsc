Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out. The question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness variations observed. The goal is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness changes if it were the only thing causing the dips.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, which I know is about 700,000 km or 696,340 km, roughly. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, so 20% of that hemisphere is spots. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temp is 5000 K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. This causes the observed brightness to vary. The question says that this brightness variation is similar to what would be caused by an exoplanet transiting the star. So we need to find the planet's radius relative to the star such that the dip in brightness is the same.

Wait, but the star's spots are causing a dip when they rotate into view, right? Because dark spots are cooler and emit less light. So when the spots face us, the star's total brightness decreases. The dip's amplitude depends on how much of the star's surface is covered in spots and the temperature difference.

I remember that the brightness variation (the amplitude of the light curve) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula: (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But in this case, the star has spots, so the dip is due to the spots being in view. So I need to calculate the equivalent dip caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

The star's hemisphere (so half the surface) is 20% covered in spots. Each spot is cooler, so each spot contributes less flux. The flux from a blackbody is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = sigma * T^4, where sigma is the constant.

The total flux from the star without spots is F_total = sigma * T_star^4 * 4π R_star^2 (since surface area is 4πR²). But when spots are present, part of the surface is at a lower temperature.

But the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, we see one hemisphere at a time. When the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less flux.

Wait, actually, the star's total flux without spots is F0 = sigma T_eff^4 * 4π R^2.

But with spots, the flux when the spot hemisphere is visible is:

F_spot = (1 - 0.2) * (sigma T_eff^4) * 2π R^2 + 0.2 * (sigma (T_eff - 1000 K)^4) * 2π R^2.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let
