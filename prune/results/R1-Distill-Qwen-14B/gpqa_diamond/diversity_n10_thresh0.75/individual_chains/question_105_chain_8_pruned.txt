Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, so the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness over time. The setup is that these spots are on one hemisphere, causing brightness variations when the star rotates. The problem is asking about comparing this situation to an exoplanet transit, which would also cause a dip in brightness when the planet passes in front of the star. The goal is to find what the radius of such a planet would need to be relative to the star to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm, let me start by breaking down the given data. So the star has a radius equal to the Sun, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, filling factor is 20%, that means the spots take up 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (4πRstar² / 2) )? Or wait, no, perhaps the filling factor is the fraction of the stellar surface covered. So if it's 20%, that's 0.2 of the entire star's surface. Hmm, because a hemisphere's area is 2πR², but the whole star is 4πR², so one hemisphere is 50% of the surface. Wait, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20%—so probably, the spots take up 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area with spots is 0.2 * 2π R².

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view from our perspective, causing brightness variations. The same variation amplitude would be caused by an exoplanet transiting in front of the star. So we need to calculate the planet's radius relative to the star such that its transit causes the same dip in brightness.

Wait, but wait. The problem says, "if the star was not covered by spots!" So when the star isn't covered by spots, what's the variation caused by the planet?
