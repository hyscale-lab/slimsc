Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. We're given the X, Y, and Z components of the operator P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. We need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Hmm. So first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the operator for spin along a direction n is given by the dot product of the Pauli matrices and the direction vector. So if n is in the x-z plane, it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

The operator P is given by the vector components. Wait, P is the operator along an arbitrary direction n. So the operator should be something like P = (P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z). But each component (P_x, etc.) is given as a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P along direction n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ) would be:

P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z

But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P becomes:

P = (sinθ)(P_x) + (cosθ)(P_z)

Let me compute this.

P = sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Adding these matrices together:

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2) * (cosθ)
The (1,2) element is (ħ/2) * sinθ
The (2,1) element is (ħ/2) * sinθ
The (2,2) element is (ħ/2) * (-cosθ)

So P can be written as:

P = (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Wait, because (1,1) is cosθ * ħ/2, (1,2) is sinθ * ħ/2, same for (2,1), and (2,2) is -cosθ * ħ/2.

We're to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the equation is (P - (ħ/2) I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (P - (ħ/2) I) is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] - (ħ/2) I

Which equals:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -
