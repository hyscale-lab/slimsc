Hmm, okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me take it step by step.

The question is asking which of the given physical theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

First, I need to understand what regularization is. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are situations where the calculations lead to infinities, which aren't physically meaningful. Regularization helps to make these infinities manageable so that you can subtract them (renormalization), leading to finite results. But some theories don't require regularization because they're already finite, meaning their calculations don't lead to these divergences.

So the question is about which theory never needs this regularization. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories are different because they don't involve quantum mechanics. In classical electrodynamics, there are no infinities in the same way. For instance, when calculating the energy of a charge distribution, it might get complicated, but I don't think it leads to divergences that require regularization. Because regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So classical theories don't require regularization because they don't have these divergent loop integrals or other issues that QFTs have.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory, and I remember that it does require regularization. Because when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy or the photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. These divergences are handled by regularization methods like introducing a cutoff or dimensional regularization. Then, you renormalize the theory by absorbing these infinities into counterterms, which gives finite, meaningful results. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. QCD calculations also involve loops and divergences, so regularization is needed here too. Plus, QCD has phenomena like asymptotic freedom, which means that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, but even so, the loop integrals can still diverge. So regularization is required in QCD as well.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory that incorporates supersymmetry. String theories in general are supposed to be finite because they're higher-dimensional and have a different structure. In string theory, instead of point particles, you have strings, and interactions are described by worldsheet diagrams. Because of the way the theory is formulated, the divergences that occur in point particle theories (like QED loops) are absent or naturally regularized. So superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it's a background-independent theory where such divergences don't appear as they do in QFT.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: some theories require regularization because they have divergences, but maybe some don't. So which of the options don't need regularization.

Looking back, the question is which theory never requires regularization. So
