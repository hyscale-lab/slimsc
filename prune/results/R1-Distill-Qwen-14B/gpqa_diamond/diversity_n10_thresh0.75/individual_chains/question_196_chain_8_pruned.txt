Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I think that means we have to consider Einstein's theory of relativity, probably special relativity, because we're dealing with speeds that might approach the speed of light.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The setup is a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but since it's relativistic, maybe the energy expressions are different.

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So at maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². Then, the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², so setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m) = (sqrt(k/m)) * A. So in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt(kA²/m), which matches option C. But wait, the question is relativistic, so that's probably not the correct answer.

In the relativistic scenario, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to set the total mechanical energy equal to the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy E is (1/2)kA², right? Because at maximum displacement, all energy is potential. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, is the potential energy still (1/2)kx²? I think so, because Hooke's law is a force law, and the potential energy comes from integrating the force, which is linear in x.

So in the relativistic case, the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy. At
