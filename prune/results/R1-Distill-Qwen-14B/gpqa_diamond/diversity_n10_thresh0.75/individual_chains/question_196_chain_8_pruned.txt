Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed v_max of the mass, and the options are given as A, B, C, D.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed when it passes through the equilibrium position. The maximum speed is related to the amplitude and the spring constant. But this is a relativistic case, so things are different because of the speed limits and relativistic effects.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed v_max would be (kA/m)^½, right? Because the potential energy at maximum displacement A is (1/2)kA², which converts into kinetic energy (1/2)mv² at the equilibrium point. So solving for v gives sqrt(kA²/m).

But wait, this is relativistic, so we can't use the same formulas. Relativistic dynamics come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light c. So the energy expressions change.

In relativity, the total energy E of a particle is given by gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But this is a harmonic oscillator, so the total energy would be the sum of kinetic and potential energy. Wait, but in the relativistic case, the potential energy isn't just (1/2)kx², maybe? Or is it?

I think the problem still uses Hooke's law, so F = -kx, which implies the potential energy is (1/2)kx², same as before. But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. So the total energy E is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and potential energy.

But wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is shared between kinetic and potential as the oscillator moves. At the maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at the equilibrium point, it's all kinetic. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, so when the oscillator is at maximum displacement x = A, the potential energy is (1
