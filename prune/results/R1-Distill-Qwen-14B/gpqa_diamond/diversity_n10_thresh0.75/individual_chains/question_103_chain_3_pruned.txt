Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which option gives the correct order.

First, let me understand the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking it down, the substituents on the benzene ring are a nitro group and a bromo group. The nitro group is at the 5 position, and bromo at the 3 position. So, the benzene ring has substituents in the meta positions relative to each other. Additionally, there's an ethanone group (a ketone with a methyl group attached) attached to the benzene. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Let me structure this correctly.

Wait, the structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethanone is attached to the benzene ring. Ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. The substituent at position 3 is bromo, and position 5 is nitro. The ketone (ethan-1-one) is attached at position 1, but wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering would be such that the substituents are in the correct positions. So the substituents are in positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. Because the main chain is ethan-1-one, which is (R)C-O, so the ketone is attached to the benzene, which is in position 1. So the benzene ring has the ketone at position 1, and then substituents at 3 and 5. So the ring has substituents at positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it mentally.

Wait, I think benzene is a ring with three substituents: the ketone group (as a substituent attached to the ring), and the bromine and nitro groups in the meta positions relative to each other. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is attached to the ethanone. So the ethanone is (CH3)CO-, attached to the benzene ring. The benzene has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2) relative to the point of attachment of the ketone.

Wait, so the benzene ring is connected to the ketone (at position 1, say), and then the Br is at position 3, and NO2 at position 5. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other on the benzene ring. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a ketone group (acetyl
