Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which is a broad region usually indicative of O-H or N-H stretches. But since there's no mention of amides or amines, I'll think O-H, like a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. Wait, but wait—there's also a strong peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids typically show a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300. The 1720 is a bit lower than a typical carboxylic acid (which is usually around 1700, but can vary), but maybe it's a conjugated ester or something else. Alternatively, it could be an acyl chloride, but those usually have higher wavenumbers, like around 1800. Hmm, not sure yet.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, integrating to 1H. That's a pretty downfield shift. For aromatic protons, that's unusual because aromatic protons typically are around 6.5-8.5 ppm. Wait, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? No, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. But wait, maybe a carboxylic acid proton? But that's usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So a -COOH group would have a broad peak for the -OH proton. Alternatively, an enol proton could be around there, but that might not fit the other data.

Then there's a peak at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's probably two aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The coupling as a doublet suggests they're next to each other, but in a para-substituted ring, the protons would be equivalent and might appear as a doublet if there's a substituent on the ring that causes splitting. Wait, no, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions, the protons might be split by neighboring groups. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-substituted benzene with another substituent causing the splitting.

Then at 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's another set of two protons, also as a doublet. This might be the other pair of aromatic protons in the ring, possibly meta to the substituents. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, if you have two substituents, the protons could be in positions that are doublets due to coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two substituents that cause the neighboring protons to split into doublets.

Moving on, the next peak is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet integrating for one proton. That could be a CH adjacent to an electronegative group, maybe a carbonyl. Like a CH next to a ketone or ester group. Or perhaps a CH in a chain, like a CH2 or CH group attached to something.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), another multiplet, this time two protons. Maybe a CH2 group next to a CH or another group. Perhaps part of a chain like -CH2-CH2-.

Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a triplet of three protons. Wait, no, a doublet. So a methyl group attached to a CH2 or something that splits it into a doublet. Maybe a methyl adjacent to a CH2, like in an isobutyl group. So perhaps a (CH2)2CH3 group where the CH is split into a doublet because the adjacent CH2 has two protons.

And finally, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). A triplet integrating for three protons, likely a methyl group at the end of a chain, like in an ethyl group. So maybe a CH2CH3 group where the CH3 is at the end and shows as a triplet because it's next to a CH2.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. From the aromatic NMR peaks, it seems like a para-substituted benzene. Let's think: two substituents in the para positions. One substituent is perhaps a group that causes the adjacent protons to split into doublets.

Wait, another thought: the 10.5 ppm peak could be an aldehyde proton, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a phenol O-H, but that's usually broader and maybe a bit upfield. But the 1720 cm-1 might not fit a phenol.

Wait, another angle: the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. The O-H stretch in the IR would be around 2500-3300, but the 3400-2500 is a broad region. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H around 3000 cm-1 and a strong C=O around 1700. So the 1720 is a bit high for a carboxylic acid, maybe a ketone? Or perhaps an ester?

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid's -COOH proton. So perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, maybe the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a -COOH group and another substituent. Let me try to sketch this.

The aromatic protons: if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and those at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So in the NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) could be the protons ortho to the substituents, and 7.2 (d, 2H) could be the para
