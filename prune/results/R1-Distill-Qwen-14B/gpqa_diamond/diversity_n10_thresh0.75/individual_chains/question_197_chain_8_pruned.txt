Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI is a common reagent used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe some kind of substitution. Wait, no, wait. Oh right! Red phosphorus and HI is usually used for the hydrolysis of an alkyl chloride, but wait, that's more of a reaction where maybe you're dealing with a nitrile. Or wait, no, wait, another thought: when you have a nitrile, sometimes you can perform a hydrolysis under acidic conditions to form a carboxylic acid. But wait, red phosphorus is involved in the hydrolysis of nitriles to give amines, isn't it? Or wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is something else. Red phosphorus is often used in the preparation of the Hunsdiecker reaction, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Or wait, maybe it's the hydrolysis of an alkyne? Because I remember that under certain conditions, like with mercury or other catalysts, alkynes can hydrolyze to ketones or carboxylic acids. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus is involved in that.

Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI could be part of the reaction for the formation of a Grignard reagent, but I don't think so. Or maybe it's about the Staudinger reaction, but that's for azides. Hmm. Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an alkyne using red phosphorus and HI to form a carbonyl group. Oh, right! I think that's it. The reaction where an alkyne is treated with red phosphorus and HI leads to the formation of a ketone or a carboxylic acid, depending on the structure. So, if the alkyne is terminal, it would form a carboxylic acid, and if it's internal, it would form a ketone. Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely confident about that. Maybe I should think more about the reagents.

Wait, the reaction in question is Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The product options are all substituted benzene rings with various substituents. Let me think about the data given for Compound X.

The IR spectrum has strong absorption around 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But wait, looking at the peaks: 3400–2500 is a broad region. But then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretches. So, putting that together, maybe Compound X has both an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group, possibly a benzene ring with a ketone or an acid group.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows:
