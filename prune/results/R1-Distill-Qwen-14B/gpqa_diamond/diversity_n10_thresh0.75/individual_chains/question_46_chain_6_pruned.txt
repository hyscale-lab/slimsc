Okay, so I've got this question about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my olefin metathesis reactions, but let's try to think this through.

First, what's racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene? Racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. So the molecule has a double bond and a stereocenter. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene structure... let me draw that out. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on the third carbon? Wait, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, maybe I got that wrong. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? No, wait, wait. I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the third carbon (C3) has a methyl group. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3
