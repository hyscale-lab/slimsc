Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically involving a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees, which is pretty sharp, like a very pointy diamond shape maybe.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think interplanar distance relates to how atoms are spaced between different planes in the crystal structure. Oh right, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + hl + kl) * (cosθ) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Or wait, I think the general formula uses the reciprocal of the structure factor or something with the metric tensor.

Wait another thought: the interplanar distance formula for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles alpha, beta, gamma between them can be found using the formula from the Miller indices (hkl). The formula is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 (sin^2 alpha)/(sin^2 gamma)) + similar terms for k and l and cross terms... Hmm, maybe I should think about the metric tensor approach.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is simpler because in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are the same. So maybe the formula simplifies. Let me think. The general formula for interplanar distance is d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2)/(a^2) + (k^2)/(b^2) + (l^2)/(c^2) - 2hk cos(beta)/(ab) - 2hl cos(alpha gamma)/(ac) - 2kl cos(alpha beta)/(bc) ) ) ? Wait, no, that seems complicated. I remember that for a cubic system, it's easier because a = b = c and angles are 90 degrees. But for rhombohedral, the angles are same but not 90.

Wait, another approach: The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the formula d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/(a^2) + k^2/(b^2) + l^2/(c^2)) + (hk (cos
