Okay, so I have this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) is given by the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices and the lattice parameters. Oh wait, yes, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles?), but I'm not exactly sure about the exact expression.

Wait, no, I think it's the Miller indices h, k, l that come into play here. Oh right, the general formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is d_(hkl) = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + ... ). But wait, that's probably for a cubic system. Since this is a rhombohedral crystal, which is a type of hexagonal system, maybe the formula is a bit different.

Rhombohedral systems have all sides equal (a = b = c) but the angles are not 90 degrees. The formula for interplanar distance in such cases might involve the angles between the lattice vectors. I think the formula is something like d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ). Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system, there's a term that includes the angles between the axes.

Let me try to write the formula correctly. Oh right! The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, no, wait. I think it's more precise to say that the formula for d is derived from the structure factor and the Miller indices, taking into account the lattice parameters and the angles between the lattice vectors. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: for a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The interplanar distance can be calculated using the formula involving the angles. So the formula should be something like:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l
