Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A, yielding 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to select the right reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

First, I remember that 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine. The product looks like it has a new cyclohexylidene group attached. Wait, cyclohexylidene is like a cyclohexene ring with a double bond, right? So maybe the reaction is forming an imine or some kind of enamine.

Wait, no, wait. Enamines are typically formed from amines and ketones or aldehydes. The process usually involves an aldehyde or ketone reacting with an amine in an acid-catalyzed condensation. So the amine would attack the carbonyl, form an imine intermediate, which then loses water to form the enamine. But wait, in this case, what's the starting material and what's being added?

The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. So when it reacts with compound A, which is either cyclohexanecarbaldehyde or vinylcyclohexane. Let's think about each option.

Option A: A is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, catalyst is TsOH. TsOH is a strong acid catalyst, often used in such condensations. So if A is an aldehyde, and the amine is 3-methylpyrrolidine, then perhaps they're undergoing a condensation reaction. The product would have a cyclohexylidene group attached to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, the product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So the cyclohexylidene is attached to the pyrrolidine's nitrogen. So, perhaps the aldehyde (compound A) is reacting with the amine.

In the presence of acid, the aldehyde would form an imine with the amine. But wait, if the amine is secondary, like pyrrolidine, can it form an imine? Wait, wait. Pyrrolidine is a secondary amine. Typically, imine formation
