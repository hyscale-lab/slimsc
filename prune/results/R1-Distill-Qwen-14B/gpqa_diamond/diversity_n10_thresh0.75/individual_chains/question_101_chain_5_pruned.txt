Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I'm supposed to select the correct reagent A and catalyst B from the options given.

First, I need to understand what's happening in the reaction. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a cyclic amine. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Looking at the product, it seems like a cyclohexylidene group is attached to the pyrrolidine ring. So, I'm guessing this is some kind of ring-forming reaction or maybe an addition followed by cyclization.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Cyclohexylidene implies a cyclohexene ring (so a six-membered ring with a double bond). The 'idene' part indicates the position of the double bond. So, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a substituent attached to the cyclohexene ring. Hmm, perhaps a bridge or a substituent at a specific position.

I think this is a case of a ring expansion or some kind of alkylation. But wait, the starting material is a secondary amine. Acid-catalyzed reactions with amines usually involve protonation of the amine to form an amonium ion, making it a better leaving group or more reactive.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe this is a Claisen or Aldol type reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Mannich reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclization where the amine acts as a nucleophile.

Wait, pyrrolidine is a five-membered ring with four CH2 groups and one NH. 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl group at the 3 position. When it reacts, the product has a cyclohexylidenemethyl group attached at the 1 position. So, the 1 position (which is a carbon adjacent to the nitrogen) now has a substituent that's a cyclohexylidene (cyclohexene) group attached via a methylene (-CH2-).

Let me think about the possible reactions. 3
