Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, also known as formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the constant, the more the complex tends to form.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. So, the blue complex is probably the one with the highest stability, which would have the highest β value. Wait, looking at the given β values: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh, the highest is β3=63, so the dithiocyanato complex is the third one, Co(SCN)_3^2+ maybe?

Wait, wait, no. Let me think. The stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands, up to a point, but it can vary. So β1 is for the monodentate, β2 for the didentate, etc. Wait, but thiocyanate can be either a monodentate (like SCN-) or a bidentate ligand, like NCS^- or something else? Hmm, but the problem says thiocyanate, which is SCN^-.

Wait, actually, when forming complexes, each SCN^- is a monodentate ligand. So for Co(SCN)_n complexes, n would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So the stability constants are for [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)₃]^2-, and [Co(SCN)₄]^4- or something like that. I'm a bit confused about the charges, but maybe I don't need to get into that. The key is the β values.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)₂]^something. Wait, wait. The question says "dithiocyanato" which means two SCN ligands. So that would be the β2 complex. But wait, the β3 is the highest, which would be the triply ligated complex, which is more stable. But the question is about the dithiocyanato, which is the β2.

Wait, no, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So the dithiocyanato is the complex with two SCN- ligands. So that's the [Co(SCN)₂]^{n} complex, where n depends on the charge. Cobalt is II, so each SCN is -, so two of them would make the complex +2 charge. So [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+}.

So the β2 is 40. But why does the highest β (β3=63) correspond to the triply ligated complex. So the most stable is [Co(SCN)3]^{something?} Wait, maybe the β's are for complexes with different numbers of SCN-.

But regardless, the problem is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which has β2=40. So I need to calculate the fraction of Co(SCN)₂^2+ among all the cobalt species.

The approach here is to consider all possible complexes, calculate their concentrations, and find the fraction of the one we're interested in.

The general approach for such problems is to compute the distribution of metal species based on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand.

So, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M.

The relevant species are Co²+ (free ion), [Co(SCN)]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)₂]^{2+}, [Co(SCN)3]^{2-}, and [Co(SCN)4]^4-.

Wait, but wait, Co²+ is the starting point. Each complex is formed by adding SCN^-.

The formation of each complex can be represented as:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ↔ [Co(SCN)_n]^2- + (n-2) e? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the charges wrong. Let me think again.

The charge of [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge) can be found as:

Co²+ is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So total charge is 2 + n*(-1) = 2 -n.

So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1)
n=2: [Co(SCN)₂]^0 (charge 0)
n=3: [Co(SCN)3]^- (charge -1)
n=4: [Co(SCN)4]^2- (charge -2)

But maybe the charge isn't important here. What's important is the stability constants. The β for each complex is given.

The formula for the stability constant βn is [ [Co(SCN)_n] ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

So, for each n, βn = [Co(SCN)_n ] / ( [Co²+][SCN^-]^n )

So, [Co(SCN)_n ] = βn * [Co²+][SCN^-]^n

But since all the complexes are in solution, the sum of their concentrations plus the free Co²+ should equal the total cobalt concentration.

So, let's denote:

[Co²+] = C

[Co(SCN)] = β1 * C * (SCN)^1

[Co(SCN)₂] = β2 * C * (SCN)^2

[Co(SCN)3] = β3 * C * (SCN)^3

[Co(SCN)4] = β4 * C * (SCN)^4

Wait, but these are the concentrations of each complex. The sum of all these plus the free Co²+ is the total Co concentration.

But wait, the free Co²+ is C, and the sum of all complexes is:

Sum = [Co(SCN)] + [Co(SCN)₂] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] 

So, the sum plus C equals c_total (1e-2 M).

But wait, actually, the total Co is:

C + β1 C (SCN) + β2 C (SCN)^2 + β3 C (SCN)^3 + β4 C (SCN)^4 = c_total

We can factor C out:

C [ 1 + β1 (SCN) + β2 (SCN)^2 + β3 (SCN)^3 + β4 (SCN)^4 ] = c_total
