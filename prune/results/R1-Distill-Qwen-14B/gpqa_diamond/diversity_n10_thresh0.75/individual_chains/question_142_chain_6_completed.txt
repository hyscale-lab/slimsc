Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. This looks like a diagonal matrix because the terms are |0><0| and |1><1|.

Let me write out this matrix explicitly. |0> is [1; 0] and |1> is [0; 1]. So |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top-left and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| is 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix becomes [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, but I'm being asked about the geometrical position in qubit space. Oh right, I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

Wait, but ρ here is a mixed state because the density matrix isn't a pure state. How can I tell? Well, a pure state has a density matrix that is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, which would have a trace of 1 and a rank of 1. This ρ is the average of two projectors, so its rank is 2 (since both |0> and |1> are orthogonal and non-zero). So it's a mixed state.

Now, the Bloch sphere for a single qubit uses a vector r = (x, y, z) where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. The density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix.

Wait, let me write that down. For a single qubit, any density matrix can be expressed as:

ρ = (I + x X + y Y + z Z)/2

So comparing that with the given ρ, which is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute this.

Wait, |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ = (I)/2.

But wait, according to the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ = I/2, then:

I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2 ⇒ I = I + r·σ ⇒ r·σ must be zero. Which implies r is the zero vector.

Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That's the origin point in the Bloch sphere. So the density matrix represents the completely mixed state, which makes sense because it's an equal mixture of |0> and |1>, so there's no coherence and maximum entropy.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which must be the correct answer.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal, with entries \( \frac{1}{2} \) on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It represents a mixed state, as it is not a projector (a pure state would have rank 1, but this matrix has rank 2 due to the contributions from both \( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| \) and \( \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \)).

To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) corresponds to the coefficients of the Pauli matrices in the density matrix's decomposition. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} = (X, Y, Z) \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} \) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{2} I = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right).
\]

This implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \), meaning the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) is the zero vector \( (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).
