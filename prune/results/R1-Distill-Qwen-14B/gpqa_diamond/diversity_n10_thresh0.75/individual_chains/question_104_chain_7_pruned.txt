Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. 

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. So both planets have about the same mass. Both orbits are circular, which probably simplifies things.

The key data given are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here. I think the RV method relates the velocity of the star to the mass of the planet. The formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV is something like K = (v * (M_p sin i)) / (M_star^(1/3)) ), but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's more about the mass function.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(c)) ) * (sin i) ) ), but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between the RV shift and the orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, maybe the RV shift is related inversely to the orbital period somehow.

Wait, no, I think the RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (c * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, the eccentricity e is zero, so the denominator simplifies.

But since both stars have the same mass and the planet masses are similar (Neptune), perhaps the main factors are the P and the K. The RV shift K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1
