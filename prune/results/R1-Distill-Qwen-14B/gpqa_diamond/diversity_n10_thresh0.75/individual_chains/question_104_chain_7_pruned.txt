Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines depends on the mass of the planet and the characteristics of its orbit.

The question says that astronomers found one planet each around two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune, and they're in circular orbits. So, the main differences given are the shifts in their spectral lines—Planet #1 has a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 has 7 milliangstrom.

Wait, I think the RV method's measured shift relates to the star's velocity. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / (M_star)^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3), but maybe there's a simpler way here since the stars are the same and the planet masses are similar.

Alternatively, I think the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula K = (v) = (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 year / P)^(1/3) ) ) * something. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between the velocity shift and the orbital period.

Wait, another approach: The RV method detects the star's velocity change, which is given by K = ( (2π G) / (c T) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to consider that the semi-amplitude K of the star's velocity is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), where a is the orbital semi-major axis. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe another way.

Wait, I know that the Doppler shift is related to the velocity. The formula for the Doppler shift in terms of velocity is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But here, the shift is given in milliangstroms, so perhaps it's easier to relate the shifts to the velocities.

The shift in wavelength (delta_lambda) relates to the star's velocity (v) as delta_lambda = (v
