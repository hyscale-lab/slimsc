Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Wait, di-substituted means two substituents, right? The compound has 8 carbons in total. Hmm, so the benzene ring is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add two more carbons. Oh, wait, but waitâ€”benzene has 6, so substituents could be two groups each with one carbon, but that would make 8 in total. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has one. Or maybe one substituent has three carbons and the other has one? Wait, no, let me think. The total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents sum to 2. So maybe two substituents each with one carbon, like two methyl groups. But wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. Oh, so one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or something. Wait, but the substituents are on an aromatic ring, so maybe it's a halogen and a carbonyl group. Wait, the IR says aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, right, aromatic-halogen bonds typically show up around 6-7 ppm in IR. But specifically, the question says the IR has peaks for carbonyl and aromatic-halogen. So substituents are a
