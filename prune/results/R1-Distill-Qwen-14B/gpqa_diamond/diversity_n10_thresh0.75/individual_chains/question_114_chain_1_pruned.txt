Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (in H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents. The options are combinations of H3O+, NaHSO3, HCl, and CH3COOH.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction separately.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one plus NaCN and reagent A gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so it's a ketone. NaCN is a nitrile group source. So, I'm thinking this is a substitution reaction where the ketone gets converted to a cyanohydrin. Wait, a cyanohydrin is when a ketone reacts with CN- to form a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. The general reaction is ketone + CN- â†’ cyanohydrin.

But how does that happen? I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins typically involves a base. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The reaction between a ketone and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) can form the cyanohydrin. But in this case, we're using NaCN, which would provide the CN- ion. So perhaps the mechanism involves acid catalysis?

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN and reagent A. So if A is an acid, like H3O+, that would protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- would attack as a nucleophile, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin. So the first step is acid-catalyzed addition of CN- to the ketone.

So for the first reaction, reagent A would be an acid, perhaps H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and
