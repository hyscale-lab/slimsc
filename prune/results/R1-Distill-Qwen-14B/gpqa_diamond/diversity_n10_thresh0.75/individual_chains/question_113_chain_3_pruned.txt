Alright, let's tackle this problem. Okay, so I've got an unknown compound, and I need to find its formula based on the given spectroscopic data. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. Hmm, I think I should go through each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Because the peak is very broad, maybe it's an alcohol, since carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad peak, but sometimes it depends. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I'm trying to recall what these regions correspond to. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 might be conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with something else. Wait, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an ester or maybe an amide, but there's no mention of amide in the data. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl like in a ketone with conjugation, or maybe an aromatic ring with a carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound must have an alkene group. So the structure has both a carbonyl and an alkene.

Then the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. What is that? Well, 45 is a common mass. Let me think what fragments give m/z 45. Maybe a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is the same as CH3OCH2- or maybe a CH2(OH)CH2- group? Or wait, 45 could be a ketene ion or maybe a (CH3)2CO fragment? No, (CH3)2CO is 58, I think. Alternatively, the fragment could be something like CH2=CH-O-... Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's a CH3CO group. Wait, CH3CO is 43 (12*2+16+1*3 = 24+16+3=43?), no. Or maybe it's from a ketone. Wait, maybe the fragment at 45 is due to a (CH3)2O group? Wait, that's 45? Let me calculate. CH3-O- would be 31 (15 for O, and 2*12 + 6 = 30?), no. Wait, 45 is the mass. Let's compute: 45 is 45 g/mol. So, possible fragments: maybe methyl acetate? No, that would be higher. Wait, another approach: 45 is 45 = 12x + 1y +16z. Let me see: 45 can be, for example, C3H3O (12*3 +1*3 +16 = 36 +3 +16=55, no). Or C2H5O? 24 +5 +16=45. Yes! So that could be ethyl group with an oxygen, like OCH2CH3. Wait, but the fragment is m/z 45, which would be the mass of the fragment. Ethyl group (C2H5) is 29. So OCH2CH3 is 45? Let me check: O is 16, C2H5 is 29 (24 +5). 16+29=45. Yes, so a fragment of OCH2CH3 would give m/z 45. So that suggests that the compound might have an ethoxy group.

Wait, but why that fragment? Mass spec tends to break bonds. So if the compound has an ester group, like R-O-CO-R', then maybe the ester oxygen could break, leading to an ethyl (or other) fragment. Or perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an adjacent ethyl group.

Wait, let me think about the possible functional groups. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, so O-H is likely. Also, the carbonyl at 1700 suggests maybe an ester or ketone. Wait, esters have carbonyls around 1740-1700 cm⁻¹, and ketones around 1700-1680. So 1700 could be either. The 1650 peak might be a conjugated carbonyl, so perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would be a conjugated system between the carbonyl and a double bond. So maybe the structure has a conjugated enone or something like that.

So combining the FTIR data: O-H (alcohol or carboxylic acid), carbonyl group (ester, ketone, aldehyde?), and maybe an ester since the ester carbonyl is around 1700. Also, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond.

Wait, but what about the O-H? If it's an alcohol, then the formula would have one O (like C6H12O), but if it's a carboxylic acid, then maybe two O's (like C6H12O2). Hmm, but the FTIR's broad peak could also be an alcohol. Let me not get stuck here yet.

Looking at the mass spec again. The fragment at 4
