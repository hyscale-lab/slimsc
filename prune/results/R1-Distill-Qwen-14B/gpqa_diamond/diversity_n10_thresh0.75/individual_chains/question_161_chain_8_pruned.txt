Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscopy question. Let me see what I remember. So, the scenario is about a transmission electron microscope with a high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. Mike is using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 1e-9 Torr. But even with that, some gas particles are still there because the mass spectrometer detected them. 

He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the compartment's volume. 

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2, which is different from λ1. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't affect it. Hmm, why would λ change?

Wait, the mean free path in a vacuum is usually calculated using the formula λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where n is the number density of the gas and σ is the collision cross-section. Or maybe it's λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * n), where d is the diameter of the gas molecules. Either way, the main factors are pressure and the properties of the gas.

When the electron beam is turned on, the electrons are moving at a high speed, but how does that affect the gas molecules? Wait, the electrons could be causing the gas molecules to ionize or something. If the gas gets ionized, the mean free path might change because charged particles interact differently. 

In a normal vacuum, the mean free path is based on elastic collisions between gas molecules. But if the electrons are causing some of them to become ions, those ions might have a longer mean free path because they're charged and might interact more with the walls or other particles. Or wait, maybe the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, which would reduce the effective number of gas particles in the compartment.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be bombarded, leading to more frequent collisions. Wait, but the electron beam is focused on the sample, not necessarily all over the compartment. So maybe the gas near the sample is more affected.

Wait no, in the presence of an electron beam, especially a high-energy one like 1000 kV, the gas molecules might get excited or ionized. When a gas is ionized, the mean free path can change. Because ions can have different collision cross-sections. Or perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to surfaces, which would effectively reduce the pressure, thereby increasing the mean free path because lower pressure means longer λ.

Wait, because the mean free path λ is inversely proportional to pressure. If the effective pressure decreases when some gas is ionized and removed, then λ would increase. So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Wait, but Mike detected gas particles with the mass spectrometer. So perhaps the presence of the electron beam is causing some of the gas to be removed or ionized, leading to a lower number of neutral gas molecules. That would lower the pressure, which would mean a longer mean free path.

So the original mean free path λ1 was calculated based on the existing pressure. But when the electron beam starts, some gas is ionized or removed, effectively lowering the pressure in the compartment. So n (number density) would decrease, which according to the mean free path formula, would increase λ. Because λ is inversely proportional to n.

So λ2 would be greater than λ1. Now looking at the options: option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. If λ2 is larger, that's possible. But why 1.22? Hmm, 1.22 is approximately sqrt(2)* something. Wait, the mean free path formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 * n * σ), where σ is the collision cross-section. Alternatively, another form
