Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I need to figure out what the product is, given the IR and NMR data for Compound X and the options provided.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR spectrum shows peaks around 3400–2500 cm-1. That broad region usually indicates the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe an amine (N-H). But wait, another peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Also, there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting that together, I think the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and perhaps a hydroxyl group or an amine.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet around 10.5. That's a high chemical shift. Could this be an aldehyde proton? Wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes they can be a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. But wait, the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2500-3000 (like a broad peak for an -OH in a carboxylic acid), but the region 3400–2500 is broad, which could include an O-H or N-H stretch. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic -OH, but those are usually broad, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the 1720 cm-1 in IR is a strong carbonyl. If the compound is a ketone, then maybe the proton at 10.5 is something else. Or, maybe it's an aldehyde. But aldehydes are usually less than 10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha proton to a carbonyl, but that's usually around 2-3 ppm, unless it's a conjugated system or something else.

Looking further down the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That splitting suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, the two doublets are probably the two sets of protons on the benzene ring, each as a doublet, which would be the case if they're each adjacent to substituents in the para positions. So perhaps, the ring has two substituents in para positions, each with two protons each.

Then, the other signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). So, let's parse this.

The 2.9 ppm (m) could be a methylene (CH2) next to an electronegative atom, like maybe adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be another CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet as a doublet, which is a CH3 group attached to a CH, since the splitting is a doublet. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, like from an ethyl group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with substituents at para positions. One substituent is an ethyl group attached in some way, and another is a ketone or aldehyde group.

Wait, but the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, so maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Then, perhaps the structure is an aromatic aldehyde
