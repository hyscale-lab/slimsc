Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through the question carefully.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options given are A, B, C, D. The data provided includes IR and NMR spectra for Compound X.

First, I should analyze the spectral data to determine the structure of Compound X. Then, I'll think about what reaction occurs when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. 

Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or possibly an N-H stretch, but since the options don't have amines, I can focus on O-H. The peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be from a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching, so that suggests an aromatic ring is present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm usually indicates an aldehyde proton (-CHO). Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton, but carboxylic acids are usually more downfield, but they can be broad. However, the presence of other peaks might help clarify this.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 in IR could be a ketone, which doesn't have an aldehyde. Wait, hold on: If the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde, then the carbonyl would be at 1720, which makes sense. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, but the problem is that the IR shows a peak at 1720. A carboxylic acid would have a much broader O-H and possibly a C=O around 1700. Wait, but in the IR, the first region is 3400–2500, which might include O-H from a carboxylic acid, but then the 1720 is the carbonyl. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me keep looking at NMR.

Other NMR peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) – these are typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring. The coupling suggests two doublets, which is typical for a para-substituted benzene, where two protons are in one position and two in the other. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – maybe a CH group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or an ester. Or perhaps a CH next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be another CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of three protons, perhaps a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, likely from an ethyl group.

Putting this together: the aromatic ring has a substituent which is perhaps an ethyl group and another substituent which is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, but if it's an aldehyde, it would be a triplet because of coupling with the adjacent CH, but wait, no, in an aldehyde, the proton is usually a singlet because there are no adjacent hydrogens (as aldehydes have R-CHO, so the CH is only attached to the carbonyl, so the aldehyde proton is a singlet). So that makes sense.

So perhaps the structure is an aromatic aldehyde with an ethyl group attached.

Wait, let's think about the substituents on the benzene ring. The two doublets (each 2H) suggest a di-substituted benzene, para to each other. So one substituent is an aldehyde group (-CHO), and the other substituent is an ethyl group or something else.

But wait, the NMR shows a 1.4 ppm doublet (3H), which is a methyl group attached to something. The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group attached near the aldehyde. Hmm, perhaps a CH2CH2CH3 group? No, maybe a CH(CH2CH3) group.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Let's say the benzene has two substituents: one is -
