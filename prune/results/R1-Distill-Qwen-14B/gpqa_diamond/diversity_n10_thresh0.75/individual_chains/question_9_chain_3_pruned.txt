Okay, so I need to figure out which of these molecules has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that C3h symmetry implies a certain kind of symmetry. Wait, what's C3h again? Oh right, it's a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-trifuran compound, and a triphenyleno-trifuran compound. Let me think about each one.

Starting with triisopropyl borate. Borate structures usually have a boron atom with three substituents. Triisopropyl borate would have three isopropyl groups attached to boron. Isopropyl groups have a symmetric structure themselves. So the molecule would be trigonal planar around boron. Does that lead to C3h symmetry? Well, if all three substituents are the same, then yes. Triisopropyl would have three identical groups, so that's symmetric. The molecule would look the same upon 120-degree rotations. But wait, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Let me visualize it. The molecule is flat, so if I imagine a mirror cutting through the plane of the boron and the substituents, each substituent would mirror the others. So yes, maybe triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry. Oh wait, but wait, the mirror plane in C3h is horizontal, which would be perpendicular to the rotation axis. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again. The C3 axis would be perpendicular to the mirror plane. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that includes that axis. For example, in a trigonal planar molecule, the C3 axis is through the central atom, and the mirror planes are each bisecting two substituents. Wait, but C3h includes a horizontal mirror plane, which in this context would be the same as the plane of the molecule if it's flat. So in a trigonal planar molecule, which has a C3 axis and three σ mirror planes, but maybe that's not exactly C3h. Wait, maybe C3h is a combination where the
