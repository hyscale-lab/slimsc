Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma rays and their annihilation with the CMB. Hmm, I need to figure out up to what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. 

Wait, the process is gamma + gamma from CMB → e+ e-. So, this must be about the interaction of high-energy gamma-rays with the CMB photons. I remember that when two photons collide, they can produce electron-positron pairs if their combined energy is enough to create the rest mass of the particles. 

The key here is probably the condition for this annihilation to occur. The center-of-mass energy must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, which is 2*m_e*c². Wait, no, m_e is the electron mass, so 2*m_e*c² is twice the rest energy. Right, because the pair has two particles.

Wait, actually, for pair production, the center-of-mass energy of the two photons must be at least 2*m_e*c². So, the threshold condition is sqrt(s) >= 2*m_e*c², where s is the square of the total energy in the center-of-mass frame.

But wait, the problem is about the lifetime of the gamma-rays being limited by this process. Gamma rays have very short lifetimes usually, but in the context of the universe, their mean free path determines how far they can travel before annihilating. So, if the gamma-ray's energy is such that it can interact with CMB photons to produce e+ e-, then their lifetime (or mean lifetime) would be limited by this interaction.

So, the mean free path is the average distance the gamma-ray travels before annihilating. If the mean free path is smaller than the size of the universe, then the gamma-rays wouldn't be observed because they'd annihilate quickly. So the energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the universe's size (or the lifetime is around the age of the universe) would be the cutoff.

But how do we compute the minimum energy where this process becomes significant? I think the approach is to consider the cross-section for this annihilation process and then compute the optical depth. The optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section σ, the photon density n, and the path length L. When τ is about 1, the process is significant, meaning the gamma-ray has a reasonable chance to annihilate.

So, τ ≈ σ * n * L. We want τ ≈ 1 for the process to limit the gamma's lifetime.

But the problem is just asking for the energy where the gamma's lifetime is limited by this process, implying that the photon's lifetime is so short that they don't propagate far. So perhaps when the mean free time is comparable to the age of the universe. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact treatment here; maybe the condition is when the annihilation rate is significant.

Alternatively, the energy E where the cross-section becomes such that the lifetime is determined by this interaction.

Wait, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into e+ e- is known. For high energies, the cross-section increases, I think, because the photons can more easily produce pairs when their energy is higher.

The threshold energy for pair production is when the photon energy is such that each photon has energy E_photon >= m_e c² / 2. But wait, in this case, since the CMB photons are at low energy, you need a high-energy gamma to interact with a CMB photon to produce a pair.

Wait, so the gamma-ray has energy E and the CMB photon has energy E_cmbr. The condition for pair production is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is enough to create the rest mass.

Wait, the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) = sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2 ), but in this case, since the photons are moving in opposite directions, the momenta are opposite, but magnitude-wise, it's (E1/c) and (E2/c) for each photon. So,
