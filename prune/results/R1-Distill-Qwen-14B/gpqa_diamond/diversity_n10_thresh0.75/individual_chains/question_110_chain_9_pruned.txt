Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me. It's about determining which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. I'm a bit rusty on my star observation limits, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that the key factors here are the apparent magnitudes of the stars, because both spectrographs have different brightness limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than magnitude 17, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16. So, the star's apparent V magnitude has to be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star has an apparent magnitude of 16, it's brighter than 17. So for a star to be observable, its apparent magnitude needs to be less than or equal to the limit. So, for ESPRESSO, apparent V mag <=17. For HIRES, <=16.

So the stars must be detectable by both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=17 and <=16? Wait no, because each spectrograph has its own limit. So a star must be observable by both, meaning its apparent magnitude must be <=17 for ESPRESSO and also <=16 for HIRES. Wait, noâ€”because if a star is brighter than 16, it's observable by HIRES, but maybe not by ESPRESSO if it's too faint. Or wait, no: ESPRESSO can go up to 17, which is fainter than 16, so if a star is brighter than 16, it's within the limit for both. Or wait, no. Let me clarify:

- HIRES can observe stars with V mag <=16, meaning they are brighter than 16. Because higher magnitudes are fainter. So the limit is mag brighter than 16.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" by ESPRESSO. So, the magnitude has to be less than 17. Because lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star's apparent V mag is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly
