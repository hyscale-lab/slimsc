Okay, so I have this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, right, I remember from my astronomy class that these instruments have different capabilities. Let me think through each star step by step.

The question gives some key points. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, brighter than 17 means lower numbers, right? So it can see stars up to 17 mag. HIRES can go brighter than 16 mag. So anything brighter than 16 would be observable by HIRES, and up to 17 by ESPRESSO. So the stars need to be detectable by both, meaning their apparent V magnitudes should be <=16 (since HIRES can't go beyond that) but also <=17. Wait, no, wait. The question says that with ESPRESSO, stars brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So wait, I'm getting confused. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. So for ESPRESSO, it can see stars with V mag brighter than 17, meaning apparent V mag <=17. For HIRES, they can observe stars brighter than 16, so apparent V mag <=16.

So for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V mag must be <=16. Because if it's higher than 16, HIRES can't observe it. But wait, let's check each star.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1: Absolute magnitude is 15.5. Distance is 10 pc. Hmm, absolute magnitude (M) is how bright it appears at 10 pc. So if it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude (m) is same as M. So m = 15.5. Is 15.5 <=16? Yes. So HIRES can see it because it's <=16. What about ESPRESSO? It's 15.5 which is <=17, so yes. So Star1 can be observed by both. So Star1 is a candidate.

Star2: Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. So that's
