Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, eigenvalues... right, that's the energy levels the system can have.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Wait, σ is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. Oh right, σ · n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices vector and the unit vector n. So I think σ · n is like σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z, since each Pauli matrix is multiplied by the corresponding component of n.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each of them has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you take a linear combination, like a dot product with a unit vector, does that change the eigenvalues?

Oh, wait, the Pauli matrices are spin matrices, which are related to spin angular momentum. The eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1 because each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1, and when combined in a direction n, the eigenvalues still are ±1. But wait, the Hamiltonian H is ε times that. So the eigenvalues should be ±ε, right?

Wait, because if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, multiplying by ε gives ±ε as the eigenvalues of H. So the possible eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

So looking at the options, option B is +ε and −ε. Option B says exactly that.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Oh, Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. So when you have a term like σ · n, it's a Hermitian matrix, and its eigenvalues lie between -1 and 1. But here, each component is multiplied by n_i, which is a unit vector, so the maximum eigenvalue would be 1 and minimum -1. So yes, for any direction n, the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1. So H = ε (σ ·n), eigenvalues would be ε*(±1), so ±ε.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait
