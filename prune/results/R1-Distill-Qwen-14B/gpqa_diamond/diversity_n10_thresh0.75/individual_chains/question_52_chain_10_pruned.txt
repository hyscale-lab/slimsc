Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the problem is about a star with certain parameters. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

The transition between these levels is at 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. And we're told to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this calculation.

Hmm, right. The Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Where g2 and g1 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energy levels, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff decreases. But wait, what's the effective temperature? I remember that the effective temperature is the temperature of a black body that would emit the same amount of radiation as the star. So when parts of the star are cooler (spots), the overall emission is less, so the effective temperature is lower.

But wait, when considering the photosphere, each part of the surface has its own temperature. The spots are cooler regions, right? So when 40% of the surface is spots, the rest is at 6000 K, and the spots are presumably at a lower temperature. But wait, the problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. Do I need to find the temperature of the spots? Oh, maybe not directly. Because the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So when the star has spots, what temperature are we considering for that calculation?

Wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. But wait, does that mean that the entire photosphere is at 5500 K, or is it a mix of regions at different temperatures? Because in reality, the star's surface would have some areas at 6000 K and others (spots) at lower temperatures, say T_spot.

But the way the problem is phrased, when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the Teff is a sort of average, but the
