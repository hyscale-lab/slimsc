Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully and think through it step by step.

So the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question asks by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does have spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. We're told to assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds in the photosphere.

Hmm. So I need to find the ratio (n1/n2) when there are no spots compared to when there are spots. The ratio decreases when spots are present, so the factor should be more than 1.

I remember that in LTE, the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2. So the ratio is n1/n2. Let me think: according to the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1. So n1/n2 would be the reciprocal of that, which is (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(kT) ). 

But wait, the ratio they're observing is n1/n2. The problem says that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when there are spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so what does that do to n1/n2?

Wait, lower T would make the exponential term smaller. Let me see: the ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp(ΔE/(kT)). So if T decreases, the exponent ΔE/(kT) increases, so the exponential term increases. So n1/n2 would increase, right? But the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. Hmm, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I have the levels reversed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the levels mixed up. Let me clarify: the higher energy level is level 2, I suppose. So E2 > E1. Then ΔE = E2 - E1 is positive. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes larger (more positive). So exp(ΔE/(kT)) becomes larger because the denominator is smaller. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(kT)), which would increase as T decreases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I have the energy levels backwards. Suppose E1 is higher than E2. Then ΔE would be negative, so ΔE/(kT) is negative. Then exp(negative) is a fraction. Let me think again. If E1 is higher than E2, then the transition from level 1 to 2 would be a drop in energy, which would emit a photon at 1448 Å. But wait, the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength λ ≈1448 Å. So the energy of that photon would be E = hc/λ. Let me compute that.

Wait, but maybe that's not necessary right now. Let's get back to the ratio. The observed ratio n1/n2 is the number in level 1 over level 2. If the ratio decreases when the star has spots, that means when T is lower (5500 K), n1/n2 is lower than when T is higher (6000 K).

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, n1/n2 increases. So that would mean that when T is lower (with spots), n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps I have the ratio backwards. Maybe it's n2/n1 that's being considered. Let me read the problem again.

The question says: "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So it's n1/n2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. 

So when T is lower, n1/n2 is lower than when T is higher
