Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, that doesn't look quite right. Oh, maybe I misread it. Let me parse that again. Oh, right, the interaction term is probably something like -λ ψ_f^\dagger (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), but the exact form isn't critical right now. The key part is that the boson X is interacting with fermions, so it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermion pairs it can decay into kinematically. Kinematically allowed means that the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions involved, right? Because each fermion would carry half the mass in the decay.

Wait, wait. So each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3. So any fermion pair where each fermion is lighter than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me get the masses of the known fermions straight. The standard model fermion masses are as follows:

Up quark: about 2.2 MeV (so way below 3 GeV)
Down quark: around 4.7 MeV
Strange quark: ~100 MeV
Charm quark: ~1.5 GeV
Bottom quark: ~4.5 GeV
Top quark: way too heavy, ~173 GeV
Electron: negligible, ~0.0005 MeV
Muon: ~0.1 GeV
Tau: ~1.77 GeV
And the others like the others are neutrinos, which are massless for all practical purposes.

So for the decay X → f f-bar, the mass of f must be ≤ 3 GeV.
