Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through step by step. The question is about binary star systems and determining which is more massive based on their radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I remember that in binary star systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method is used to detect these companions based on Doppler shifts in their spectra. The amplitude of the radial velocity (RV) variations depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination of the orbit. Oh wait, but the problem gives me the RV amplitudes for both stars in each system, so maybe I can use that to find their masses.

Wait, wait. I think there's a formula relating the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the mass of the companion. The formula is K = (v) something with the masses. Oh right, the formula is K = ( ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), where P is the orbital period, G is the gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars, and i is the inclination angle. But wait, since the problem says that the periods are calculated as the time between two primary eclipses, I assume that the orbits are edge-on (i=90 degrees), so sin i = 1. That simplifies things a bit.

But wait, in the problem, both stars in each system have their RV amplitudes given. So for system 1, the RVs are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system 2, 15 and 10. Hmm, so each star's velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to their mass. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity, right? Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, from the center of mass condition. So a1 is the semi-major axis of star 1, a2 of star 2. So a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a_total. Since velocity is proportional to a (since v = 2π a / P), the RV amplitude K1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * (2π a_total / P) * ( G (M1+M2) )^(1/3) ) ... Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass function relates the observed velocities. The mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but since i is 90 degrees for eclipsing binaries, sin i is 1. Alternatively, since both stars' velocities are observed, perhaps we can relate them.

Wait, another approach. The sum of the velocities is related to the total mass. Because the center of mass is stationary, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1 / M2 = K2 / K1 for each system.

So for system 1: K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half of M2 in system 1. So the total mass of system 1, M1 + M2, is M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + 0.5) = 1.5 M2.

Wait, wait. Wait, system 1 has K1=10 and K2=5. So M1 K1 = M2 K2. So M1 *10 = M2 *5 → M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So M1 = 0.5 M2, so total mass of system 1 is 0.5 +1 = 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system 2: K1=15, K2=10. So M1' *15 = M2' *10 → M1' = (10/15) M2' = (2/3) M2'. So M1' is two-thirds of M2'. So total mass is M1' + M2' = (2/3 +1) M2' = (5/3) M2'.

Wait, but now I'm comparing the total masses of the two systems. The problem asks, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. Wait, no, the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? Or wait, the question says: By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? So compute (Mass system_1) / (Mass system_2) = ?

Wait, because system_1's total mass is 1.5 M2, and system_2's total mass is (5/3) M2' (but wait M2 is from system 1 and M2' from system 2; maybe I should denote the masses more clearly.

Wait, perhaps I mixed variables. Let me correct that.

Let me denote:

For system 1:

Masses: M1 and M2 (but let's call them M11 and M12 to avoid confusion with system 2).

K11 = 10 km/s, K12 =5 km/s.

So, M11 * K11 = M12 * K12 → M11/M12 = K12/K11 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M11 = 0.5 M12.

Total mass of system_1: M11 + M12 = 0.5 M12 + M12 = 1.5 M12.

For system_2:

K21=15, K22=10.

So M21 *15 = M22 *10 → M21/M22 = 10/15 = 2/3 → M21 = (2/3) M22.

Total mass of system_2: M21 + M22 = (2/3 M22) + M22 = (5/3) M22.

Now, to compare the total masses of system_1 and system_2, I need to relate M12 and M22. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I can use the orbital period, since the period is given for each system. The formula for the period involves the total mass. The period P is related to the total mass M = M1 + M2 via Kepler's third law. But wait, the period is the same as the orbital period, which is given.

The formula is P^2 = (4π²/G(M1+M2)) ) a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars. Alternatively, since a = a1 + a2, and from the center of mass, M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a2 = (M1/M2) a1. So a = a1 + a2 = a1 (1 + M1/M2) = a1 ( (M1 + M2)/M2 ) ). But maybe that's complicating it.

Alternatively, the formula for the period in terms of the RVs. The formula is P = ( (a1 + a2)^3 * (M1 + M2) ) / (G (M1 + M2) ) )^(1/2) ) → I think I'm getting stuck.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the sum of the velocities. K1 + K2 is proportional to (M2
