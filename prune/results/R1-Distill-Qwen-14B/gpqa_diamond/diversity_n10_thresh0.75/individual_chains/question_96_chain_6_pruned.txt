Okay, so I've got this problem about a black hole's entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. Alright, the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon and the distance to the galaxy. I need to find the entropy of the black hole. 

So first, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon, and the constants are the speed of light, reduced Planck constant, gravitational constant, and Boltzmann's constant. But wait, maybe I should just think about area in terms of the radius.

Wait, the angular size θ is given. Oh right! The angular size can help me find the radius of the event horizon. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, where R is the radius and d is the distance. But wait, I think I should be careful with units here. Because θ is in degrees, I should convert that to radians to make the calculations easier. Oh right, because in radians, θ ≈ R/d is a good approximation for small angles.

So θ in radians is (θ in degrees) * (π/180). Let me compute that. The given θ is 1e-17 degrees. So in radians, that's 1e-17 * π/(180). Let me calculate that. π is about 3.14, so 3.14/(180) is roughly 0.01745. So 1e-17 * 0.01745 is approximately 1.745e-19 radians.

So now, R ≈ θ * d. But wait, what's the distance d? It's given as 1e10 parsecs. Oh, I need to convert that into meters because I'm dealing with SI units for physics. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d is 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.
