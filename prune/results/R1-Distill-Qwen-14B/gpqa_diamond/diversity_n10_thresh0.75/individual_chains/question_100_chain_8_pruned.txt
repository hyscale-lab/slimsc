Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions yet. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, C3H6 could be a few things. I remember that for alkenes, the formula is CnH2n. So for n=3, 2n=6, that fits. So Compound A is probably an alkene. The possible alkenes for C3H6 would be propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. Wait, cyclopropane is C3H6 too. But wait, the reaction conditions are bromination in CCl4. Oh right, that's probably an addition reaction. So if it's an alkene, like propene, bromination would add Br2 across the double bond.

So if A is propene (CH2=CH2CH3?), wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When it undergoes bromination in CCl4, which is a non-polar solvent, it would add Br2 across the double bond. So that would make 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Wait, the addition of Br2 to propene typically gives 1,2-dibromopropane. Because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, so adding Br across would lead to Br on each of those carbons. So Compound B would be 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. I think that's an elimination reaction. Because alcoholic KOH is a strong base and heat is often involved, so E2 mechanism. So from 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would remove H and Br from adjacent carbons, forming a double bond again. The product would be propene again. Wait, but wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane. Let me imagine the structure: BrCH2CHBrCH3. No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you add Br2, it becomes CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait. No, wait, no. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the structure is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add Br to each of the double bond carbons, making CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, that's not right. Wait, no, when you add Br2 to propene, you get 1,2-dibromopropane. Which would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3? No, wait. Wait, but propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would make CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait. No, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you add Br2, it's a diaddition. So each of the two carbons in the double bond get a Br. So the product would be CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, but that's 1,2-dibromopropane, right? So the structure is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3.

Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it should eliminate. The base would abstract a Î² hydrogen, leading to the elimination of Br- and the formation of a double bond. The possible products could be propene again, but wait, that's the starting material. But wait, perhaps there's a possibility of forming another alkene? Wait, no, the starting alkene is propene. So when you eliminate from 1,2-dibromopropane, you can get back propene. So Compound C would be propene again. Wait, but wait another possibility: if the Br is on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a more substituted alkene. But prop
