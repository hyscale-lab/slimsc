Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read through it carefully. 

The problem says that there's a solution containing Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants, or formation constants, tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form. So each β corresponds to a different complex. Let's think about the complexes.

Co(II) can form different complexes with SCN-. The complexes are probably [Co(SCN)n]^m+ where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands. The β values given are for the stepwise formation, I think. Like, β1 would be the formation of the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So, the complexes are:

- [Co(SCN)]^2+ (n=1) with β1=9.
- [Co(SCN)2]^2+ (n=2) with β2=40.
- [Co(SCN)3]^2+ (n=3) with β3=63.
- [Co(SCN)4]^2+ (n=4) with β4=16.

Wait, wait, but sometimes β is defined as the overall formation constant for the complex. Oh, but in this case, the β values are given for each step. So for each additional SCN adding. So the overall formation constant for the nth complex would be the product of β1 to βn. Or maybe each β is the cumulative constant? No, I think in stability constants, β is often the step constant. So to get the overall, we multiply them.

Wait, no. Wait, the stepwise constant is βn, which is the constant for adding the nth ligand. So the overall K for the complex would be the product. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, K = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the formation constants are the cumulative ones. Let me think: for example, for [CoSCN]^2+ (n=1), β1 is 9. For [Co(SCN)2]^2+, β2 is 40, but that's the constant for adding the second SCN, so the total would be β1 * β2 for the second complex. But sometimes, in some textbooks, the overall β is given. Hmm, the problem states the stability constants are β1, β2, etc., so probably each is the stepwise constant. So the overall β for each complex is the product up to that step.

Wait, but let me clarify. The stability constant for a complex is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex from its ions. For the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^2+, the formation would be:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)]^2+; K = β1 = 9.

For the second complex, [Co(SCN)2]^2+, it's formed from the first complex plus another SCN^-:

[Co(SCN)]^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]^2+; K = β2 =40.

So the overall K for the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

Similarly, the overall K for [Co(SCN)3]^2+ is β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=25200.

And for [Co(SCN)4]^2+, the overall K is β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= let me calculate that. 9*40 is 360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16= 362880.

Wait, but wait a second, the β4 is 16. So when n=4, the overall β is 9*40*63*16. But wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, considering that each β is the stepwise, the overall for each complex is the product of β1 to βn. So for n=4, it's the product of all four βs.

Wait, but I might be getting confused here. Another approach is to think about the fractions of each species based on the log of the overall β. The species with higher overall β will dominate.

But the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, what's the blue one? I remember that the [Co(SCN)6]^3+ is the intensely colored one, like blood red, but I'm not sure about the blue. Wait, maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)4]^2+? Or perhaps the question refers to [Co(SCN)2]^2+ as blue. Hmm, but I'm not entirely certain about the color here. Maybe the blue is the tetra or di complex. Wait, the problem says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN per Co. So the complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2+. So the question is about the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ in the solution.

So, to find the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ among all Co species.

The total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M. So all the Co is distributed among the four possible complexes and the free Co^2+ ion.

Wait, no. The total Co includes all species: free Co^2+ and all the complexes. So the sum of all [Co] species is 1e-2 M.

So the approach is to calculate the fraction of each species and then sum them up. Then, the fraction of the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ will give the percentage.

But considering that the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M, which is a bit high. The formation of complexes depends on the concentration of SCN- as well.

The general approach would be to model each complex's formation and calculate their concentrations.

But considering that the number of species is four complexes plus the free ion, the calculations could get a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of successive approximations or the method of stability constants to find the dominant species.

Alternatively, the problem can be approached using the fraction of each species, considering the overall formation constants.

The overall formation constant for each complex is:

β1 = 9 → [CoSCN]^2+.

β1β2 = 9*40=360 → [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

β1β2β3= 9*40*63=25200 → [Co(SCN)3]^2+.

β1β2β3β4= 9*40*63*16= 362880 → [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if the concentration of SCN- affects the overall β. Let me think. The formation constants are given, and each β is for a stepwise addition.

Wait, the formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the order of K is:

K1=9,

K2=360,

K3=25200,

K4=362880.

So the strength of the complexes increases with n, meaning higher tendency to form complexes with more SCN-.

But the concentration of SCN- is 0.1 M. So even though the K for the higher n is larger, if the concentration of SCN- is low, maybe the higher complexes aren't that prevalent.

Wait, but 0.1 M is actually quite a high concentration. Let me think: when [SCN-] is higher, more complexes will form, especially the higher n ones.

But let's think about the distribution of the species. The fraction of each species can be found using the formation constants and the SCN- concentration.

The formula for the fraction f_n of the nth complex is:

f_n = (K_n [Co^2+]) / ( [SCN-]^n + K_1 [SCN-]^{n-1} + K_1 K_2 [SCN-]^{n-2} + ... + K_1 K_2 ... K_{n} } )

Wait, perhaps that's getting complicated. Alternatively, each species' concentration can be found using the formation constants and the concentration of SCN-.

Wait, another approach is to consider the distribution of Co species based on the stability constants and the ligand concentration.

The general method is to compute the fraction of each complex as follows:

For each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+,

the fraction f_n is equal to (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n) / ( [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n + sum_{m=1 to n} (K_m [SCN-]^m) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation of each complex step by step.

But perhaps a better way is to model each species and find their concentrations.

Let me denote:

[Co^2+] = C,

[SCN-] = 0.1 M,

The total Co is 1e-2 M, so:

C + [CoSCN]^2+ + [Co(SCN)2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^2+ + [Co(SCN)4]^2+ = 1e-2 M.

But wait, actually, the total Co is the sum of all the species: free Co^2+ and all the complexes.

But the complexes are [CoSCN]^2+, [Co(SCN)2]^2+, [Co(SCN)3]^2+, and [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

So,

C + [CoSCN]^2+ + [Co(SCN)2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^2+ + [Co(SCN)4]^2+ = 1e-2.

Each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of C and the formation constants.

The formation of each complex is as follows:

1. Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^2+; K1 =9.

So [CoSCN]^2+ = K1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-] / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] )

Wait, no, actually, the formation of each complex is a stepwise process. But perhaps it's easier to model the entire distribution using the cumulative formation constants.

Wait, a better approach is to model the distribution by considering the cumulative formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The fraction of each species can be found using the formula:

f_n = (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n + sum_{m=1}^n K_m [SCN^-]^{m} ) )

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, the fraction of each complex [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is given by:

f_n = (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n + sum_{m=1}^n (K_m [SCN^-]^m ) ) )

But I'm not sure. Maybe the denominator is the sum of all possible terms, including the free ion.

Alternatively, the fraction can be calculated as:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^n (K_m [SCN^-]^m ) )

Wait, but wait, K_0 is 1 (since it's the free ion, [Co^2+] = K_0 [Co^2+] ... no, perhaps not. Wait, alternative approach: the fraction of the nth complex is given by (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + K_1 [SCN^-] + K_1 K_2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + K_1 K_2 K_3 K_4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Wait, no, perhaps the cumulative product for each term.

Hmm, perhaps an easier way is to use the formula for the distribution of metal complexes. The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + K_1 [SCN^-] + K_1 K_2 [SCN^-]^2 + K_1 K_2 K_3 [SCN^-]^3 + K_1 K_2 K_3 K_4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Where K_1 is the overall formation constant for the first complex, K_2 for the second, etc. Wait, but in our case, K_1 is β1=9, K_2=β1*β2=360, etc.

Wait, actually, no. Because each β is the stepwise constant. So K_n is the cumulative product up to βn.

So for [Co(SCN)_n]^2+, the overall K is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

So the fractions would be:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN^-]^m) )

Where K_0 is 1 (free Co^2+), K_1 = β1, K_2=β1β2, K_3=β1β2β3, K_4=β1β2β3β4.

Wait, but wait, the denominator would be the sum of all possible K_m [SCN^-]^m from m=0 to 4.

So let me compute each K_m:

K_0 = 1 (free Co^2+)

K_1 = β1 =9

K_2 = β1*β2=9 *40=360

K_3=β1β2β3=9*40*63=25200

K_4=β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16= let's compute that.

Compute step by step:

9 *40= 360.

360 *63= 22680.

22680 *16= 362880.

So K_4=362880.

Now, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So the denominator is sum_{m=0 to4} (K_m * (0.1)^m )

Compute each term:

m=0: 1*(0.1)^0 =1*1=1.

m=1:9*(0.1)^1=9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2:360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3:25200*(0.1)^3=25200 * 0.001=25.2.

m=4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

Now sum all these:

1 + 0.9=1.9

+3.6=5.5

+25.2=30.7

+36.288=66.988.

So denominator is approximately 66.988.

Now, the numerator for each f_n is K_n * (0.1)^n.

Wait, but wait, the f_n is (K_n [SCN^-]^n) / denominator.

So compute each f_n:

f_0 = (1 * (0.1)^0 ) / 66.988 =1/66.988 ≈0.01493 =1.493%.

f_1 = (9 * (0.1)^1 ) /66.988 = (0.9)/66.988≈0.01342≈1.342%.

f_2= (360 * (0.1)^2 ) /66.988 = (3.6)/66.988≈0.0537≈5.37%.

f_3= (25200 * (0.1)^3 ) /66.988 =25.2 /66.988≈0.3756≈37.56%.

f_4= (362880 * (0.1)^4 ) /66.988=36.288 /66.988≈0.5415≈54.15%.

Wait, but wait a second, the sum of all f_n should be 100%. Let me check:

1.493 +1.342=2.835

+5.37=8.205

+37.56=45.765

+54.15=99.915. Hmm, about 99.9%, which is close to 100%, so minor discrepancy due to rounding.

So the fractions are:

f0=1.493%,

f1=1.342%,

f2=5.37%,

f3=37.56%,

f4=54.15%.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

So that's f2=5.37%.

Wait, but wait, the options given don't include 5.37%.

The options are:

A) 42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%.

Hmm, none of these match 5.37%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Perhaps the question refers to the blue color as the tetra complex? Or maybe I messed up the formation constants.

Wait, let's go back. The blue complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2+? Or perhaps the problem refers to [Co(SCN)4]^2+ as blue? Or perhaps I messed up the problem statement.

Wait, the question says: "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Dithiocyanato means two SCN ligands. So the complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2+. So f2 is the fraction that corresponds to this species.

But according to my calculation, f2 is about 5.37%. But the options don't have that.

So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem considers all possible Co species, including any other possible oxidation states, but the question states that it's Co(II), so that's not it.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the fractions are calculated differently, considering that the total concentration is 1e-2 M, not just 1 M.

Wait, in the previous approach, I considered the fractions without considering the actual concentration of Co. But perhaps I should include the total concentration.

Wait, the formula I used earlier might have been incorrect. Let me think again.

The correct method to find the concentration of each complex is:

Each [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + sum_{m=1}^n K_m [SCN^-]^m )

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula is:

[Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = ( K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / ( [Co^2+] + sum_{m=1}^4 ( K_m [SCN^-]^m ) )

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let's think in terms of the formation of each complex.

The free Co^2+ is C.

The concentration of [CoSCN]^2+ is:

K1 * C * [SCN^-] = 9 * C * 0.1.

Similarly, [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is:

K1*K2 * C * [SCN^-]^2= 9*40 * C*(0.1)^2 = 360 * C * 0.01= 3.6 C.

Wait, but that's the concentration if you multiply K1*K2, which is the overall constant for the second complex, and multiply by C and [SCN]^2.

Wait, but how about the other complexes? Each complex's concentration is determined by the product of all previous βs, multiplied by C and [SCN^-]^n.

Wait, let me denote the concentration of [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ as Cn.

So:

C0 = C (free Co^2+)

C1 = β1 * C * [SCN^-] =9 * C *0.1

C2= β1 β2 * C [SCN^-]^2 =9*40 * C * (0.1)^2=360 * C *0.01=3.6 C.

C3= β1 β2 β3 * C [SCN^-]^3= 9*40*63 * C * (0.1)^3= 25200 * C * 0.001=25.2 C.

C4= β1 β2 β3 β4 * C [SCN^-]^4=9*40*63*16 *C * (0.1)^4= 362880 * C * 0.0001=36.288 C.

Wait, but the total Co is C + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 = 1e-2 M.

So:

C + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 =1e-2.

Substituting each Ci:

C + (9*0.1 C) + (360*0.01 C) + (25200*0.001 C) + (362880 *0.0001 C) =1e-2.

Compute each term:

C = C.

9*0.1 =0.9 → 0.9 C.

360*0.01=3.6 →3.6 C.

25200 *0.001=25.2 →25.2 C.

362880 *0.0001=36.288 →36.288 C.

So sum:

C + 0.9 C +3.6 C +25.2 C +36.288 C = (1 +0.9 +3.6 +25.2 +36.288 ) C.

Adding the coefficients:

1 +0.9 =1.9

+3.6 =5.5

+25.2=30.7

+36.288=66.988.

So 66.988 C =1e-2 → C =1e-2 /66.988 ≈0.0001493 M.

So C ≈1.493e-4 M.

Then, the concentration of each complex is:

C1=0.9 C ≈0.9 *1.493e-4 ≈1.343e-4 M.

C2=3.6 C≈3.6 *1.493e-4≈5.375e-4 M.

C3=25.2 C≈25.2 *1.493e-4≈3.758e-3 M.

C4=36.288 C≈36.288 *1.493e-4≈5.415e-3 M.

So the concentrations are:

C0=1.493e-4,

C1=1.343e-4,

C2=5.375e-4,

C3=3.758e-3,

C4=5.415e-3.

Now, the question is what's the percentage of C2 among all the Co species.

So percentage = (C2 / total ) *100.

But the total is 1e-2 M, so:

percentage = (C2 / (1e-2 )) *100 = (5.375e-4 / 1e-2 ) *100.

5.375e-4 is 0.0005375.

0.0005375 /0.01 =0.05375 →5.375%.

Again, about 5.375%, which doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm, that's perplexing. So either my approach is wrong, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the percentage of the blue complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

But according to this, it's about 5.375%, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the dithiocyanato as n=2. What if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)4]^2+? Let's check.

Wait, no, [Co(SCN)4]^2+ would be tetra, and the question says dithiocyanato, which is two.

Alternatively, perhaps the β4 is for the fourth step, but perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+ instead of 2+. No, the problem states "cobalt(II)" ions, so charge would be +2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are for [Co(SCN)_n]^3+ instead of ^2+? Because I remember that some Co complexes are +3. But the question says Co(II) ions, so the charge is +2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the log of the stability constants? No, the β values given are just numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently, using the fraction of each species considering the overall formation constants.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each species can be calculated by considering the relative contributions of each possible complex. The species with the highest K (β) and sufficient [SCN^-] will dominate.

But in this case, K4 is the largest (362880), but the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. Let me compute the contribution of each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the logarithmic approach, considering the relative stability.

But perhaps I should compute the ratio of concentrations for each species.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is looking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex among all possible Co species, but in the denominator, perhaps the sum of all complexes except the free ion.

Wait, but the denominator in the earlier approach included the free ion, so that's the correct way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the distribution of the different complexes based on the concentration of the ligand and the stability constants.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the stepwise approach, where each β is the cumulative constant, not the stepwise. That would change the calculation.

Wait, if β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^2+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^2+, etc., then the approach is different.

In that case, the K would be the same as each β. So K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because K3 should be larger than K2 if more complexes form. So if K4 is 16, which is less than K2=40, that would imply that the tetra complex is less stable than the di complex, which is unlikely.

So that probably isn't the case. So the βs are stepwise.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the form of the fraction.

The fraction of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is:

f2 = ( [Co(SCN)2]^2+ ) / ( [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^2+ + [Co(SCN)2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^2+ + [Co(SCN)4]^2+ )

Which is:

f2 = (β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 ) / ( [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4 )

We can factor out [Co^2+] in denominator:

f2 = (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 ) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Substituting the given values:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN^-]=0.1 M.

So:

Numerator: 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6.

Denominator:

1 +

9 *0.1 =0.9 →

+ (9*40) *(0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6 → 0.9+3.6=4.5.

+ (9*40*63) *(0.1)^3= 25200 *0.001=25.2 →4.5+25.2=29.7.

+ (9*40*63*16) * (0.1)^4= 362880 *0.0001=36.288 →29.7+36.288=65.988.

So denominator is 65.988.

Thus, f2=3.6 /65.988 ≈0.05455 or 5.455%.

Again, about 5.45%, which is not matching any option.

Hmm, the options all are much higher. So perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the βs are stepwise. Perhaps the βs are the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise.

Wait, let's try that approach.

Assume that K1=9 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^2+.

K2=40 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

K3=63 is for [Co(SCN)3]^2+.

K4=16 for [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

But that doesn't make sense because K3=63 is bigger than K2=40, which makes sense, but K4=16 is smaller than K3, which would mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is unusual. So perhaps this isn't the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β are the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. Let me try that.

Then, for each complex:

[CoSCN]^2+ has K1=9.

[Co(SCN)2]^2+ has K2=40.

[Co(SCN)3]^2+ has K3=63.

[Co(SCN)4]^2+ has K4=16.

Wait, but this would imply that the third complex is the most stable (K=63) and the fourth is less stable (K=16), which is not typical. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are the overall constants, and each step adds another SCN. So the formation constants for each complex are:

K1=9 for [CoSCN]^2+,

K2=40 for [Co(SCN)2]^2+,

K3=63 for [Co(SCN)3]^2+,

K4=16 for [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

But again, with K4=16 being lower than K3=63, that's odd.

Alternatively, perhaps the given β's are the logarithms of the formation constants. Wait, but no, the problem states 'stability constants' as β, which are usually K.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is about the concentration of each complex, and we should calculate the fraction based on the βs as the formation constants for each step, but perhaps the way I calculated the fractions earlier misses some terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... β4 [SCN^-]^4 )

But that's what I did earlier, leading to f2=5.37%.

Hmm.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think again: perhaps I should compute the concentration of each complex and then compute their percentages.

Let me try that.

Given:

Total Co: 0.01 M.

[SCN^-] =0.1 M.

Each step:

Co^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [CoSCN]^2+; K1=9.

[CoSCN]^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)2]^2+; K2=40.

[Co(SCN)2]^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)3]^2+; K3=63.

[Co(SCN)3]^2+ + SCN^- ⇌ [Co(SCN)4]^2+; K4=16.

The formation constants are stepwise.

So, the overall K for each complex is:

K1=9,

K2=K1*K2=9*40=360,

K3=K2*K3=360*63=22680,

K4=K3*K4=22680*16=362880.

Now, the concentration of each complex is given by:

[CoSCN]^2+ = K1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-] / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Similarly for [Co(SCN)2]^2+,

[Co(SCN)2]^2+ = K2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 / denominator,

Denominator is 1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4.

So let's compute the denominator:

Compute each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1: K1 [SCN^-] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: K2 [SCN^-]^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

Term3: K3 [SCN^-]^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

Term4: K4 [SCN^-]^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum all terms: 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator=64.468.

Now, compute each concentration:

[Co^2+] = C,

[CoSCN]^2+ = (9 * C *0.1) /64.468 = (0.9 C) /64.468 ≈0.01397 C.

[Co(SCN)2]^2+ = (360 * C *0.01 ) /64.468 =3.6 C /64.468≈0.05553 C.

[Co(SCN)3]^2+ = (22680 * C *0.001 ) /64.468=22.68 C /64.468≈0.3518 C.

[Co(SCN)4]^2+ = (362880 * C *0.0001 ) /64.468=36.288 C /64.468≈0.5628 C.

So the concentrations are:

C,

0.01397 C,

0.05553 C,

0.3518 C,

0.5628 C.

Now, the total concentration is C + 0.01397 C +0.05553 C +0.3518 C +0.5628 C = 

Compute:

C*(1 +0.01397 +0.05553 +0.3518 +0.5628) = C*(1 +0.01397=1.01397 +0.05553=1.0695 +0.3518=1.4213 +0.5628=1.9841 → sum is ~1.9841.

But the total Co is 0.01 M:

1.9841 * C =0.01 → C=0.01 /1.9841≈0.005034 M.

So C≈0.005034 M.

Now, compute each concentration:

[Co^2+] =0.005034 M.

[CoSCN]^2+ =0.01397 *0.005034≈0.0000699 M.

[Co(SCN)2]^2+ =0.05553 *0.005034≈0.0002796 M.

[Co(SCN)3]^2+ =0.3518 *0.005034≈0.001771 M.

[Co(SCN)4]^2+ =0.5628 *0.005034≈0.002831 M.

Now, the total is 0.005034 +0.0000699 +0.0002796 +0.001771 +0.002831≈0.009975, which is close to 0.01 M, considering rounding.

Now, the percentage of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is (0.0002796 /0.01 ) *100 =2.796%.

Still, about 2.8%, which doesn't match any of the options.

Hmm, I'm getting more confused. Perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of the fraction of each complex.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the logarithm of the stability constants. No, the β values are given as numbers, not log K.

Alternatively, perhaps the formation constants are given as log β, but that would change the approach a lot. Let me check.

If β1=9 is log K1, then K1=10^9, which is extremely large. That can't be right. So probably, β is K.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the formation constants. No, that would invert the K, leading to more free ions, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the stepwise formation constants as β1, β2, etc., but the overall K is the product up to that step. So the approach was correct, and the answer is about 5.37%, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought K2 is K1*K2, but perhaps each term is K1, K1K2, etc.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck because none of my approaches are matching the options. Maybe I should try to compute the ratios differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the fraction of each species can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (K_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K1 K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K1 K2 K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K1 K2 K3 K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So, f2 would be (K2 [SCN^-]^2) / denominator.

K2=360, [SCN]=0.1.

So numerator=360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6.

Denominator=1 +9*0.1 +360*(0.1)^2 +25200*(0.1)^3 +362880*(0.1)^4.

As computed earlier, denominator=66.988.

So f2=3.6 /66.988≈5.37%.

Again, same result.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is 5.37%, which is not among the options. But the options given are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

So I must have made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which includes both [Co(SCN)2]^2+ and other complexes with two SCN. No, that's not possible because each complex has a certain number of SCN.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that each β is the logarithm of the formation constant. Wait, if β is log K, then K=10^β.

So let's see:

If β1=9 → K1=1e9.

β2=40 → K2=1e40.

β3=63 → K3=1e63.

β4=16 → K4=1e16.

But that would make the K values extremely large, leading to almost all Co being in the highest complex, but the [SCN] is 0.1 M. Let me think.

But with K4=1e16, and [SCN]=0.1, the term for [Co(SCN)4]^2+ would be K4*[SCN]^4=1e16 * (0.1)^4=1e16 * 1e-4=1e12. Which would dominate the denominator, making the fraction of the tetra complex almost 100%. But the options don't have that.

So probably, β is not log K.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the concentration of ligand as 0.1 M, but the formation constants are given in terms of the reciprocal.

No, that would complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct fraction is 37.56%, which is for [Co(SCN)3]^2+.

But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

Alternatively, perhaps the β values are given as β1=9 (for [CoSCN]^+ ), but that would change the charge, which the problem says is Co(II), so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all complexes that have exactly two SCN- ligands, which in this case is the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ complex. So my initial calculation gives about 5.37%, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the denesting of the fractions, or perhaps I made a mistake in computing the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be 1 + K1 [SCN] + K1 K2 [SCN]^2 + K1 K2 K3 [SCN]^3 + K1 K2 K3 K4 [SCN]^4.

Which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the formation constants in the denominator.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fractions using the formula where each term is K_n [SCN]^n, but I've done that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 38.1%, which is option C. How? Because 37.56% is close to 38%, and perhaps due to rounding.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, f3=37.56%, which is the fraction of [Co(SCN)3]^2+. But the question is about [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

Hmm, I'm at a loss. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula where the fraction is (βn [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which is what I did.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the distribution of the metal among the different complexes, considering that each complex's concentration is (K_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n) / denominator.

But that's what I've done.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer is 5.37%, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the fraction using the following formula:

The fraction of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is:

f2 = ( [Co(SCN)2]^2+ ) / ( [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^2+ + [Co(SCN)2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)3]^2+ + [Co(SCN)4]^2+ )

Which can be rewritten as:

f2 = ( [Co(SCN)2]^2+ ) / ( [Co^2+] + sum_{n=1 to4} [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ )

But [Co(SCN)_n]^2+ = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So:

f2 = ( K2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 ) / ( [Co^2+] + K1 [Co^2+] [SCN^-] + K2 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^4 )

Factor [Co^2+] out:

f2 = K2 [SCN^-]^2 / ( 1 + K1 [SCN^-] + K2 [SCN^-]^2 + K3 [SCN^-]^3 + K4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Which is the same as before.

So f2=3.6 /66.988≈5.37%.

Hmm.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps I should re-express the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which includes any complex with two SCN, but in reality, each complex has a specific number of SCN. So no, it's just [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the sum of all possible species, including the free ion, but I don't think that changes the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the β values. Let me check the β4 value again.

The β4 is given as 16. So when n=4, K4=β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Wait, but perhaps the β4 is for the third step? No, the description says β4 is the fourth stability constant.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to swap β3 and β4. Let me check. If β3=16 and β4=63, that would change things.

But the problem states β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So that can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the fractions are calculated, and I should use the formula where f_n = ( K_n [SCN]^n ) / ( sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN]^m ), where K_0=1.

Which is what I did earlier.

But in that case, f2=5.37%.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the formation constants.

No, that would invert K, which doesn't make sense because higher K means more stable.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the ratio of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ to the sum of all species except the free ion.

In that case, the denominator would be sum of [CoSCN]^2+ to [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

So, if I compute the sum of C1 to C4, and then compute C2/(C1+C2+C3+C4), perhaps that's what the question is asking.

In my earlier calculation:

C1=1.343e-4,

C2=5.375e-4,

C3=3.758e-3,

C4=5.415e-3.

Sum =1.343e-4 +5.375e-4=6.718e-4 +3.758e-3=4.4298e-3 +5.415e-3=9.8448e-3.

So C2=5.375e-4.

So percentage = (5.375e-4 /9.8448e-3 ) *100 ≈5.46%.

Still about 5.46%.

Hmm, but this also doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the free Co^2+ as part of the denominator, but I'm not seeing that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage among all complexes, not including the free ion.

So, the sum of all complexes is 9.8448e-3, as above. And C2 is 5.375e-4.

So percentage = (5.375e-4 / 9.8448e-3 ) *100 ≈5.46%.

Still about 5.46%.

Hmm.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula where each fraction is calculated as (β1β2...βn ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4 )

Which would be f_n = K_n / denominator.

So for [Co(SCN)2]^2+, f2= K2 / denominator.

K2=360,

Denominator=1 +9*0.1 +360*0.01 +25200*0.001 +362880*0.0001=1+0.9+3.6+25.2+36.288=66.988.

So f2=360/66.988≈5.37%.

Wait, same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the complex [Co(SCN)4]^2+ as the blue one. Let's check.

If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)4]^2+,

f4=362880 *0.1^4 / denominator.

Wait, no, denominator is 66.988.

So f4= (362880 * 0.0001 ) /66.988=36.288/66.988≈0.5415 →54.15%. None of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the dissociation of the complexes, but that complicates things further.

I'm stuck. I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the only answer I can get is about 5.37%, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all species, including the free ion, but I don't think that changes anything.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + β1 * [SCN] + β1β2 [SCN]^2 + β1β2β3 [SCN]^3 + β1β2β3β4 [SCN]^4.

Which is:

1 +9*(0.1) + (9*40)*(0.1)^2 + (9*40*63)*(0.1)^3 + (9*40*63*16)*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

β1*[SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

β1β2*[SCN]^2=9*40=360; 360*(0.1)^2=3.6.

β1β2β3*[SCN]^3=9*40*63=25200; 25200*(0.1)^3=25200*0.001=25.2.

β1β2β3β4 *[SCN]^4=9*40*63*16=362880; 362880*(0.1)^4=362880*0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +25.2=30.7 +36.288=66.988.

Yes, denominator is correct.

So, f2=3.6 /66.988≈5.37%.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the first four terms, not including the free ion. So the denominator is sum from m=1 to4.

Denominator=0.9+3.6+25.2+36.288=65.988.

Then f2=3.6 /65.988≈5.45%.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex relative to all possible complexes, including higher ones. But that would still give around 5%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, but I incorrectly used 0.1 in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, correct.

Hmm.

At this point, perhaps the intended answer is option C)38.1%, which is close to the fraction of the third complex, [Co(SCN)3]^2+.

But why would the question ask about the dithiocyanato complex?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read it.

The question says: "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species in the solution."

Wait, perhaps dithiocyanato doesn't mean two SCN but four SCN. No, dithiocyanato is two. Or perhaps I'm wrong about the color.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^2+, and the question is a trick question.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the assumption that the free Co^2+ is negligible, so the denominator is approximately the sum of the complexes.

But in that case, the sum of the complexes is about 9.84e-3, and the [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is 5.375e-4. So the percentage is 5.46%.

Still not matching.

Hmm.

I'm really stuck here. I think the correct answer based on calculations is about 5.37%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C)38.1%, which is the percentage of [Co(SCN)3]^2+.

But the question is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended to refer to the tetra complex as blue. Let me check the color of Co complexes.

Upon a quick search in memory, I recall that [Co(SCN)6]^3+ is blood-red, and [Co(SCN)4]^2+ is blue. So perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

So, the question is about [Co(SCN)4]^2+.

Then, f4=36.288 /66.988≈54.15%, which isn't an option.

But option A is42.3%, which is roughly the sum of f3 and f4 (37.56%+54.15%=91.71%→ no, not matching).

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the blue complex, which is [Co(SCN)4]^2+, but the answer is 54%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about [Co(SCN)3]^2+ being blue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is 5.37%, but that's not among the options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex among all possible species, including the free ion, but I don't think that would change the percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations again.

Wait, perhaps the concentration of [Co(SCN)2]^2+ is 5.37% of the total Co, which is 1e-2 M.

So, 5.37% of 0.01 M is 0.000537 M, which is 5.37e-4 M.

But the options are percentages, so the answer should be 5.37%.

Hmm.

Since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the inverse of the formation constants. For example, using 1/β instead.

But that would make the fractions much smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the inverse approach, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the logarithm of the concentrations.

Wait, I'm out of ideas. I think I've tried all possible approaches, and the correct answer based on calculations is approximately 5.37%, but since that's not an option, I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the complex [Co(SCN)2]^+ instead of ^2+, but that would imply Co(III), which contradicts the Co(II) statement.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option C)38.1%, but I can't see how it fits with the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)38.1%, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves determining the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in a solution. The solution contains Co²⁺ ions and thiocyanate (SCN⁻) with concentrations of 10⁻² M and 0.1 M, respectively. The stability constants (β₁, β₂, β₃, β₄) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16, respectively.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:
   - The stability constants (β) are stepwise formation constants. The overall stability constant for each complex is the product of the stepwise constants:
     - K₁ = β₁ = 9
     - K₂ = β₁β₂ = 9 × 40 = 360
     - K₃ = β₁β₂β₃ = 9 × 40 × 63 = 25,200
     - K₄ = β₁β₂β₃β₄ = 9 × 40 × 63 × 16 = 362,880

2. **Fraction of Each Complex**:
   - The fraction of each complex is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     f_n = \frac{K_n [\text{SCN}^-]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}^-] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}^-]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}^-]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}^-]^4}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     - Denominator = \(1 + 9(0.1) + 360(0.1)^2 + 25,200(0.1)^3 + 362,880(0.1)^4 = 66.988\)
     - Numerator for \(f_2\) (blue dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺):
       \[
       f_2 = \frac{360 \times (0.1)^2}{66.988} = \frac{3.6}{66.988} \approx 0.0537 \, \text{or} \, 5.37\%
       \]

3. **Mismatch with Options**:
   - The calculated percentage for [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ is approximately 5.37%, which does not match any of the provided options (A: 42.3%, B: 25.6%, C: 38.1%, D: 16.9%).

4. **Revisiting the Blue Complex**:
   - The problem specifies the "blue dithiocyanato" complex, which corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺. However, the calculated percentage does not align with the options. This suggests either:
     - A misunderstanding of the problem's reference to the "blue" complex (e.g., if the blue complex were [Co(SCN)₄]²⁺ or another species).
     - An error in interpreting the stability constants or the formation process.

5. **Final Consideration**:
   - Based on the calculations, the percentage of [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ is approximately 5.37%. However, since this value is not among the options, the closest plausible answer is **C) 38.1%**, which corresponds to the fraction of [Co(SCN)₃]²⁺. This discrepancy suggests either an issue with the problem's framing or a misinterpretation of the "blue" complex.

### Conclusion:
The calculated percentage for the blue dithiocyanato complex [Co(SCN)₂]²⁺ is approximately 5.37%, but since this is not an option, the most reasonable choice based on the given options is **C) 38.1%**, assuming the problem refers to a different species as the "blue" complex.

ANSWER: C
