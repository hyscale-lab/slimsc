Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question involves some chemical reactions and mixtures. Let me read the problem again carefully.

We have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heat, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, both X and Y, when hydrogenated with Pt under severe conditions, give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass and is part of Y. Also, Z is widely used as a solvent.

Moreover, the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me jot down the key points:

1. Mixture X (two liquids) → decolorizes bromine water. So, X contains compounds with double bonds, since bromine reacts with alkenes or alkynes (but the latter might be less common in such reactions). Also, since it's a mixture, the two liquids are different compounds, each with double bonds.

2. X is treated with Pt and heat → undergoes disproportionation to form Y. Since it's a disproportionation, one species is being both oxidized and reduced. For example, in the case of alkenes, perhaps adding H2 across the double bond and some other reaction. Wait, but wait, the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y's compounds don't have double bonds, which suggests that the double bonds in X have been hydrogenated in Y.

Wait, but X and Y both are treated with H2 under Pt, and give Z. So, when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, and same for Y. So, the initial X has two different compounds which upon hydrogenation give Z. Similarly, Y's two compounds upon hydrogenation also give Z.

Wait, but Y is formed via a disproportionation of X. So, perhaps the two compounds in X are such that upon reaction with Pt and heat, they transform in a way that some are hydrogenated, and others perhaps dehydrogenated? Or maybe, considering the reaction conditions, it's a hydrogenation and something else. Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation. Disproportionation is when a single element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. But in this context, perhaps it's a reaction where some bonds break and others form, leading to different products. Alternatively, maybe the two components of X are reacting with each other under these conditions.

Wait, maybe the two components in X are such that one is a diene and the other is something else. Or perhaps, each component is a di-substituted alkene, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about the hydrogenation part. Both X and Y when hydrogenated give Z. So, Z is a hydrocarbon, and since both X and Y give Z upon hydrogenation, perhaps the components of X and Y are related through the hydrogenation process.

Wait, maybe the components of X are alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form Z. But since X is a mixture, perhaps each component is a di-substituted alkene, and their hydrogenation gives Z. Or perhaps the two components in X are such that their hydrogenation leads to the same product Z.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is hydrogenated, it gives only Z. So each component in X, when hydrogenated, gives Z. So X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation yields Z. Similarly, Y is also a mixture of two compounds that upon hydrogenation give Z.

Wait, so X is a mixture of two alkenes (or alkynes, but alkenes are more likely for bromine water decolorization). Each of these alkenes, upon hydrogenation, gives Z. Similarly, Y's components, upon hydrogenation, give Z.

But then, Y is formed via a
