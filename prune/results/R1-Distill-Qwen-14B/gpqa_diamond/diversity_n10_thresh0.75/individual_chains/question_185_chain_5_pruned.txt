Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let's see. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So each component σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. And n is a unit vector, meaning it's in some arbitrary direction.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. So the operator H should also be a 2x2 matrix. Now, eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(H - λI) = 0. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than actually computing this for a general n.

Oh right! The Pauli matrices have a specific property. Each Pauli matrix, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, has eigenvalues ±1. Also, when you take a dot product like σ · n, where n is a unit vector, that's equivalent to the sum of each σ_i multiplied by n_i, since n is a unit vector, the sum of n_i squared is 1.

Wait, another thought. The operator σ · n is a spin operator in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of such an operator should be ±1, because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1 and the operator is a combination that's normalized. Or wait, does it have eigenvalues
