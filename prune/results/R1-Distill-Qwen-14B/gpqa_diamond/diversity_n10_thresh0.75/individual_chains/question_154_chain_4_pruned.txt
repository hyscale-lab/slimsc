Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let's break it down step by step.

First, looking at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest peak at 100% abundance. Then there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% abundance. Hmm, molecular weight of 156 is a key point. What could that correspond to? Maybe a compound with a molecular formula that adds up to 156 g/mol.

The IR spectrum shows a broad peak between 3500 and 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate either an O-H stretch (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or maybe an N-H, but since this is a white solid, maybe it's a carboxylic acid because those are often solids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a carboxylic acid, ester, ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an acid chloride. But carboxylic acids typically have O-H stretches that are broad, which matches the IR data here.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm integrating for 1H. That's a really high chemical shift, which makes me think of a carboxylic acid proton. Because in NMR, the -COOH proton usually appears around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak, but here it's a singlet, which suggests maybe it's not exchanging rapidly or it's part of a more structured environment. Wait, but in carboxylic acids, the O-H is usually a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding. However, here it's a singlet, maybe indicating something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton? No, aromatic protons are lower. Wait, another thoughtâ€”could it be an acidic proton like in a phenol? Phenol protons are around 5-7 ppm, so 11 is higher than that. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to something else. Wait, 11 ppm is also where aldehyde protons appear if they're de-shielded a lot, but I think aldehydes are usually around 9-10. Maybe it's more like a carboxylic acid, but the peak is a singlet. Wait, maybe it's not a proton but an exchangeable group. Or perhaps it's a different functional group.

Wait, looking back at the options, the possible compounds are:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde
B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid
C) Phenyl chloroformate
D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid

Thinking about the NMR: the 11.0 ppm singlet, maybe that's a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde proton in option A. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the NMR signals.

In the 1H NMR, we have a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), which could be a carbonyl or an aldehyde. Then, there's a doublet at 8.02 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.72 ppm (2H). Those are likely aromatic protons. The doublets suggest that the two sets of protons are adjacent to substituents. Looking at the options, for example, benzoic acids would have substituents on the benzene ring.

Let's consider option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure would be a benzene ring with a Cl at position 4 and a COOH group at position 1 (since benzoic acid is at position 1). In that case, the ring would have two sets of protons: the two protons ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) and the two para to Cl (positions 3 and 5?), but wait, I might be getting the positions mixed up.

Wait, let me sketch this out. Benzoic acid has COOH at position 1. So if it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, Cl is at position 4. So the ring substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The adjacent protons would be at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) and 3 and 5 (meta to Cl, but para to COOH? Or wait, wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the positions are 1 (COOH), 4 (Cl). So the ring positions would be:

Positions 1: COOH
Position 4: Cl

So the ortho positions to COOH are 2 and 6. Those protons would be deshielded and appear downfield. The meta positions relative to Cl would be 3 and 5. So the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, but wait, in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, so the ring is:

1 (COOH)
2,6: ortho
3,5: meta
4: Cl.

So the H in position 2 would be ortho to COOH, and meta to Cl. Similarly
