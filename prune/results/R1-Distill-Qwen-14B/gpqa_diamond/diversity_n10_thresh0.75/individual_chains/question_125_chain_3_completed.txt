Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which I remember is the form for a harmonic oscillator. The particle's mass is m, and ω is the angular frequency. The problem is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy.

Hmm, right. In quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. I think the energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, wait—since it's isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of the three quantum numbers. Oh wait, no, in the 3D case, the energy levels are given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But wait, another approach: sometimes it's treated in terms of the principal quantum number n, where E = (n + 3/2) ħω. But wait, wait—no, that might not be accurate because in 3D, each direction is a 1D oscillator, so the total energy is the sum of the energies in each direction.

Wait, I think the correct formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z, each of which is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...). So each possible combination of n_x, n_y, n_z that adds up to a particular number will correspond to the same energy level.

So the states are degenerate, meaning different combinations can have the same energy. The degeneracy (number of eigenfunctions) for a given energy depends on how many ways you can write the sum n_x + n_y + n_z = N, where N is some integer. But wait, wait a second—the third excited state... I need to figure out what the energy is for that.

Wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. Let me think: in the 3D isotropic case, the ground state is when n_x = n_y = n_z = 0, so the sum N = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the energy is (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω. Then, the first excited state would be when the sum N=1. But wait, no, the states are ordered by their energy. Each time N increases by 1, the energy increases by ħω.

Wait, but the energy levels are given by E = (N + 3/2) ħω, where N is the sum of the quantum numbers, right? So the ground state is N=0: (0 + 3/2) ħω. Then N=1: (1+3/2) ħω, and so on.

Wait, that can't be right because for each N, the number of states would be the number of ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = N. For N=0, it's only 1 way (0,0,0). For N=1, you can have (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), so 3 ways. So the degeneracy increases as N increases.

But the question is about the third excited state. Wait, I need to clarify: in quantum mechanics, the ground state is the lowest energy, and the excited states are each higher than that. So the first excited state is N=1, the second is N=2, and the third is N=3. So the third excited state has N=3 + ground state? Wait no, let me think again.

Wait, ground state is N=0: energy (3/2) ħω. First excited state is N=1, which has energy (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. Second excited state is N=2: energy (7/2) ħω. Third excited state is N=3: (9/2) ħω. So the energy is (9/2) ħω.

Wait, but some people might number the states differently. Let me make sure. The ground state is the first state, then the first excited is higher, etc. So the ground state is the zeroth excited state? Or is the ground state considered the first state? Hmm, I think the ground state is considered the lowest, and the first excited is the next one. So the third excited state would be the fourth state in terms of energy, but considering the way N works, each N level corresponds to a certain number of states.

Wait, no. The energy levels are ordered by N. So for N=0, it's the ground state. N=1 is the first excited. N=2 is the second excited, and N=3 is the third excited. So the third excited state has N=3.

So the energy would be (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the question.

Now for the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (eigenstates) at this energy. That is, the degeneracy of the N=3 state.

The degeneracy for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is (N + 2 choose 2) or (N + 2)(N + 1)/2? Wait, no. Wait, for a given N, the number of states is the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = N. That's a combinatorics problem.

I think the number of such solutions is (N + 3 -1 choose 3-1) )= (N+2 choose 2) which is (N+2)(N+1)/2. So for N=3, that's (3+2)(3+1)/2 = 5*4/2 =10. So there are 10 possible states with N=3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10. That matches our calculation.

Option C: (9/2) ħω, 3. No, because the degeneracy is 10.

So the correct option should be A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels of such a system are quantized and given by $E = (N + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega$, where $N = n_x + n_y + n_z$ is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of ways to distribute $N$ quanta among the three directions, which is determined by the combinatorial formula $\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N+2}{2} = \frac{(N+2)(N+1)}{2}$.

To determine the energy of the third excited state, we note that the ground state corresponds to $N=0$, the first excited state to $N=1$, the second excited state to $N=2$, and the third excited state to $N=3$. For $N=3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the degeneracy of the $N=3$ state is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{3+2}{2} = \frac{(3+2)(3+1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: Correct, as it matches both the energy $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$ and the degeneracy 10.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as the energy expression is unrelated to the problem.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it incorrectly states the degeneracy as 3 instead of 10.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as the energy expression is unrelated to the problem.

The correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
