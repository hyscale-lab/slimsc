Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal and finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, rhombohedral crystals... I think they're also called trigonal or something like that. Oh right, rhombohedral means all the edges are the same length, and all angles are equal, so in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are each 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the lattice parameter 'a', right? So a = 10 A here.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance d is calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor. The formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 (cos 2α + cos 2β + cos 2γ)/2 + ... ) ), but wait, no, that's not right. Oh wait, for a general rhombohedral system, the interplanar distance formula is a bit more involved.

Wait, I think the general formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (hk + kl + lh) cos(2θ) ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. Since
