Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should be straightforward.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Oh wait, dilution, right. So the concentration after dilution would change. Let me calculate that first.

The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L (since 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters) equals 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration is moles divided by volume: 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Got it, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid. The acetic acid has 0.001 moles initially. So NaOH needed would also be 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

But wait, the equivalence point for a weak acid and strong base is when the salt formed is the conjugate base of the weak acid. So the solution will contain sodium acetate. Sodium acetate dissociates completely, so the solution will be basic because acetate is a weak base.

To find the pH at equivalence, I'll need to calculate the concentration of acetate ions and then find the pH using the Kb. Let me think.

First, the total volume at equivalence is the initial volume of acetic acid (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³). So 50 cm³ or 0.05 L. The moles of acetate are 0.001, as all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, and Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. Wait, that seems really small. Hmm, so maybe the solution is only weakly basic?

Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me rec
