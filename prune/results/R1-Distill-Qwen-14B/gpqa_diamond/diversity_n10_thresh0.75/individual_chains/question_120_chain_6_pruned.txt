Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, particularly how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, let's start by recalling what parallax means. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to the distance to the star. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer to us, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Oh, probably in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant throughout the volume. So, if I imagine the universe as filled with stars at the same density everywhere, then the number of stars depends on the volume I'm looking at.

Now, the problem is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (Δplx) changes with plx. So, I need to find the relationship between the number of stars in a thin shell (defined by a specific parallax range) and the parallax value itself.

Let me think about the geometry here. Parallax plx is related to distance. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So distance d = 1/plx.

If I consider a thin shell at a distance d, with thickness dd, then the volume of that shell can be approximated. The volume element in spherical shells is 4πr² dr. So, the volume for distance d and thickness dd is 4πd² dd.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this shell would be the product of the volume and the number density of stars. Let's say the number density is n (stars per cubic parsec), then the number of stars N in the shell is N = n * 4πd² dd.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax (Δplx). So, I need to express this in terms of parallax plx, not distance. Since d = 1/plx, I can substitute that into the equation.

So, d = 1/plx → d² = 1/(plx)^2. Also, I need to express dd in terms of d plx. Let's find the relationship between dd and d plx. Since d = 1/plx, taking derivative on both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx). So, d(plx) = -plx² dd. Hmm, but I think I can rearrange this as dd = -d(plx)/(plx²). Since we're dealing with ranges, maybe the negative sign just indicates direction, but for magnitude, it should be positive. So, the thickness in distance is dd = d(plx)/(plx²).

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If I have a small change in parallax, Δplx, how does that relate to the change in distance Δd? Since d = 1/plx, Δd ≈ -1/(plx)^2 * Δplx. So, the change in distance is proportional to 1/(plx)^2 times the change in parallax. But when plx increases, d decreases, and vice versa.

But in terms of volume, the shell's volume is 4πd² dd. So, substituting d in terms of plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx²) * (Δplx / plx²) ) ? Wait, no, I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, the dd is the change in distance corresponding to a small change in parallax Δplx. From d = 1/plx, taking derivatives, dd = - (1/plx²) d(plx). So, for a small Δplx, dd ≈ -(1/plx²) Δplx. But since we're considering a positive range in parallax, perhaps we should take the absolute value, so dd = (Δplx)/(plx²).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me approach it differently. Since the number of stars in a
