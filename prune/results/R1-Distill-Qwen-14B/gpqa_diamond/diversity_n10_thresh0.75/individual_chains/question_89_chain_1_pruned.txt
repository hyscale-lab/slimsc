Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a very rigid molecule. The structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms in the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane framework.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C, giving a light yellow solid product 1. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reactions might occur here. But wait, it's dibromide—so perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to an elimination product. But with two bromines, maybe it's a double elimination, forming a diene or something similar.

Wait, but another thought: when vicinal dihalides (two adjacent halides) react with a strong base, they can eliminate to form alkenes. But in this case, the two bromines are on 1 and 3 positions, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's not a vicinal dihalide. So maybe the base is abstracting a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbocation, but then another elimination? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a more complex rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Wait, but the product is a solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around the range for an alcohol or possibly an ether. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, the IR at 1720 is probably a carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is an ketone? How does that happen from a dibromide?

Oh wait, wait. The reaction is with KOH, which is a strong base. When a dihalide reacts with a strong base, another possibility is that two elimination steps occur, each losing HBr. Since the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which is a dihalide on non-adjacent carbons. So each elimination would form a double bond. Wait, so maybe two elimination steps happen, each losing H
