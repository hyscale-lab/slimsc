Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's quite rigid. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

The first step is heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibrominated compounds are treated with bases, they usually undergo elimination reactions to form alkenes. Wait, but since this is a dibromide, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an alkene. So, the product here would be adamantane with a double bond between the 1 and 3 carbons, right? So that would form 1,3-adamantadiene. But wait, no, because in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on adjacent carbons if it's 1,2? Or wait, no, adamantane's structure... Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid, so the 1 and 3 positions are probably not adjacent. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure. Adamantane is like a four-fused cyclohexane rings. So positions 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons perhaps, or maybe on opposite sides. Wait, maybe it's 1 and 3 being across from each other. Oh, wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxy compound? Wait, no, KOH under high heat would more likely cause elimination. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would lose two HBr molecules and form a double bond. But wait, 1 and 3 positions are on the same face or opposite? So, when the two Brs are eliminated, would it form a trans or cis double bond? I'm not exactly sure, but the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, which might be an alk
