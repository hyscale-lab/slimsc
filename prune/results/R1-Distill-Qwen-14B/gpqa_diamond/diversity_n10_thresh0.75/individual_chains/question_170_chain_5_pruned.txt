Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific state. The state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula: <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-component of spin. Oh wait, right, σ_y is given in the problem as a matrix. Let me write that down.

So σ_y is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

The state vector ψ is given as (3i, 4). I think I should write this as a column vector. So ψ = [3i; 4]. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value involves the conjugate transpose (dagger) of the state, so ψ† would be the row vector [ -3i  4 ] because I take the complex conjugate of each component.

So the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by ψ. Let's compute each step.

Let me compute σ_y * ψ first. Let's break it down. The matrix σ_y is 2x2, and ψ is 2x1, so the product should be a 2x1 vector.

First row of σ_y * ψ:
(0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second row:
(i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0. Wait, since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y * ψ equals [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i 4 ], and we need to multiply this by the result of σ_y * ψ.

So ψ† * (σ_y ψ) = (-3i)(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let's compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². Because i squared is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term
