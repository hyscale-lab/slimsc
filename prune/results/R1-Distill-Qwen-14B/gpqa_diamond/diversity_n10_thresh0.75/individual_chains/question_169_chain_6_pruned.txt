Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I need to figure out how changing one of the emitted particles affects the energy spectrum of another particle. Hmm, let's break it down.

The original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So, two nucleons of type A decay into two B's and emit two E particles and two V particles. Then, in the variant, instead of emitting two V's, it emits one M, which is an exotic, massless particle. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

The question is about the energy spectrum of E in these two cases. In the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum with an endpoint Q. I remember that in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because of the energy distribution between the electron and the antineutrino.

Wait, so in beta decay, when a neutron converts into a proton, electron, and antineutrino, the electron's energy varies. The maximum energy (endpoint) is determined by the total available energy, which depends on the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei. But since the antineutrino carries away some energy, the electron's energy isn't fixed.

In the original problem, maybe it's a similar situation. The 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V decay. Since E and V are emitted, their energies are not fixed because they share the available energy. But for E's spectrum, the endpoint would be when all the possible energy is given to the E particles, but considering the other particles as well.

Now, changing to the variant: 2A → 2B + 2E + M. And M is massless. Wait, massless particles like photons carry energy and momentum but have zero rest mass. So in this case, M is emitted as a single particle, but it's massless. So how does this affect the energy distribution?

I think the key here is considering the conservation of energy and momentum. In the original case, when there are two V's, each V can have some energy, which would affect how much energy the E's can have. But when you replace two V's (maybe each with some mass) with one M (massless), the dynamics change.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the number of particles. The original decay emits 2E and 2V, so four particles. The variant emits 2E and 1M, so three particles. But in both cases, the number of E particles is the same, so the E particles are still emitted in pairs.

Hmm. So the original has 2E and 2V, which are both emitted. Since V may have some rest mass, each V carries away some energy and momentum. But in the variant, M is massless, so all its energy comes from the decay as pure kinetic energy, perhaps.

Wait, but how does the number of other particles affect the energy distribution? Let me think about energy and momentum conservation.

In the original case, the system emits four particles: two E and two V. So the energy and momentum are distributed among all four
