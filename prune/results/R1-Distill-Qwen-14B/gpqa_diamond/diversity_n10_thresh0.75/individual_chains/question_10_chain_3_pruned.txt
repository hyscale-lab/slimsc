Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So, the formula is density = mass/volume. And the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. Since all these planets are presumably similar in shape to Earth, their volumes would depend on their radii.

Wait, but the question gives mass and sometimes mentions radius or density. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is known. Earth's average density is about 5.5 g/cm³. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Option b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but the question says which has the highest density, and option b already states it's 5.5. That seems same as Earth, but wait, maybe I need to calculate it. Oh, wait, no, because the density is given. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Wait, but what's the point of mass here? If mass is 2 Earth masses and density is 5.5, then the volume would be mass/(density). So volume = 2M_e /5.5 g/cm³. But Earth's volume is M_e/(5.5). So this planet's volume is twice Earth's. But since volume scales with radius cubed, the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But the density is given as 5.5, same as Earth. So for this option, the density is 5.5. So same as a.

Wait, but the question is about highest density. So both a and b have 5.5.

Option c) A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm, same composition means same density, right? Because if it's made of the same materials, their density would be same. Because density is a function of composition. So if Earth's density is 5.5, then this planet's density is also 5.5. But wait, wait. Wait, mass increases but radius increases as well. Wait, no,
