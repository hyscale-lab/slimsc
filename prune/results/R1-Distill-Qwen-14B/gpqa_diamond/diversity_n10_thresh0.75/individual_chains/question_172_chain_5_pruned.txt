Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember from my studies that when we talk about the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere, it's related to the star's temperature. Oh right, it's about the Boltzmann distribution.

The problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation is higher in star_1. I think the excitation depends on the temperature because hotter stars have more energetic atoms.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to Boltzmann's constant, which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, that must be a clue. So the energy difference ΔE is k_B * T * some factor.

The Boltzmann distribution formula says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states is given by (n2/n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k_B T) ). Or wait, sometimes it's written as n_i / n_j = exp( (E_j - E_i)/(k_B T) ) when E_i < E_j.

In this problem, the excitation is twice as high in star_1. Let's define n as the number of excited atoms. So n1 = 2 * n2. Or wait, no, wait: the problem says the excitation level is twice as excited. So maybe the number of atoms in the higher energy level for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1_upper / n2_upper = 2.

Wait, but the energy difference is the same for both stars, right? Because it's the same energy levels in iron. So for each star, the ratio depends on their respective temperatures.

Let me write the ratio for each star.

For star 1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T1) )
For star 2: n2_upper / n2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k_B T2) )

But wait, the question says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1. Alternatively,
