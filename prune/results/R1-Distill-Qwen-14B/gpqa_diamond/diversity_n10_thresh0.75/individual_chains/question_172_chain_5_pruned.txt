Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's see. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh, right, and the photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I need to find the equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the stars.

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy states. Oh yeah, the formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

In this case, the energy levels have a difference ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, no, wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. So for the two stars, the ratio of excited atoms (n_i) to the lower level (n_j) would be given by that formula.

But wait, the question says that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star 2. So n1 (star 1) is twice n2 (star 2). So the ratio n1/n2 = 2. 

But wait, wait, the formula for each star would be n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So for each star, the ratio depends on their temperature.

Assuming that the g_i/g_j (statistical weights) are the same for both stars since they're comparing the same energy levels in the same element. So the ratios for each star are:

For star 1: n1 = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1))
For star 2: n2 = (g_i/g_j) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, but they're comparing n1 and n2. So n1/n2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents.
