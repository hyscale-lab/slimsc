Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through. 

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, what's regularization? I remember it's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”those are infinities that pop up in calculations, which don't make physical sense. Regularization introduces a temporary momentum cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you remove the cutoff later, hopefully getting a finite result.

So the question is about which theory doesn't need this because it doesn't have such divergences, or maybe because it's a different kind of theory that handles things differently.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's a classical theory, not quantum. In classical electromagnetism, do you have divergences? I think in Maxwell's equations, everything is smooth, but when you get into point charges or point masses, there can be issues like infinite self-energy or infinite forces. But regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So maybe in the classical theory, you don't need regularization because it's not formulated using perturbative expansions with divergences in loop integrals. So perhaps option D is the one that doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory.

Now the other options are quantum theories. Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) is a quantum field theory. I remember that QED has divergent loop diagrams, especially in calculations like the electron self-energy. These require renormalization, which is related to regularization. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It also has similar issues as QED with divergences, especially at high energies (like in deep inelastic scattering or in the formation of quark-gluon plasma). So QCD requires regularization as well. Wait, but isn't QCD asymptotically free? That might mean that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, making perturbative calculations possible without too much divergence. But I'm not sure if that eliminates the need for regularization entirely. I think you
