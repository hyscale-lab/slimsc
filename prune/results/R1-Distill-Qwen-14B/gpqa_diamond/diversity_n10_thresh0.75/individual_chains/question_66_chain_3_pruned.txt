Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators are organized by their dimensionality, like dimension 6, 7, etc. But all of these operators have to respect certain symmetries that the Standard Model itself respects, right?

So, what's each symmetry here about?

Lorentz symmetry: That's the symmetry of special relativity, meaning the laws of physics are the same for all observers regardless of their constant velocity relative to each other. Since the Standard Model respects Lorentz symmetry, SMEFT must too because it's an effective theory that incorporates the SM. So all operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry.

Poincare symmetry: Hmm, wait, Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. But wait, waitâ€”I think in the context of effective field theories, the Poincare symmetry is automatically respected because the operators are local. Because SMEFT is a field theory, it's built with local terms, so the operators are constructed in a way that respects translations. But I'm not so sure. Oh wait, in SMEFT, the operators are built from the SM fields and their derivatives, so they should respect Poincare symmetry as well. But wait, sometimes when you have higher-dimension operators, could they break Poincare? Probably not, because the operators are built using covariant derivatives and the fields transform appropriately. So I think Poincare symmetry is also required. So options 1 and 2 must be correct.

Wait no, wait. Wait, in the SMEFT framework, operators are constructed to be renormalizable, in a sense. But I'm a bit confused about whether Poincare is automatically maintained because the theory is Lorentz invariant. Since Poincare includes the Lorentz group plus translations. So if Lorentz symmetry holds, and the theory is in a Minkowski space (which it is, because we're talking about effective field theory in the same spacetime as the SM), then Poincare should hold as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are
