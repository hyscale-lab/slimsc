Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of the flux in two energy bands after that happens. Let's start by breaking down the problem.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton (pp) chain. The pp-III branch is one part of this chain. So, if it stops, that must affect neutrino production.

Wait, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I and pp-II are the main contributors, right? The pp-III is a minor branch, but it contributes to higher-energy neutrinos? Or maybe I'm mixing that up.

I think the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the other branches. Because the pp-III involves more energetic reactions, perhaps. So when pp-III stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would drop.

The question is about two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, pp-III stopping would affect these bands. If pp-III is a major source for higher energies, then band 2 (800-900) would be affected more than band 1.

But wait, I thought that pp-III produces neutrinos with energies around 1-2 MeV. Oh, wait, maybe not. Let me think. The dominant neutrino emission comes from the Beryllium-7 (Be7) neutrinos, which are part of the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps in the few MeV range. But wait, the bands here are in the hundreds of keV. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is responsible for the production of neutrinos in the higher energy range. So, if pp-III stops, the flux in band 2 would drop more than band 1.

Wait, but neutrinos' energies are related to the reactions they come from. The electron neutrinos from the Sun are via the decay of Beryllium-7, which is part of the pp-I branch. The pp-III branch produces neutrinos through different processes, perhaps like when a carbon nucleus captures a helium-3, producing nitrogen and emitting a neutrino. Oh right, that's the CNO cycle, but wait, the C
