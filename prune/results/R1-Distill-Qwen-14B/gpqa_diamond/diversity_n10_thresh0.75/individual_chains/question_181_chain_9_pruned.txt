Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens if the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to work through it.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh right, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light (and neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So events in the core would take that time to affect us here.

The question is about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So we're looking at how the flux in these two bands compares after the pp-III branch stops.

I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy. The pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches are different parts of this chain. The pp-III branch must be one of the main contributors to neutrinos, perhaps the most abundant.

Neutrinos are produced in various reactions along the pp chain. The main types are the electron neutrinos from the beta decay of beryllium-7 in the pep and pp-I branches, but wait, I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a lot of neutrinos as well. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce neutrinos, particularly in the He-3 burning phase.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of certain neutrinos would stop. But how does that affect the flux of different energy bands?

Wait, neutrino energies are related to the energy released in their production. So each branch produces neutrinos of different energies. For example, the pep reaction produces lower energy neutrinos, while the pp-I and pp-III produce higher energies.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The pep reaction (proton + electron + proton â†’ etc.) produces lower energy neutrinos, around 1.4 MeV. The pp-I branch produces neutrinos around 5.5 MeV and 7.7 MeV. The pp-III branch... I think it produces neutrinos around higher energies, maybe around 8 MeV or so? Or am I mixing that up?

Alternatively, I recall that the dominant neutrino emission from the pp chain comes from the pp-I branch, which produces neutrinos at around 5.5 MeV and 7.7 MeV. The pp-III branch is a minor contributor but produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps around 8 MeV or even higher. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around: pp-III produces lower energy neutrinos?

Wait, no, I think the pp-III branch is actually a part of the main pp chain, which is the dominant way the Sun produces energy. The pp-III branch involves a reaction where a proton captures a helium-3 ion, producing a helium-4 and two protons, releasing a lot of energy, and this process emits a neutrino when a boron-8 decays.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the neutrino energies from each branch. The main pp-I branch produces neutrinos at 5.5 and 7.7 MeV. The pp-III branch, though, I'm not so sure.
