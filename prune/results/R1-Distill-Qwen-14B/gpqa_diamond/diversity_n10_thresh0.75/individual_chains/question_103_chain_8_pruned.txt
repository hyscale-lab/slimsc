Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's think about this.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. So, the structure is a phenyl group with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Wait, benzene is a ring with six carbons. Position 1 is where the ketone is attached. So, the substituents are at positions 3 (bromo) and 5 (nitro). Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone, so that would be a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the main group is a ketone, and the phenyl ring has two substituentsâ€”bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5.

Wait, but how are the positions arranged? Let me visualize. If the ketone is attached to position 1, then the adjacent positions are 2 and 6, but the substituents are at 3 and 5. So the substituents are meta to each other relative to the ketone. Hmm.

So the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is attached to the benzene ring, and on the same ring, there's a nitro group in the 5 position and
