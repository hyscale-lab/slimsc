Okay, so I've got this question about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me three reactions, labeled A, B, and C, and I need to figure out the major products of each. Then, I have to match them with the options provided. Let's break each part down.

Starting with reaction A: It's the dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking a β-carbon of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Wait, wait. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile here. It's like a dienolate, right? Because malonic esters are known to act as nucleophiles in such reactions. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. That structure must have an α,β-unsaturated ester group. So, the acrylate is the Michael acceptor, and the malonate is the nucleophile.

In a Michael addition, the nucleophile (like malonate) attacks the β position of the acceptor. So, the acrylate has a substituent at the β-carbon, which is the p-tolyl group. When the attack happens, the nucleophile (malonate) will add to the β position, which is the carbon adjacent to the double bond.

The product would have the nucleophile added to the β carbon. Since the starting ester is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, wait: the formula would be CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Hmm, no, the (E) configuration would be CH₂=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH₂=C-(p-tolyl)CH₂-OCH3? No, wait, I think it's CH₂=C-CH2-OCH3 with the p-tolyl group on the middle CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I should clarify the structure. The (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOCH3. So substituting at the 3 position (the CH₂=CH– part), but wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, the structure is CH₂=C-(p-tolyl)–COOCH3. No, that can't be right because acrylate is CH₂=CHCOO–. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be the third carbon. Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH₂=CH–C(p-tolyl)–OCH3? No, that doesn
