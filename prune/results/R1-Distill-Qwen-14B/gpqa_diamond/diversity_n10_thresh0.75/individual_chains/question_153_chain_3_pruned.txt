Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step. So, the question is about predicting the products of three different Michael addition reactions, and then matching them to the options given.

First, I need to recall what the Michael addition is. From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, and the reaction typically forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

The problem presents three reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). Sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it probably deprotonates something to form an enolate.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it can form an enolate. The structure of dimethyl malonate is CH₂(CO₂Me)₂. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it will deprotonate to form a resonance-stabilized enolate. The enolate will attack the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acceptor), which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

The structure of the acceptor: it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the substituents on each carbon. The substituents are the p-tolyl group (on C3) and the methyl ester on C2. The (E) configuration means the groups on either side of the double bond are opposite each other.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon (C3) of the acrylate. So the nucleophile (enolate's carbon) attaches to C3, and the double bond shifts to C2-C3. Because the reaction is a conjugate addition, the attack is on the beta position.

So, the product after the addition would have the two carbonyl groups from dimethyl malonate attached to the new carbon chain. Let me visualize this. The enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is CH₂(CO₂Me)CO₂Me) is actually when one of the alpha protons is abstracted, giving a carbanion at the central carbon. Then, adding that to the acrylate: the enolate attacks the C3, which is adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure of the acceptor is CH₂-C(O)OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. So, the enolate of dimethyl malonate (which is [CH₂CO₂Me]₂⁻) attacks the C3 (the beta position) of the acrylate. So the addition would give a new carbon-carbon bond between the two.

So, when the enolate attacks, the product would have the two malonate groups attached to the p-tolyl group. Let me think about the structure. The product would be a tricarboxylate ester. So, the product would have three ester groups: two methyl esters from the malonate and another from the original acrylate.

Wait, the structure after addition would be:

The acrylate is CH₂=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the CH. Wait, no: methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH₂=C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH₂=CHCOOCH3, but with the substituent on the CH2? Wait, no, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have
