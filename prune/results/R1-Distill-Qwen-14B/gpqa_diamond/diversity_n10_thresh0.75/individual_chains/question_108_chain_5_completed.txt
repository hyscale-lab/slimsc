Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about magnetic fields and energy terms in a hydrogen atom. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is asking me to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian expectation value due to the magnetic interaction) with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The setup is when the magnetic field B is along the Oz axis, and it's given as 1 Tesla. Also, it mentions that m is small, so maybe that's the magnetic quantum number? I remember that for hydrogen, the energy levels depend on the principal quantum number n, but m is the magnetic quantum number related to the angular momentum projection. Oh right, m can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l, so for each energy level, there are (2l+1) possible m values.

Wait, the problem says m is small. So maybe m is close to zero? Because for higher m, the splitting would be larger, but here it's small, so the splitting due to the magnetic field might be minimal.

The paramagnetic coupling term is probably the Zeeman effect. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is given by H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For the electron, the magnetic moment μ is related to the spin and orbital angular momentum. But since the question mentions orbital magnetic quantum number m, I think we're dealing with the orbital contribution, so maybe it's the normal Zeeman effect. Wait, but for hydrogen, the electron spin is also a factor, but the orbital part is separate. Hmm, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term would be due to the spin, right? Because paramagnetism is usually due to the electron's spin. Oh, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. The magnetic dipole interaction energy is given by H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is μ = -g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is the spin g-factor, and μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Or wait, orbital magnetic moment would be μ = μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) m, but I'm not too sure about the exact expression.

Wait, the paramagnetic term is due to the spin magnetic moment. So the energy term would be H_para = -μ_s · B. μ_s is the spin magnetic moment, which is μ_B * m_s, where m_s is the spin quantum number (±1/2). But wait, the problem says m is small. So if m is the orbital quantum number, then maybe m is close to zero, which would mean the orbital contribution is small. Or perhaps m here refers to the magnetic quantum number in general. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the problem says "for small values of m (orbital magnetic quantum number)". Oh, right, the orbital magnetic quantum number is m_l, which can be -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. So when m is small, like m=0, then the orbital contribution to the magnetic moment would be zero. But wait, the paramagnetic coupling term would be due to spin, which is separate. Unless the problem is considering both contributions, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism arises from the electron's spin, not the orbital angular momentum. So the paramagnetic term is the spin part. So maybe the orbital term is separate, like the Zeeman effect due to orbital motion. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: The paramagnetic effect is the contribution due to the electron's spin magnetic moment. The energy from this would be H_para = μ_B * B * m_s, because the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = μ_B m_s, where m_s is ±1/2. So the energy would be proportional to m_s, which is ±1/2. So the expectation value would be on the order of μ_B * B * (1/2). 

Wait, but wait, the problem says m is small. If m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, that's m_l. But for the paramagnetic term, m refers to the spin magnetic number m_s, which can be ±1/2. So perhaps m is 0? No, because m_s can't be zero for an electron, it's either up or down. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the terms here.

Wait, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term is the part of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field interacting with the spin, which is H_spin = μ_B B m_s. So the expectation value for the spin part would be μ_B B m_s. Given that m_s is either +1/2 or -1/2, the maximum value of this term would be (μ_B B)(1/2). 

On the other hand, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two hydrogen atom energy levels. Let's think about the hydrogen atom's energy levels. The energy levels for hydrogen are given by E_n = - (μ_e e^4)/(8 ε_0^2 h^2) * (1/n²), where μ_e is the electron mass. Wait, I can also write this as E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for example, a transition between n=2 and n=1 would have an energy difference of 10.2 eV, but the given wavelength is 0.4861 μm, which is the wavelength of the Balmer series transition from n=2 to n=1, which is the H-alpha line. So the energy ΔE is about 10.2 eV.

Wait, more accurately, the wavelength λ is related to the energy via E = hc/λ. So let's compute ΔE numerically. h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 0.4861e-6 meters. So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.088e-19 J. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ (4.088e-19)/(1.602e-19) ≈ 2.55 eV.

Wait, 0.4861 μm is about 486 nm, which is the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=2 to n=1. The energy difference between these levels is 10.2 eV. Wait, but according to my calculation, I got about 2.55 eV. Why the discrepancy?

Hmm, because I think I used the wrong approach. Let me recalculate. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. The Balmer series transition (n=2 to n=1) has a wavelength λ = 1/(R (1/1^2 - 1/2^2)) ) = 1/(1.097e4 (1 - 1/4)) ) = 1/(1.097e4 * 3/4) ) ≈ 1/(8.2275e3) ≈ 1.215e-4 m, but wait that can't be right because 1/1.097e4 is about 9.1e-5 m, which is about 90 nm. Wait, no, wait I'm getting confused. Maybe I should use the formula 1/λ = R (1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)), where n1 is the lower energy level and n2 is higher. So for the Balmer series, n1 = 1, n2 = 2. So 1/λ = R(1 - 1/4) = R * 3/4. So 1/λ= (1.097e7 m^-1) * 0.75 ≈ 8.2275e6 m^-1. So λ ≈ 1/(8.2275e6) ≈ 1.215e-7 m → 121.5 nm. But the given λ is 0.4861 μm (486 nm), which is longer. That corresponds to a different transition. Oh wait, for the Balmer-alpha line (n=3 to n=2), the wavelength is about 656 nm (red), but that's not matching. Wait, maybe I should check the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps using the energy formula E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. For n=1, E1 = -13.6 eV. So the transition from n=2 to n=1 would emit a photon of energy 10.2 eV. The wavelength would be λ = hc/E. So hc is approx 1240 eV·nm. So λ = 1240 /10.2 ≈ 121.6 nm, which is about 0.1216 μm. But the problem states λ=0.4861 μm, which is 486 nm. So that would correspond to a lower energy transition. Let's see, 486 nm is 1240 / 486 ≈ 2.55 eV. So E = 2.55 eV. That's the energy difference ΔE.

So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term is the expectation value of H, which is the Zeeman energy. H_para = μ_B * B * m_s. Wait, but μ_B is the Bohr magneton, which is about 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. m_s is ±1/2. So the expectation value would be μ_B * B * m_s. So the maximum value is (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T * (1/2) = 4.637e-24 J. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV=1.602e-19 J, so 4.637e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.895e-5 eV.

Wait, but wait a minute. Is this the correct approach? Because the paramagnetic coupling is due to the spin, which has a magnetic moment. But in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy is H = -μ·B. So the energy shift is on the order of μ_B * B. So for B=1 T, that's about 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 T = 9.27e-24 J, which is about 5.8e-6 eV. Hmm, but wait, wait: 9.27e-24 J is 9.27e-24 /1.602e-19 ≈ 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but earlier I thought the spin term is H_para = μ_B B m_s, which would be half of that for m_s=1/2. So the maximum energy shift is about 5.8e-5 eV for m_s=1. But wait, in the problem statement, m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up orbital and spin contributions.

Wait, the problem states that m (orbital magnetic quantum number) has small values. So for the orbital contribution, the energy is H_orbital = (eBħ)/(2m_e) * m_l * something. Hmm, the orbital Zeeman effect comes from the interaction of the orbital angular momentum with the magnetic field. The formula is H_orbital = (e B ħ)/(2 m_e c) * m_l. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the exact expression wrong. Alternatively, the orbital contribution is H_orbital = (μ_B B m_l ) / (something). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the orbital magnetic dipole moment is given by μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_l. So the energy would be H_orbital = - μ_orbital · B. So H_orbital = - (e ħ m_l B )/(2 m_e) * (1/ (c) ??) Wait, I'm not sure about the exact expression. Alternatively, perhaps the orbital Zeeman energy is E = (μ_B B m_l)/(something). Let me think, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_l = (ħ m_l) * (e)/(2 m_e). So μ_l = (m_l)/(l (l+1)) ) * (something), perhaps? Hmm, I'm not too confident.

Alternatively, maybe the energy due to the orbital magnetic moment is given by E_orbital = (μ_B B m_l) / (some factor). Let me look it up in my notes. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up, but I remember that the orbital contribution to the Zeeman effect is given by E_orbital = (μ_B B m_l) / (4π ε_0 c), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the energy is proportional to (m_l) times some constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term is the spin term, and the orbital term is a different contribution. But since the question specifically mentions the paramagnetic coupling term, which is due to spin, then perhaps the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but the problem says to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the spin term) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. So for ΔE being about 2.55 eV, and the paramagnetic term being about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller. So the paramagnetic term is much less than ΔE.

So the question is, which is larger: the paramagnetic term (H_para) or ΔE? The options are:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE
B) ⟨H⟩ >> ΔE
C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE
D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE

So in this case, since ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE, the correct option is C.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the question says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises from the spin, so the energy shift is proportional to the magnetic field and the spin magnetic moment. But what if the orbital contribution is considered here? Oh, the problem says "m is small", so the orbital term would be small. But the paramagnetic term is spin, which is non-zero even when m is small. Wait, but for the paramagnetic term, m is m_s, which is either +1/2 or -1/2, so the term would be about 5.8e-5 eV. Compared to ΔE of about 2.55 eV, the paramagnetic term is much smaller.

So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy. So the expectation value of H (the paramagnetic term) is much less than ΔE. So the answer is C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy \( \Delta E \) of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two quantities as follows:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises due to the interaction of the electron's spin magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). The energy shift is given by:  
   \[
   H_{\text{para}} = \mu_B B m_s
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), and \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) is the spin quantum number. Substituting these values, the maximum energy shift is:  
   \[
   H_{\text{para}} = \mu_B B \cdot \frac{1}{2} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4.637 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting this to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   H_{\text{para}} = \frac{4.637 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.895 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( 2.9 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

2. **Transition Energy \( \Delta E \)**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the energy difference between two hydrogen atom energy levels. For the given wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \), the energy is calculated using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.088 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting this to electron volts:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{4.088 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   Thus, \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

3. **Comparison**:  
   Comparing the two quantities:  
   \[
   H_{\text{para}} \approx 2.9 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}, \quad \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
   \]  
   Clearly, \( H_{\text{para}} \ll \Delta E \).

Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy \( \Delta E \). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
