Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. I remember that Lyman alpha is a specific spectral line. Oh right, Lyman alpha is the emission line of hydrogen at 121.6 nm (Angstroms?), which is in the ultraviolet range. But wait, the question says they're absorbing it. So when a cloud absorbs this wavelength from a background quasar, the absorption line would be at a longer wavelength (redshifted) depending on the redshift of the cloud.

The key here is figuring out the redshift needed such that the redshifted Lyman alpha line falls into the optical range detectable by ground-based telescopes. Because if it's in the optical, we can see it, but if it's shifted into the infrared or still in UV, maybe we can't observe it with optical telescopes.

Wait, what's the visible spectrum range? I think it's about 400-700 nm. So, the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm. That's in the UV. So if the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit * (1+z). So lambda_obs = 121.6 nm * (1+z).

We need lambda_obs to be within the optical range, say less than 700 nm (since beyond that it's infrared, which optical telescopes might not detect well? Or wait, sometimes near-infrared is observed, but maybe the question assumes optical only up to, say, 700 nm. Or perhaps more accurately, what's the maximum wavelength that ground-based optical telescopes can detect? I think it's about 1 micrometer (1000 nm), but maybe some can go a bit longer. Hmm, but maybe the limit is 700 nm to be safe.)

Wait, but the question
