Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two states. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle simultaneously. The product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) has a lower bound. I think the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the lifetime given here is Δt. Since the lifetimes are different for E1 and E2, each would have their own uncertainty in energy. Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1, right? Because that's what's needed for them to be distinguishable.

So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ΔE_i ≈ ħ/(2Δt_i). Let me make sure I get this right. The energy uncertainty depends inversely on the lifetime. So a longer lifetime (like 1e-8 sec) would mean a smaller ΔE, making the energy more precise.

But wait, we're looking for the energy difference between the two states. Let me think. To resolve two energy levels, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each has to be distinct beyond their individual uncertainties. Hmm, perhaps it's more about the uncertainty in each state affecting the minimum detectable difference.

Wait, no. Maybe the approach is to compute the uncertainty in each state's energy and ensure that the energy difference between E2 and E1 is larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if ΔE1 + ΔE2 is less than the actual energy difference (E2 - E1), then we can distinguish them.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum energy difference required is the sum of the uncertainties because otherwise, the two states might blend into each other due to their uncertainties.

Let me think about the numbers. The lifetimes are 1e-9 s for E1 and 1e-8 s for E2. Let's compute their uncertainties.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s. But since we're dealing with e
