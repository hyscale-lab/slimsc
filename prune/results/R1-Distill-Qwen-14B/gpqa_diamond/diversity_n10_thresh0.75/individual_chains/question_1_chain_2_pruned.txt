Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Two quantum states have energies E1 and E2, and their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that you can't precisely know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle at the same time. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula that comes to mind is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, the product of the energy uncertainty and the time (or lifetime) uncertainty is at least half the Planck constant.

In this case, the lifetimes are given. So, the lifetimes are Δt for each state. Wait, but wait, the question says we have two states with different lifetimes. But when we're talking about resolving two energy levels, I think we need to consider the uncertainty in the energy measurements. So, for each state, the energy uncertainty ΔE is approximately ħ divided by the lifetime.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing this up. Let me think again. So, for each state, the energy uncertainty is ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime of the state.

So for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 would be ħ/(1e-9). Similarly, for E
