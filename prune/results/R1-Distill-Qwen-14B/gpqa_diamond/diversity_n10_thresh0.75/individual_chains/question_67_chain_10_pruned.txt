Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, and their angular momentum states. Oh right, p orbitals have a quantum number l = 1. So each electron has l1 and l2 as 1.

Wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So that's |l1, l2, l, m>. So l1 is 1, l2 is 1, the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1. Right, because when you couple two l=1 particles, the possible total l's are 2, 1, 0. And here it's l=2, which is the maximum possible, so it's the triplet state in terms of angular momentum coupling.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z of each electron. The possible eigenvalues for each are -ħ, 0, or +ħ, since for l=1, m can be -1, 0, +1. So L1z and L2z can each have eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or +ħ.

The problem asks for the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being measured as -ħ. So that's the probability that both electrons have m = -1 in their individual states, but wait, no, because the total m is the sum of their individual m's. Oh, because when you add angular momenta, m_total = m1 + m2.

Wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Let me think about how that state is formed. When you couple two angular momenta l1 and l2, the total state is a combination of all possible |l1, l2, m1, m2> states that contribute to the total l and m.

So, the state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a specific combination of the individual m1 and m2 states. Because m_total = m1 + m2 = -1. So possible m1 and m2 pairs that add up to -1 are (m1, m2) = (-1, 0), (0, -1). But wait, wait. Wait
