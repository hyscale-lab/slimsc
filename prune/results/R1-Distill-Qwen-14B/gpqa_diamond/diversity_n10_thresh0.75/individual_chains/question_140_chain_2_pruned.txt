Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. So B must be a solid at room temperature but just a bit above freezing.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's known that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about each part.

First, gas W has same number of protons and neutrons. So the molecule must have a neutron number equal to proton number. So for a molecule, each atom contributes to both. Wait, but the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So for the molecule, total protons = total neutrons. Let me think of possible gases. Common gases: H2, O2, N2, CO2, CH4, NH3, etc.

Wait, the molecule's total protons equal total neutrons. Let's see. For example, H2: each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron? No, H usually has 0 neutrons, except for deuterium. So H2 has 2 protons (each H has 1) and 0 neutrons. So 2 vs 0, no. So that doesn't fit.

What about something like CH4? Each C has 6 protons and neutrons? Wait, carbon can have different isotopes. Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if W is CH4, each C is 12C (6 p,6n), H is 1H (1p,0n). So total protons:6 +4*1=10. Neutrons:6 +4*0=6. But 10â‰ 6. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe it's something like CO2. Let
