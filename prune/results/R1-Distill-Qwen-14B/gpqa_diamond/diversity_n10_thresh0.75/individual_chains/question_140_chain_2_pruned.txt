Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with a liquid Y. This reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Then, there's another part about a product of a keto acid reacting with substance X containing 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Hmm. Let's start breaking this down. 

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violently reacting... possible candidates could be things like metals reacting with acids, or maybe something like a decomposition reaction. But given that it's a violent reaction, maybe something like a metal and acid producing hydrogen gas. For example, Mg and HCl reacting to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, but wait, that's not a precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a reaction involving a carbonate and a strong acid. For example, CaCO3 reacting with HCl would produce CO2 gas, but that's not a precipitate. Alternatively, if Y is water, maybe X is something reactive like sodium or potassium. But sodium reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas, but then what's the precipitate? Sodium hydroxide is soluble, so maybe not.

Wait, maybe Y is a liquid like water, and X is a metal. Then the reaction would produce a hydroxide or oxide precipitate. For example, aluminum reacting with strong base? Or perhaps X is an alkali metal like potassium. But potassium reacting with water gives KOH, which is soluble. Hmm, maybe Y is a different liquid, like bromine? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the gas W. Its molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So each molecule has equal neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. CO2: each molecule has 12 (for C) + 16*2=32, so total protons in CO2 would be 6 (from C) + 16*2 (from O) = 38. Neutrons would be 6 (since C has 6 neutrons in its common isotope, but wait, each molecule is CO2. Each C atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons usually. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons per molecule: 6 + 16 = 22 (Wait, O has 8 protons, so 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh, same as protons. So W is CO2. Because CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons per molecule. That fits the description.

So gas W is CO2. That would suggest that in the reaction, carbon dioxide is being released. So maybe the reaction is between X and Y, producing CO2. So what could X be? If the reaction is producing CO2, perhaps X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Wait, but that would require Y to be an acid. Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid.

Wait, but the problem says that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So maybe in X, one element has a heavier isotope. For example, perhaps X is CaCO3, but that's just speculation. Alternatively, think about the product when X reacts with Y. If Y is water, and X is CaC2 (but I'm not sure). Let me think again.

Wait, considering that when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What compounds have that melting point? Let me think. Water freezes at 273 K, so 277 K is just a bit above that. So B's melting point is around 4°C. Hmm... perhaps something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: if X is a carbonate and Y is an acid, then the reaction would produce CO2 and a corresponding salt. For example, CaCO3 + HCl → CaCl2 + CO2 + H2O. But in that reaction, what would precipitate? Well, CaCl2 is soluble, so maybe not. Unless Y is a different acid. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a hydroxide, but that might not make sense.

Wait, another angle: the reaction produces a precipitate G, which upon heating gives B. So when G is heated, it decomposes into B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and B is a metal oxide? For example, heating a carbonate would remove CO2, leaving the metal oxide. Let's say G is MgCO3. Heating it would give MgO and CO2. MgO's melting point is around 2800°C, which is way higher than 4°C. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide. Heating a hydroxide might give a metal oxide. For example, heating Cu(OH)2 gives CuO and water. But Cu(OH)2 is blue, and its melting point is higher. Hmm.

Wait, the melting point of B is close to 277 K, which is about 4°C. So B is a solid (since melting point is when solid turns liquid) near that temperature. What compounds have melting points around 4°C? Well, water is 273.15 K (0°C), so 277 K is 4°C. So B's melting point is just
