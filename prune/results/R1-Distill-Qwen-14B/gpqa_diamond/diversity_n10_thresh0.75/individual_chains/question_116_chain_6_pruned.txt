Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and structures. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slowly.

First, looking at Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, NMR signals can tell us about the structure.

Triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H – that's usually from a methyl group next to something. 6H suggests maybe two methyl groups each with 3H? Or maybe a longer chain like propyl, but wait, 0.9 is typically terminal methyl. So maybe two methyl groups attached to a CH2.

Quartet at 1.3 ppm, 4H – quartet means each proton is next to a CH2 that has two neighboring groups. 4H could be two sets of two. Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like maybe a -CH2CH2- structure, where the central CH2 is split into a quartet by adjacent groups.

Putting that together, could it be two methyl groups attached to a central CH2, which is connected to another CH2? Wait, so maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that would be more H's. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl structure? Wait, neopentyl is (CH3)C-CH2CH2CH3, but that might not fit the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Or perhaps a diethyl ether? Because diethyl ether has CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3, but the NMR for that would show a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the CH2. Wait, wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. The CH3 would be a triplet from coupling with the CH2 (which is a quartet). But in this case, the triplet is at 0.9, which is typical for CH3, and the quartet is at 1.3. That fits with diethyl ether because the CH2 next to O would be around 1.3 ppm. So for diethyl ether, each CH3 is triplet, each CH2 is quartet. So 2 CH3 groups (each 3H) and 2 CH2 groups (each 2H, but in the NMR, the quartet is 4H, so that's two CH2 groups each with 2H). So that makes sense.

So Compound A is diethyl ether: CH3CH2-O-CH2CH3. When it undergoes monobromination to form compound B. Monobromination of ethers usually occurs at the less substituted position, but wait, diethyl ether has two equivalent CH2 groups adjacent to the oxygen. So where would bromination happen?

Diethyl ether is symmetrical, so monobromination would not give different products. Wait, but maybe the bromine is adding to the oxygen as a leaving group? No, wait, monobromination typically refers to substitution. Wait, ethers can undergo SN2 substitution if they're good enough leaving groups. Diethyl ether isn't a great leaving group, but perhaps under certain conditions.

Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction. Wait, no, the question says monobromination. So perhaps it's a substitution, but diethyl ether has two possible sites. But since it's symmetric, the product would still be the same. So Compound B would be a brominated diethyl ether. Wait, how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. Diethyl ether has a structure where each ethyl group is CH2CH3 attached to O. If it undergoes monobromination, perhaps it's an SN2 attack on one of the CH2 groups. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider that diethyl ether (A) is actually not the right structure.

Wait, another possibility for the NMR: maybe it's a compound with two methyl groups as triplets and a central CH2CH2 group. Oh, wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, that's neopentane. Or perhaps 2,2-dimethylbutane? Wait, no, let me think about the integration. The triplet is 6H, which is two groups of 3H each. The quartet is 4H, which is two groups of 2H each. So maybe it's a structure where two methyl groups (each 3H) are attached to a central CH2, which is connected to another CH2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to something else, like a cyclohexane ring. Wait, but then the NMR would show more signals. Alternatively, maybe it's a gem-dimethyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the structure is (CH3
