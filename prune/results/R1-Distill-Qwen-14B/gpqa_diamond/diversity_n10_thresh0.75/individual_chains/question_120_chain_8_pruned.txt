Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star, the larger the parallax. Right, so parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/distance, something like that.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So they're asking about the number density of stars as a function of parallax. Let me think about the distribution.

Assuming that stars are uniformly distributed in space, which I think means their number density is uniform. Wait, number density would be the same everywhere, but how does that translate to the number per unit parallax? Because parallax depends on distance, so the same number density at different distances would contribute differently when considering parallax ranges.

Let me model this. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a volume element dV would be n * dV, where n is the number density. Now, I need to express this in terms of parallax.

Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4πd² dd. So dV = 4πd² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx, so d in terms of plx is d = 1/plx. So dd = - (1/plx²) d plx? Wait, maybe I should express d in terms of plx and then find the volume element in terms of plx.

Let me try again. Parallax plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume element around a star at distance d is a thin spherical shell with radius d and thickness dd. So the volume of this shell is 4πd² dd. But since we're dealing with parallax, which is 1/d, let's change variables from d to plx.

We have plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx. Differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Since plx increases as d decreases, but when plx increases, d decreases, so maybe it's better to express the volume element in terms of plx.

So substituting, d² = (1/plx)^2 = 1/plx². And dd = -(1/plx²) d plx. So the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx²) * [ - (1/plx²) d plx ].

Wait, but the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering a range of plx, perhaps we can take the absolute value or just consider the magnitude. So the volume element in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate. The volume element for a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So in terms of plx, d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/plx². And dd = (d plx)/(d plx/d) Wait, not sure. Let's compute dd in terms of d plx.

Since plx = 1/d, d plx = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² d plx. So substituting, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. So when we substitute into the volume element:

dV = 4π d² dd = 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx²) d plx.

Wait, that gives dV as negative, but since we're dealing with the magnitude, perhaps we can write dV = 4π (1/plx²) (1/plx²) d plx, ignoring the sign.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again. The volume element is 4π d² dd. d = 1 / plx. So d² =
