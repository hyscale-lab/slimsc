Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li has 3 protons normally, but if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, since 3 protons and 3 neutrons add up to 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion.

I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, I need to use the relativistic equations. The energy of a particle is given by the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Oh wait, but sometimes people use different terms. The total energy is gamma times the rest energy. So E = gamma * m0cÂ².

But wait, the question is asking for the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so for each ion, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. But I think the problem is asking for the kinetic energy plus the rest energy, or just the kinetic? Wait, no, the question says the energy of the collider. I think colliders typically specify the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, wait. In high-energy physics, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. Or does it? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, no. When they talk about the energy of the collider
