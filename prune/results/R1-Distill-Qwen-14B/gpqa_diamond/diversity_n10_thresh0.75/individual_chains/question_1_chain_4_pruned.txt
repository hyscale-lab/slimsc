Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish these two levels. The options are A to D, with different exponents of 10.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the energy uncertainty to the lifetime of the state. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime of the state.

So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is about ħ divided by twice the lifetime. Let me jot that down. So for E1, ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(2*10^-9 s), and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(2*10^-8 s).

But wait, since the energy differences are between E1 and E2, I think the energy difference ΔE must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties to be clearly distinguishable. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart. So ΔE should be greater than (ΔE1 + ΔE2). 

Wait, no, wait. Actually, when considering two states, each has their own uncertainty. So the combined uncertainty would probably be the sum, or maybe the maximum of the two? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think of it as the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for either state. Or perhaps the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let me think. 

Suppose E1 has a larger uncertainty because its lifetime is shorter. Because 10^-9 is shorter than 10^-8. Since the uncertainty is inversely proportional to lifetime, the shorter the lifetime, the higher the uncertainty. So E1 has a larger ΔE (like, higher uncertainty) than E2.

So to resolve the two states, the energy difference has to be bigger than the uncertainty in each. So the minimum ΔE is the maximum of the two uncertainties. Or maybe the sum? Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate each uncertainty and see what the minimal ΔE is.

Let me calculate each ΔE. I'll need the value of ħ. I remember ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, the options are in eV, so maybe I should convert ħ into eV·s. Let me recall that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So 1 eV·s is 1.602e-19 J·s.

So ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Let's convert that to eV·s:

ħ (eV·s) = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2 * t1) where t1 is 1e-9 s.

So ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s)
