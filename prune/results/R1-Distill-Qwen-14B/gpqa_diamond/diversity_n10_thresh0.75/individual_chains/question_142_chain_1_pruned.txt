Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. When the density matrix is a pure state, it can be written as |ψ><ψ|, but here it looks like a mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, so this ρ is a diagonal matrix because the terms are |0><0| and |1><1|. Let me write that out. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and then multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a 2x2 matrix with 1/2 on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere.

I remember that for a qubit, any state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere has coordinates (x, y, z), where the point is given by r = (x, y, z). For a pure state |ψ>, the Bloch vector is found using the coefficients in the state's expansion in the computational basis.

But wait, this is a mixed state, not a pure state. So how does that affect the Bloch representation? Oh right, for mixed states, the density matrix can't be written as a single outer product of a ket. Instead, it's a statistical mixture.

Wait, the density matrix given is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That looks like a completely mixed state for a qubit. Because in the computational basis, it's equally likely to be in state |0> or |1>, regardless of any interference or coherences. So in the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state should be at the center of the Bloch sphere.

What's the center of the Bloch sphere? It's the origin, so r=(0,0,0). Let me think about the general form. For a qubit, any state
