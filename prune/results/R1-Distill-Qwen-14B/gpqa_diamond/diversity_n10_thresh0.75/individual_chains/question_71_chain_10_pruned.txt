Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets in a system. The setup says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered via the TTV method, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All planets have the same albedo, so that should simplify things a bit.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the inverse square law. I remember that the temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L_star / L_sun) / (a / a_earth)^2 )^(1/4), but maybe I can simplify it because all planets are around the same star, so L_star is the same for all. So the ratio of their temperatures would depend on their distances.

But wait, how do the orbital periods relate to the distance from the star? Oh right, Kepler's third law. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So for a star like our Sun, P^2 = a^3, but more generally, a^3 = (G*M*P^2)/(4π²), but since all the planets are around the same star, M is the same, so a is proportional to (P)^(2/3). So if the periods are in a ratio, their distances are proportional to (P)^(2/3).

So first, let's get the orbital periods ratio. The periods are 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 5 for the planets 1 through 5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2*P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5*P1, Planet_2 is P2=2*P1.

The distances a are proportional to (P)^(2/3). So the ratio of a4 to a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3).
