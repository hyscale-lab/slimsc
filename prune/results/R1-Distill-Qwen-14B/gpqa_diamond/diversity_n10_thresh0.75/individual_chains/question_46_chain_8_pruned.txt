Okay, so I've got this question about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic compound. Hmm, let me think. The compound is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, right? But when it reacts, maybe the stereochemistry doesn't matter because the catalyst might not care about the configuration. Or does it?

Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. I remember that Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium based, and it's used for breaking and reforming carbon-carbon double bonds. Metathesis... so the reaction breaks the double bonds and swaps the ends.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH₃)-. Wait, no, wait. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₃. But with a 3-methyl group, so carbon 3 has a methyl branch. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons. 1-ene is the first carbon as double bond. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a methyl on carbon 3. So carbon 3 would have a CH(CH3) group? Let me count:
