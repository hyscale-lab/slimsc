Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are different.

The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. So it's a harmonic oscillator, but considering relativity.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be derived from the conservation of energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy at maximum speed is (1/2)mv_max². So (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the classical answer, which is option C. But since it's relativistic, I think the answer isn't that simple.

In relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy of the oscillator includes both kinetic and potential, and in the maximum displacement (A), all the energy is potential. Then, when the mass passes through the equilibrium point, all that potential is converted into kinetic energy, but now in relativistic terms.

Wait, but wait. The potential energy of a relativistic harmonic oscillator isn't the same as the classical case. I'm a bit confused here. Oh wait, the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx. So maybe the potential energy is the same as classical, which is (1/2)kx². But the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total energy at maximum amplitude would be E = (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), all this energy is kinetic. So, E = (gamma - 1)mc².

So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1)mc².

But I'm not sure if this approach is correct. Another thought: in the relativistic
