Okay, so I've got this question about the equilibrium temperatures of two planets orbiting a star. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal balance, right? So the energy it absorbs equals the energy it emits.

The question gives me a lot of data. Let me jot down the key points.

The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. So, the star is a bit more massive and larger than the Sun, but its temperature is a bit lower? Wait, but how does that affect the planets' temperatures?

Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much energy is reflected vs absorbed.

They both orbit the star in circular orbits, so the distance from the star is the same for each planet? Wait, no, the RV method and transit method detect different things. Oh, wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit, and the transit gives the size of the planet. But in this question, I think the focus is on their orbital periods or distances, but the question doesn't directly give the orbital radii. Hmm, wait, but the Doppler shifts are given for each planet. Oh, right, the Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the problem says Planet1 induces a shift of 0.03 Å in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. Oh, but wait, Doppler shift is about the velocity of the star. How does that relate to orbital parameters?

But maybe I don't need to get into that. The question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the orbital distances. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the distances from the star based on the RV measurements. Because the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and the distance from the star.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / ( (1 + m/M)^{2/3} ) )) )

Wait, maybe a simpler approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (2πG) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

But perhaps another approach. The Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is related to the velocity (v) via Δλ/λ = v/c. So the observed shift is 0.03 Å for Planet1, and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The rest wavelength is 6300 Å.

So, the velocity is (Δλ/λ) * c. Let's compute the velocities.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e5 km/s, but in terms of units, 3e5 km/s is 3e8 m/s, but wait, the Doppler shift is in terms of wavelength shift. Let me think, the shift is small, so we can use the approximation Δλ/λ ≈ v/c.

Let me calculate the velocities.

For Planet1: Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So Δλ/λ = 0.03 / 6300 ≈ 4.76e-6.

v1 = c * (Δλ/λ) = 3e5 km/s * 4.76e-6 ≈ 1.428 km/s.

Similarly, for Planet2: Δλ = 0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

v2 = 3e5 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1.9047 km/s.

These velocities are the semi-amplitudes of the star's motion due to the planets. Since the star's mass is much larger than the planets, the semi-amplitude K relates to the planet's orbital velocity via Kepler's laws.

Wait, the velocity of the star (v) is related to the planet's orbital speed (v_p). Because the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, but since the star is much more massive, the planet's velocity is much higher. The relation is v = (M_p / (M_star + M_p)) * v_p ≈ (M_p / M_star) * v_p.

But wait, maybe a better approach is to relate the semi-amplitude K (star's velocity) to the planet's orbital period and distance.

The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / ( (P * (1 day))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward to use the formula:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )

But perhaps I should instead think in terms of Kepler's third law. The star's velocity v is linked to the planet's orbital period and semi-major axis.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( ( (M_star + M_p) )^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But maybe it's better to relate the planet's velocity to the orbital radius.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the equilibrium temperature formula.

The equilibrium temperature T_e is given by the equation:

T_e = T_star * ( ( R_star / (2 a) ) )^(-1/2) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )^(1/4)

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

T_e = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(-1/2) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

Wait, let me recall. The star's flux at the planet's distance is L/(4π a
