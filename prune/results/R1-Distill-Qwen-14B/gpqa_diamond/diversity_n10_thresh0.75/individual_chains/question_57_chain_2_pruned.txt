Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my scattering theory, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts provided are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The task is to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are all given in femtometers, which is a unit of length. So I'm guessing the calculation involves some formula that relates phase shifts to the scattering amplitude.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the phase shifts δₗ. The general formula for the scattering amplitude is something like f(θ) = (1/(2i)) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{2iδₗ} - 1 ) * Pₗ(cosθ) ), where the sum is over all the angular momentum states l. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact expression.

Wait, another thought: the partial wave expansion. Right, the scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over partial waves. Each term is proportional to (2l+1) e^{2iδₗ} (something with the Legendre polynomial Pₗ(cosθ)).

But the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, wait, when θ is zero, cosθ is 1. So Pₗ(1) is just 1 for all l because Pₗ(1) is 1. Oh, right, because Legendre polynomials have Pₗ(1)=1 for any l. So for θ=0, each term in the sum becomes (2l+1) e^{2iδₗ} * 1, multiplied by 1/(2i).

Wait, so the scattering amplitude f(0) would be the sum from l=0 to 4 (since those are the given phase shifts) of (2l+1) e^{2iδₗ} divided by (2i). But wait, the problem says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess we only sum up to l=4.

So f(0) = [sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) e^{2iδ
