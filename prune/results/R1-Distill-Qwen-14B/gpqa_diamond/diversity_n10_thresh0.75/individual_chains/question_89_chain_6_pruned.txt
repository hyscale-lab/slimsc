Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78Â°C, followed by addition of dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I'll try to figure out what each reaction does.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, pretty rigid. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on adjacent carbons? Wait, no, wait. Adamantane's structure is like a diamond fragment, with each carbon connected in a way that's very rigid. The 1 and 3 positions are probably on adjacent carbons in some bridge structure.

Heating it with KOH. That sounds like an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Since there's excess KOH, maybe it's a strong base, so E2 mechanism. So two molecules of HBr would be eliminated, forming a double bond. But where?

1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules when heated with a strong base. The positions of the Br atoms are 1 and 3, so elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Wait, no, because the structure of adamantane is such that each bridgehead is connected to three other carbons. So perhaps when two adjacent bridgeheads are brominated, eliminating HBr would form a double bond between those bridgeheads, leading to an allene or something similar.

Wait, but wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So if the molecule is symmetric, maybe the elimination leads to a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we're looking at a structure where each Br is on a bridgehead. Eliminating two HBr would create a double bond between those bridgeheads, making a more strained structure, but adamantane is already highly strained in some ways.

Wait, but when two vic
