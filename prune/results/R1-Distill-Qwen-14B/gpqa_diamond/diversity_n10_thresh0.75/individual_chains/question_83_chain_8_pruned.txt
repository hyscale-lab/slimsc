Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me read through it again. Alright, the question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. The goal is to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll try to break down what's happening. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with a strong base like NaOH, you're doing a neutralization reaction. The reaction should produce the acetate ion and water.

So, the initial step is diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Let me calculate the new concentration after dilution. I think the formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 would be (M1 * V1) / V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³ (since 20 + 20). So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40. That would be (1) / 40, which is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid has a concentration of 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Wait, so the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. Volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) times 0.025 M. Moles = 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. Volume of NaOH needed would be (0.001 mol) / (0.1 mol/L) = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. Oh, right, 25% of the equivalence point volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, no, wait. The 25% titration refers to 25% of the equivalence point. So when you reach 25% of the equivalence point, you've added 25% of the required NaOH volume.

So, equivalence point volume is 10 cm³, right? So 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, perhaps I should approach this step by step. Let me think about the two parts: pH at 25% titration and pH at equivalence point.

Starting with the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution
