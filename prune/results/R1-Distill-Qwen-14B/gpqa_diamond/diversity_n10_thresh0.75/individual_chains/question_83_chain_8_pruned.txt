Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I need to think it through step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The problem gives me the initial volume and concentration of acetic acid, and then it's diluted with water. After that, it's being titrated with NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let me write down the given information:

- Volume of acetic acid: 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.02 L)
- Concentration of acetic acid: 0.05 M
- They add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L) after dilution.
- The NaOH used is 0.1 M.
- The question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, so first, after dilution, what's the concentration of acetic acid? Because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves. Oh wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, so after adding equal volume, the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 0.02 L) / 0.04 L. Let me compute that: (0.001 mol) / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

But wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. The number of moles of acetic acid is 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ water, the volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that makes sense.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH would be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O
