Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. 

Wait, I remember that redshift is a measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the redshift, the farther away the object is. So, if something has a high redshift, its light is shifted into longer wavelengths. 

The question mentions that the hydrogen clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Oh right, Lyman alpha is the series of spectral lines from hydrogen where the electron transitions to the n=1 energy level. But wait, the Lyman alpha line itself is at about 121.6 nanometers, which is 1216 Angstroms, right. So that's the rest wavelength.

Now, when these clouds absorb this light, they're at a redshifted wavelength as seen from us. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms if there's a redshift. But wait, the absorption line is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's rest frame, but we observe it at a longer wavelength because of redshift.

The key here is whether this redshifted wavelength is in the optical range. Because if the observed wavelength is in the optical, ground-based telescopes can detect it. But if it's shifted into the infrared, then maybe ground-based telescopes can't see it as easily, unless they have instruments that go into IR. But the question is about optical telescopes, so I think they can't detect beyond a certain wavelength.

Wait, optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nm, or about 4000 to 7000 Angstroms. So if the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame, and if the redshift z is such that 1216*(1+z) is less than 7000 Angstroms, then the observed wavelength would be in the optical. Wait, is that right? Because when you have redshift, the observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). So if lambda_obs is 7000 Angstroms, what's the maximum z that brings 1216*(1+z) <=7000?

Wait, the lower limit on redshift would be the smallest z for which the observed wavelength is still in the optical range. Wait, no, actually, wait. Because higher redshift means more stretching, so the observed wavelength would be longer. So the lower limit on z is the point where the observed wavelength is just entering the optical. Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, no, sorry. If the cloud is at a higher z, then the Lyman alpha absorption line is observed at a longer wavelength. So if the cloud is too far (high z), the observed wavelength might go beyond optical into the infrared, which optical telescopes can't see. So the lower limit on z would be the point where the Lyman alpha line is just within the optical range. So, for example, if the observed wavelength is 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), then the maximum z would be when 1216*(1+z) = 7000. But wait, the question is about the lower limit, so perhaps I'm getting it mixed up.

Wait, no, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z needed so that the absorption line is still in the optical. Wait, because if the cloud is too close (low z), the observed wavelength could be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't detect because the atmosphere blocks UV light. Oh, right! So ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the Lyman alpha line is observed in the UV, then ground-based telescopes can't detect it. Therefore, the cloud must have a redshift such that the Lyman alpha line is shifted into the optical range. 

So the condition is that the observed wavelength lambda_obs must be greater than the cutoff between UV and optical. Let's say the cutoff is about 300 nm (3000 Angstroms). Wait, but I think the actual cutoff is lower, but perhaps the optical telescopes can't observe below 400 nm. Let me think. The atmosphere is opaque to UV below about 300 nm, so the ground-based telescopes can't observe wavelengths much below that. So if the observed Lyman alpha is above 300 nm, then it's in the optical range, which can be detected. 

So we need to find the redshift z where lambda_obs = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z) is equal to 300 nm (3000 Angstroms), because anything lower than that would be in the UV and not detectable. So solving for z:

1216 * (1 + z) = 3000
1 + z = 3000/1216 ≈ 2.467
z ≈ 1.467

So about z ≈ 1.47. So any redshift higher than that would result in the Lyman alpha line being observed at longer wavelengths (redder), so in the optical range. So the lower limit on z is approximately 1.47. Looking at the options, option B is 1.2, which is lower, and option D is 1.9, which is higher. So the lower limit would be the minimum z where the line is still in the optical. Therefore, any z above
