Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I get the details right.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex? They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, KCa-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so each Ca²+ binds with one EDTA molecule.

The formation constant, Kf, is given as 5e10. Kf is a measure of the stability of the complex. A high Kf means the complex is very stable, so the concentration of free Ca²+ ions should be low.

The solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote the complex as [CaEDTA]^2−. So the initial concentration of this complex is 0.02 M.

In the solution, the complex will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. The reaction can be written as:

[CaEDTA]^2− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−] / [CaEDTA^2−]

Wait, no, actually formation constant is the reverse of this. Because Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the correct equation is:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ [CaEDTA]^2−  
Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−})

So, given that, if the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the dissociation is minimal (since Kf is large), then the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− will be approximately equal and much smaller than 0.02 M.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The complex is in solution at 0.02 M. So, initially, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are mostly zero. But as it dissociates, some Ca²+ and
