Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Maxwell's equations, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in our universe, magnets are dipoles—they have both a North and South pole, and you can't isolate a single pole. I think this is related to one of Maxwell's equations. Oh right! The divergence of the magnetic field is zero. So the equation is ∇·B = 0. That's because if there were isolated poles, you'd have something like monopoles, which would change that equation.

So the question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would change in a universe where such monopoles exist. Let me recall the four equations:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0 (this might change)
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our universe, equation 2 says that magnetic monopoles don't exist, so the divergence of B is zero. If in this other universe, they do exist, equation 2 would have to change. But wait, what about the other equations? Do any of them change as well?

I think Maxwell's equations are a set that needs to be consistent. If you introduce magnetic monopoles, you can't just change equation 2 without affecting others. Because, from what I remember, if you have magnetic charge, it would modify the other equations too.

So, if we have isolated magnetic poles, we can think of them as having 'magnetic charge'—like a magnetic version of electric charge. Then, Gauss's law for magnetism would become ∇·B = ρ_m / something, similar to how Gauss's law for E is with charge density.

But also, Faraday's Law might change. Because if you have a magnetic current, then the curl of E would have an additional term. Wait, in our universe, Faraday's Law says that the curl of E is the negative rate of change of B. But if there's a magnetic current
