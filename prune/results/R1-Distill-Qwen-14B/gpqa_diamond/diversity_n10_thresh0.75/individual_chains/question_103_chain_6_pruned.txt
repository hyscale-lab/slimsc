Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis questions can be tricky. Let's see what the question is asking.

The goal is to find the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a set of reactions.

First, I'll try to sketch the target molecule. The substituents are a nitro group and a bromine on the benzene ring, and a ketone group attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the formula is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benzene ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions. The ketone is on the ethyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, actually, the structure would be a benzene ring with a nitro group at position 3 and a bromine at position 5, and attached to the ring (probably position 1) is a carbonyl group (ethan-1-one means a ketone attached to the benzene via a methyl group, I think. So the structure is phenyl-C(O)-CH3, but the substituents on the phenyl are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone group.

Wait, no. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. So the ketone is at position 1 of ethane, which is the same as the benzene ring attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the benzene is attached to a carbonyl group, making it a ketone (like acetophenone). The substituents on the benzene are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

So, the substituents are meta and para? Wait, no. Let me imagine the benzene ring attached to the ketone (position 1). The nitro group is at position 3, which is meta to the ketone, and the bromine is at position 5, which is also meta relative to position 3. Wait, no. Let me clarify. On the benzene ring, the carbonyl is at position 1. Then, the
