Okay, let's try to figure out this chemistry problem. Hmm, so there are two reactions given, and I need to find the right reagents A and B from the options.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So this looks like a nucleophilic addition reaction. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic additions with compounds like CN-.

Wait, but in the product, the oxygen is now an alcohol. Oh, right! There's a two-step process here. First, the nucleophilic attack: the ketone would react with CN- to form a cyanohydrin. But then, the solvent and conditions matter. Or wait, maybe the reaction is done under certain acidic conditions to protonate something.

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ product. So NaCN provides the CN- nucleophile. But for the formation of a cyanohydrin, which is what this product looks like, the ketone reacts with CN- to form the addition product. But sometimes, the reaction might require an acid catalyst. Because in the formation of cyanohydrin from a ketone, acid is typically used to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile.

So in the first step, A might be H3O+ (which is an acid). That would make sense because H3O+ is a
