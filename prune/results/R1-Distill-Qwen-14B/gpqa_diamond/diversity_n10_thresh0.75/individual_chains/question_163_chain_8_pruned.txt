Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully again.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, let's break this down. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, which means it's a base. To dissolve it, we probably need an acid because acids and bases will neutralize each other. Since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, adding a strong acid should help dissolve it.

First, I should calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 to find out how many moles we have. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is 1 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. Fe is 55.85, each OH is 17 (16+1), and there are three OH groups. So 3 *17 is 51. Adding 55.85 gives 106.85 g/mol. Yep, that's correct.

The mass of Fe(OH)3 we have is 0.1 grams. So the number of moles is mass divided by molar mass: 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that: 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 mol, which is 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid like HCl, it will neutralize the hydroxide ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions (from the strong acid).

So the moles of H+ needed will be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. That's 3 * 9.36e-4 = 0.002808 moles of H+.

The strong acid provided is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so the volume (in liters) needed is moles divided by concentration. Wait, but wait, the acid is monobasic, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So for HCl, it's 1:1.

So the volume V = moles of H+ / Molarity = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. But wait, wait a second. The question asks for the minimum volume needed. But does the solution volume matter here? Because when you add the acid to the solution, the total volume increases. But wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh, I see. So the 100 cm³ is the final solution volume after dissolving the Fe(OH)3 and adding the acid. So the acid volume plus the solution volume should be 100 cm³? Or is 100 cm³ the total volume already, including the added acid? Hmm, perhaps I need to think about this.

Wait, the problem says "dissolve
