Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux ratio question. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly. The Sun, as I remember, produces neutrinos through various processes, mainly in the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is one of those steps, right? So if that stops, there must be a change in the neutrino fluxes we receive on Earth.

Wait, neutrinos come from different parts of the Sun's fusion processes. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle. I think in the pp chain, protons fuse to make deuterium, then helium-3, and finally, two helium-3s combine into helium-4. The pp-III branch must be one of the steps involving helium-3 and deuterium or something.

If the pp-III branch stops, I guess that affects the production of certain neutrinos. Neutrinos from the Sun are mainly electron neutrinos, produced in the beta decay steps. So, in the proton-proton chain, beta decay happens when a boron-8 nucleus (I think that's from the He + CNO cycle?) decays into Be-8 and emits a neutrino. Or wait, noâ€”maybe the neutrinos come from the beta decay in the pp chain steps.

Wait, the main neutrino sources in the Sun are: 

1. The proton-proton chain (pp) producing He-4, with neutrinos from the decay of Beryllium-7 to Boron-7 (or something like that? Maybe Be-8 to two He-4
