Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let's see what I can figure out.

First, the IR data. The strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 probably indicate N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has an amide or something with an amine group, those peaks might be from N-H. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a key one. That's typically a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. So, looking at the options, all of them have carbonyls except maybe some, but let's not jump yet.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t, 3H). That's a typical ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2. So maybe an ethyl group attached to something else, like an oxygen or a carbonyl.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad singlet could be an -OCH2- group, maybe an ether or ester. Or perhaps an amine, but that's usually downfield more. Hmm, but the integration is 2H, so maybe two protons on an oxygen-linked CH2.

- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q, 2H). Quartet with 2H. Quartet usually comes from splitting with two neighboring protons. So if it's a quartet, maybe this is a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. The 4.5 ppm is a bit higher, so could be an ester group. Like OCO-OCH2CH3, but wait, the ethyl is at 1.20. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen and adjacent to another CH2 that's split into a quartet. So maybe an ethyl ester: O-CO-OCH2CH3, but wait, the ethyl in the ester would be a triplet, right? Because the CH3 would be a triplet from the adjacent CH2. Oh wait, in the NMR, the 1.20 is a triplet, which fits the CH3 of an ethyl group attached to oxygen. So maybe that's an ethoxy group.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an NH group, but earlier in IR we saw the N-H. Or maybe it's an OCH2 group where the protons are not split much. Alternatively, could be part of an amide.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). So two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, like two substituents in the para positions. So maybe the ring has two substituents, each with two protons each, as doublets. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each giving a doublet. Wait, but in the case of para substitution, the two protons on the ring would each be next to substituents, leading to a doublet each. So, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with two groups.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, that's meta substitution, but the aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. Because if substitution is at 3, the adjacent protons might give different splitting. Or wait, benzamide has a CONH2 group. So substituents would be eth
