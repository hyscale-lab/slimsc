Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember that in stars, the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is related to the temperature. Oh right, it's something to do with the Boltzmann distribution. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So the excitation level of star_1 is higher. Wait, but what does that mean about their temperatures?

Boltzmann's equation comes into play here. The equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels is equal to the Boltzmann factor. So the formula is (n2)/(n1) = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). 

In this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me see. Star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2. So for star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is n_1, and for star_2, it's n_2. The question states that n_1 = 2 * n_2. Or wait, no. Wait, the problem says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio is n1/n2 = 2?

Wait, no, I think I need to double-check. The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So suppose the excited level is level 2, and the ground state is level 1
