Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's read the question again carefully.

We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³⁻, in this solution.

The question also provides the Ka values for H₃PO₄: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Hmm, okay. So I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The phosphoric acid dissociates in steps:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4⁻ (Ka1)
2. H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the third dissociation step. So I need to figure out how much HPO4^2- will dissociate to give PO4^3-.

Looking at the substances given, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write their dissociations:

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ + H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O (assuming the water is just part of the formula, so when dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ + HPO4^2-.

So the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but how do these relate? Since H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose another to become PO4^3-.

But wait, the presence of both H2
